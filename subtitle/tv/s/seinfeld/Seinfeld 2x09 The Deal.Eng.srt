1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,678
I was watching women in the
department store trying on clothes.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,956
And I notice that they do it
differently from men.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,869
Women don't try on the clothes,
they get behind the clothes.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,870
They take a dress off the rack...

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,271
...and they hold it up
against themself.

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,112
They can tell something from this.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,511
They stick one leg way out.

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,559
They need to know, " If someday I'm
one-legged at a 45-degree angle...

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,517
...what am I gonna wear?"

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,152
You never see a man do that,
see a guy take a suit off the rack...

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,995
...put his head in the neck, go, "What
about this suit? I'll get it. Looks fine.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,879
Put some shoes by the bottom
of the pants. I want to make sure.

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,952
Perfect. Now, what if I'm walking?
Move the shoes, move the shoes.

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,759
Move the shoes."

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,068
What are you doing?

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,071
All right. All right.

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,913
What's the matter with that?
What about that one?

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,435
Robert Vaughn,
The Helsinki Formula?

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,356
He was good in
Man From U.N. C.L.E.

20
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,308
Guess whose birthday
is coming up soon.

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,473
I know. I know. I'm having
my root canal the same week.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,111
I hope you got a good oral surgeon,
because that can be very serious.

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,795
Hey, lookit. Naked people.

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,235
No, I don't want to see
the naked people.

25
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,910
Been a while?

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,432
I have a vague recollection
of doing something with someone...

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,670
...but it was a long, long time ago.

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,473
I think my last time
was in Rochester.

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,593
My hair was a lot shorter.

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,910
I remember that it's a good thing.

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,510
And someday, I hope to do it again.

32
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,548
What?

33
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,233
What?

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,995
- What was that look?
- What look?

35
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,919
The look you just gave me.

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,718
- I gave a look?
- Yes.

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,829
- What kind of a look?
- I know that look.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,355
- So, what was it?
- Why should I tell you?

39
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,353
Well, you're the big look expert.

40
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,193
I want to see how smart you are.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,436
Trust me. I know the look.

42
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,388
- So?
- What?

43
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,755
- What about the look?
- I don't know.

44
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,353
- You got something on your mind?
- No.

45
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,909
Things pop into your head.

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,673
You?

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,751
Things occur to me
from time to time.

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,751
Yeah. Me too.

49
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,199
Well, you can't expect to just
forget the past completely.

50
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,952
Well, no, of course not.

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,510
I mean, it's something we did.

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,716
Probably about...

53
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,233
...what, 25 times.

54
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,631
Thirty-seven.

55
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,110
Yeah, we pretty much know
what we're doing in there.

56
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,912
- We know the terrain.
- No big surprises.

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,718
Nope.

58
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,834
- What do you think?
- I don't know. What do you think?

59
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,517
Well, it's something to consider.

60
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,718
- Yeah.
- I mean, let's say...

61
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,394
...what if...

62
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,357
...we did?
- What if?

63
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,875
Is that, like, the end of the world
or something?

64
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,600
- Certainly not.
- Why shouldn't we be able to do that...

65
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,228
...once in a while if we want to?
- I know.

66
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,356
I mean, really, what is the big deal?

67
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,953
We go in there...

68
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,510
...we're in there for a while,
then we come back out here.

69
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,239
That's not complicated.

70
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,231
It's almost stupid if we didn't.

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,278
- It's moronic.
- Absurd.

72
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,033
Course...

73
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,154
...I guess maybe some little
problems could arise.

74
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,514
There are always a few.

75
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,671
I mean, if anything happened...

76
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,879
...and we couldn't be friends the way
we are now, that would really be bad.

77
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,238
- Devastating.
- Because this is very good.

78
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,231
And that would be good.

79
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,356
That would be good too.

80
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,959
The idea is to combine the this...

81
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,951
...and the that.

82
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,635
But this cannot be disturbed.

83
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,553
Yeah, we just want to take this...

84
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,518
...and add that.

85
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,988
But of course, we'd have
to figure out a way...

86
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,038
...to avoid the things that
cause the little problems.

87
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,919
Maybe some rules or something.

88
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,559
For example:

89
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,351
Now I call you whenever
I'm inclined, and vice versa.

90
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,751
But if we did that, we might feel...

91
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,036
...a certain obligation to call.

92
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,270
Well, why should that be?

93
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,711
I have an idea.

94
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,668
No calls the day after that.

95
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,239
Beautiful.

96
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,634
Let's make it a rule.

97
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,518
All right, sir.

98
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,838
- Now, here's another little rule.
- Yeah.

99
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,672
When we see each other now...

100
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,751
...we retire to our separate quarters.

101
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,957
But sometimes when people
get involved with that...

102
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,350
...they feel pressure...

103
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,795
...to sleep over.

104
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,078
When that...

105
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,719
...is not really sleep.

106
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,153
Sleep is separate from that,
and I don't see...

107
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,348
...why sleep got all tied up
and connected...

108
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,353
...with that.

109
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,198
Okay, okay, rule number two:
Spending the night is optional.

110
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,589
Well, now we're getting somewhere.

111
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,118
Good.

112
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,951
- What about the kiss good night?
- Tough one.

113
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,198
Your call.

114
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,994
It's bourgeois.

115
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,673
Fine.

116
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,554
Well.

117
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,593
Well.

118
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,154
You ready?

119
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,513
Ready.

120
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,239
So you think you can handle this?

121
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,311
Definitely.

122
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,273
- Hey.
- Hey.

123
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,350
- Got the paper?
- Not yet.

124
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,033
- No paper.
- I haven't been out yet.

125
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,749
Well, what's taking you so long?

126
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,913
Oh, yeah.

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,278
What's the deal with Aquaman?

128
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,112
Could he go on the land,
or was he just restricted to water?

129
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,796
No, I think I saw him on land
a couple times.

130
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,475
So how's the job situation going?

131
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,834
Still looking.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,468
Pretty bad out there.
What about you?

133
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,756
Nothing much.
I slept with Elaine last night.

134
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,713
Oxygen. I need some oxygen.

135
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,030
- This is major.
- I thought you'd like that.

136
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,838
Oh, this is huge!

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,276
- I know.
- All right, okay. Let's go. Details.

138
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,953
No, I can't give details.

139
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,276
- You what?
- I can't give details.

140
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,353
No details?

141
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,758
I'm not in the mood.

142
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,676
You ask me here to have lunch...

143
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,671
...tell me you slept with Elaine...

144
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,832
...and then say you're not
in the mood for details.

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,991
Now, you listen to me.

146
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,233
I want details,
and I want them right now.

147
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,709
I don't have a job,
I have no place to go.

148
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,156
You're not in the mood?
Well, you get in the mood!

149
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,309
All right. Okay.

150
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,152
We were in my apartment,
watching TV.

151
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,878
- Where you sitting?
- On the couch.

152
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,359
- Next to each other?
- Separate.

153
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,919
- Time?
- Around 1 1.

154
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,877
Okay, go ahead.

155
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,189
So she's flipping around the TV...

156
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,794
...and she gets to the naked station.

157
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,590
See, that's why I don't have cable,
because of that naked station.

158
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,832
If I had that in my house,
I would never turn it off.

159
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,792
I wouldn't sleep. I wouldn't eat.

160
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,871
Eventually, firemen would
break through the door.

161
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,794
They'd find me in my pyjamas
with drool coming down my face.

162
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,030
All right, so you're watching
the naked station.

163
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,153
And then...

164
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,835
...somehow we started talking about,
"What if we had sex?"

165
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,470
Boy, these are really bad details.

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,310
It pains me to say this, but I may
be getting too mature for details.

167
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,358
I hate to hear this.

168
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,428
Any kind of growth
really irritates me.

169
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,635
- I'll tell you, it was really passionate.
- Better than before?

170
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,758
She must have taken some kind
of seminar or something.

171
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,232
This is all too much.
So, what are you feeling?

172
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,550
What's going on?
Are you, like, a couple again now?

173
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,109
- Not exactly.
- " Not exactly." What does that mean?

174
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,310
Well, we've tried
to arrange a situation...

175
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,948
...where we'll be able
to do this once in a while...

176
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,348
...and still be friends.

177
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,793
What?

178
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,391
Where are you living?

179
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,359
Are you here?
Are you on this planet?

180
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,193
It's impossible. It can't be done.

181
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,591
Thousands of years, people have tried
to have their cake and eat it too.

182
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,036
So all of a sudden, the two of you
are gonna come along and do it.

183
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,112
Where do you get the ego?

184
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,796
No one can do it. It can't be done.

185
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,030
I think we've worked out a system.

186
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,953
You know what you're like?
You're like a pathetic gambler.

187
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,429
One of these losers in Las Vegas
who keeps thinking...

188
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,830
...he's gonna come up with
a way to win at blackjack.

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,551
No, this is very advanced.
We've designed a set of rules.

190
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,077
That we can maintain the friendship
by avoiding all the relationship pitfalls.

191
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,037
All right, all right. Tell me the rules.

192
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,679
Okay.

193
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,879
No calls the next day.

194
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,315
So you have the sex,
next day, you don't have to call.

195
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,632
That's pretty good.

196
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,156
- Go ahead.
- You ready for the second one?

197
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,834
I have to tell you,
I'm very impressed with the first one.

198
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,430
Spending the night:

199
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,954
Optional.

200
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,358
No. No. You see? You got greedy.

201
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,631
No, that's the rule. It's optional.

202
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,189
I know less about women...

203
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,758
...than anyone in the world.

204
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,550
But the one thing I do know is, they're
not happy if you don't spend the night.

205
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,872
It could be a hot, sweaty room
with no air conditioning...

206
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,191
...and all they have is
a little Army cot this wide.

207
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,396
You're not going anywhere.

208
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,957
- I think you're wrong.
- I hope I am.

209
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,631
- Is this yours or the roommate's?
- Roommate's.

210
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,678
- Would she mind?
- She keeps track of everything.

211
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,400
Well, that's too bad,
because I'm taking it.

212
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,073
Oh, thanks.

213
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,514
Well...

214
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,518
...guess I'll get going.

215
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,992
I got that root canal tomorrow morning.
It'll be easy if I go home.

216
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,354
Fine. Go ahead.

217
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,556
I don't understand.
Is there a problem?

218
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,636
I'm getting the impression
there's a problem.

219
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,310
- Just go.
- I'm having surgery tomorrow.

220
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,916
- Surgery! You're going to the dentist!
- You said it could be very serious.

221
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,316
Okay. So fine, go.

222
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,072
What happened to the rules?
Remember?

223
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,753
Sleeping over was optional.

224
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,639
- It's my house, it's my option!
- It has nothing to do with that!

225
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,678
- Of course it does.
- Hi.

226
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,989
- Hi.
- HI.

227
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,991
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi.

228
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,958
Such a great improv class tonight.

229
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,997
Really?

230
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,513
I had this improv...

231
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,599
...where I pretended...

232
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,433
...I was working in one of those
booths in an amusement park...

233
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,592
...where you shoot water in the clown's
mouth and blow up the balloon.

234
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,196
Tina, could you excuse us
for just one second?

235
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,754
Yeah.

236
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,433
I'll excuse you.

237
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,430
- What are you doing?
- I can't go if you're mad.

238
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,711
I'm not mad.

239
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,108
You seem a little mad.

240
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,431
No, Jerry, I'm fine. Really, it's okay.

241
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,318
So you're okay with everything?

242
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,319
Definitely.

243
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,038
Are you?

244
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,679
Definitely.

245
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,953
Well...

246
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,078
...good night.
- Good ni...

247
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,753
- What are you doing?
- What?

248
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,952
The rules.

249
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,830
Hey, who took my cake?

250
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,716
What about jewellery?
That's a nice birthday gift.

251
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,314
Oh, no, I have to be
very careful here.

252
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,393
I don't want to send the wrong
message. Not after the other night.

253
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,232
- Maybe I'll get her some jewellery.
- No.

254
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,311
You can't get her anything
better than me.

255
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,630
Whatever I spend,
you have to spend half.

256
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,558
What am I supposed to get,
a bazooka?

257
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,076
You don't understand.
I'm in a very delicate position.

258
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,949
Whatever I give her, she'll be bringing
in experts from all over the country...

259
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,997
...to interpret the meaning behind it.

260
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,073
What does she need? Maybe there's
something that she needs.

261
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,553
I think I heard her say something
about a bench.

262
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,313
A bench?

263
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,232
- What kind of a bench?
- I don't know.

264
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,517
- She mentioned a bench.
- What, like at a bus stop?

265
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,429
- I don't know.
- Like a park bench?

266
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,874
I have no idea.

267
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,271
- Who puts a bench in the house?
- Forget the bench!

268
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,080
I got it. You want something nice?
What about a music box?

269
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,278
No, too relationship-y.

270
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,194
I mean, she opens it up, she hears
that " Lara's Theme," I'm dead.

271
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,554
Okay, what about a nice frame...

272
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,995
...with a picture of another guy in it?

273
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,158
The frame says, " I care for you,
but if you want to get serious...

274
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,675
...perhaps you'd be interested
in someone like this."

275
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,074
Nice-looking fellow.

276
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,549
- What about candleholders?
- Too romantic.

277
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,280
- Lingerie?
- Too sexual.

278
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,271
- Waffle maker?
- Too domestic.

279
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,591
Bust of Nelson Rockefeller?

280
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,032
Too gubernatorial.

281
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,552
Let's work on the card.

282
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,637
I had to buy a gift for someone.

283
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,030
The hardest part is that card.
The card is a killer.

284
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,156
I never know what it's
supposed to say.

285
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,630
And it's getting so tough, because
the relationships are so complicated...

286
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,475
...greeting-card companies now
put out cards that are blank...

287
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,232
...on the inside. Nothing.

288
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,630
No message.
It's like the card company says:

289
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,631
"We give up.
You think of something."

290
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,634
You know? " For 7 5 cents,
I don't want to get involved."

291
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,875
- Maybe you won't like it.
- How could I not like it?

292
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,429
- Of course I'll like it.
- You could not like it.

293
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,478
Just the fact that you remembered
means everything.

294
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,914
Of course I remembered.

295
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,674
You reminded me every day
for two months.

296
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,118
Oh, the card.

297
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,390
- Cash?
- What do you think?

298
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,794
You got me cash?

299
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,351
This way, I figure you could go out
and get yourself whatever you want.

300
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,919
No good?

301
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,513
Who are you, my uncle?

302
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,116
Hey. Come on, it's $1 82 there. I don't
think that's anything to sneeze at.

303
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,631
Let me see the card.

304
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,915
"To a wonderful girl, a great pal...

305
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,150
...and more."

306
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,988
Hey.

307
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,758
Elaine, I'm glad you're here. Stay right
here. I'm gonna be right back. Stay.

308
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,993
" Pal"? You think I'm your pal?

309
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,151
I said, "and more."

310
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,632
I am not your pal.

311
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,031
What's wrong with pal?
Why is everybody so down on pal?

312
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,749
- Hey.
- Oh, what is this?

313
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,593
- You got me something?
- Yeah. Yeah, open it.

314
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,231
Kramer!

315
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,272
The bench! You got me
the bench that I wanted!

316
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,352
- That's pretty good, huh?
- Great.

317
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,239
You remember when she mentioned it?
I made a mental note of it.

318
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,312
Well, goody for you.

319
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,835
Yeah. See, I'm very sensitive
about that.

320
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,913
I mean, someone's birthday comes up,
I keep my ears open.

321
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,713
So, what did you get her?

322
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,073
1 82 bucks.

323
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,037
Cash?

324
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,114
You've gotta be kidding.
What kind of gift is that?

325
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,078
That's like something
her uncle would give her.

326
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,793
"Think where man's glory
most begins and ends...

327
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,033
...and say my glory
was I had such a friend."

328
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,991
Yeats.

329
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,076
Oh, Kramer.

330
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,839
Could you excuse us, please?

331
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,228
What?

332
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,674
We're talking.

333
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,752
Oh, the relationship.

334
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,873
You know, we never had
one fight before this deal.

335
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,189
- I know.
- Never.

336
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,749
- Ever.
- We got along beautifully.

337
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,558
- Like clams.
- It was wonderful.

338
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,153
A pleasure.

339
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,553
So I think we should forget the whole
deal and go back to being friends.

340
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,273
I can't do it.

341
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,513
You what?

342
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,751
I can't do that.

343
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,070
You mean, it's:

344
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,511
No this?

345
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,556
No that.

346
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,158
No this or that.

347
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,753
Oh, boy.

348
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,352
What do you want?

349
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,750
This, that and the other.

350
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,677
Oh, sure. Of course. You're entitled.

351
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,354
Who doesn't want this,
that and the other?

352
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,717
You.

353
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,753
Well...

354
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,154
Those birthdays.

355
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,153
I told you, they're relationship killers.

356
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:15,632
If a relationship's having any problems
whatsoever, a birthday brings it out.

357
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,711
I never should have
made up those rules.

358
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,438
What is it about sex that just
disrupts everything?

359
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,318
Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?

360
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,877
It can't be the nudity.

361
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,713
I never got into these terrible fights
and misunderstandings...

362
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,996
...when I was changing
before gym class.

363
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,831
This means I can't see her
anymore either.

364
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,629
- Why?
- It's breakup by association.

365
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,997
Besides, she's mad at me anyway
because of my birthday present.

366
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,312
Why? What did you
wind up giving her?

367
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,031
Ninety-one dollars.

368
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,712
Sorry about that.

369
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,076
So, what are you gonna do?

370
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,629
If I call her, there's no joking around
anymore. This is pretty much it.

371
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,993
So maybe this should be it.

372
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,313
- Could be it.
- She seems like an it.

373
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,675
She's as it as you get.

374
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,475
Imagine bumping into her on the street
in five years with a husband.

375
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,518
And she tells me that he's a sculptor.
They live in Vermont.

376
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,678
We'd have to kill him.

377
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,396
We'd get caught. I'd get the chair.

378
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,394
I'd go to prison as your accomplice.

379
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,474
Have to wear that really
heavy denim.

380
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,836
The cafeteria, with the guy who slops
the mashed potatoes onto your plate.

381
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,989
Go to the bathroom in front
of hundreds of people.

382
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,593
Plus...

383
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,954
...you know what else.

384
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,037
You better call her.

385
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,909
- Hey.
- Hey.

386
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,752
- You got the paper yet?
- Yeah.

387
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,751
Well, where is it?

388
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,551
- Hey, you done with that?
- No.

389
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,029
Well, you're not reading it now.

390
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,596
All right, you can take it,
but I want it back.

391
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,988
Yeah, yeah.

392
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,198
So...

393
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,396
...what are you guys
gonna do today?

394
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,592
This and...

395
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,754
...that.

396
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,196
And the other.

397
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,234
Boy, I really liked the two of you much
better when you weren't a couple.

398
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,515
Why is commitment such
a big problem for a man?

399
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,318
I think that for some reason...

400
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,029
...when a man is driving down
that freeway of life...

401
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,760
...the woman he's involved with
is like an exit.

402
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,639
But he doesn't want to get out.
He wants to keep driving.

403
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,872
The woman is like, " Look.
Gas, food, lodging. That's our exit.

404
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,871
That's everything we need
to be happy.

405
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,952
Get out, here, now!"

406
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,711
But the man focuses
on the sign underneath...

407
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,952
...that says, " Next exit, 27 miles."
And he thinks, " I can make it."

408
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,909
