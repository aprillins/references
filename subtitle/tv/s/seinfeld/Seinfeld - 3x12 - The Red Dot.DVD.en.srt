1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,069
Every mall has a Hoffritz in it.

2
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:08,573
That's got to be a scary place
to work. I don't know how you feel.

3
00:00:08,742 --> 00:00:10,801
Do you want to stand there
having people going:

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,502
"l need knives.
I need more knives.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,671
Do you have any bigger knives?

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,409
I'd like a bigger knife.
A big, long, sharp knife.

7
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,247
That's what I'm in the market for.
I like them really sharp.

8
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,355
Do you have one
with hooks and gouges...

9
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,253
...and blades
that are kind of serrated?

10
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:29,020
That's the kind of knife
I'm looking for.

11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,923
I need one I can throw.
I need one I can hack away with.

12
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,362
Do you have anything like that?"

13
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:46,142
Like you know
what you're talking about.

14
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,540
Oh, no. You do?

15
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:50,981
Well, what do you think,
they put the statue on a giant raft...

16
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,120
...and a tugboat pulled it
all the way from France?

17
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,447
Think they brought it in pieces...

18
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,388
...and screwed it together
like a coffee table?

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,461
What's going on? It's a little early
for a Christmas party.

20
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,394
-Why'd France give that to us anyway?
-lt was a gift.

21
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,295
Countries just exchange gifts
like that?

22
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,663
If they like each other.

23
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,269
-There's Elaine.
-See that guy she's talking with?

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,772
-That's her new boyfriend.
-Really?

25
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:17,773
He works here in the office?

26
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:20,845
They're having a little fling,
so don't say anything to anyone.

27
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:25,682
Who am I going to tell, my mother?
Like I have nothing better to talk about.

28
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:27,581
You don't.

29
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:30,683
He's a recovering alcoholic.

30
00:01:31,057 --> 00:01:33,958
-Really?
-He's been off the wagon two years.

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,090
-"Off the wagon"?
-I think it's "off the wagon."

32
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:39,988
I think it's "on the wagon."

33
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,329
Jerry, George,
what are you doing here?

34
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,368
What am I doing here?

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,101
My God! My watch!
You found my watch.

36
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,745
Keep your hands to yourself
if you know what's good for you.

37
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,175
-Where'd you find it?
-Under the sofa cushion.

38
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,112
-You stopped by just to give it to me?
-It's your Christmas present.

39
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,785
-I thought I'd never find it.
-Today's your lucky day.

40
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,991
No, today is your lucky day.

41
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:10,125
-lt would be my first one.
-You want to work here?

42
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,321
-What?
-Yeah. One of the readers just left.

43
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,490
There's a job opening.

44
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,498
Dick, this is Jerry.
And this is George.

45
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,001
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-ls this the guy?

46
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,100
"The guy"?

47
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,503
-Dick.
-How can you just get it?

48
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:27,612
My boss said to find someone.
I'm in charge.

49
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,805
All you have to do is meet him.
Come on.

50
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,076
-No, come on. Hold my drink.
-Cranberry juice?

51
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:34,652
And vodka. Come on.

52
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:37,879
I got the cranberry juice.

53
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:40,487
So...

54
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,128
-...you're Jerry.
-So...

55
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,127
...I'm Jerry.

56
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,958
So have you ever done
this kind of work before?

57
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:53,469
Well, you know, book reports,
that kind of stuff.

58
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,408
-Who do you read?
-I like Mike Lupica.

59
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:03,147
Mike Lupica?

60
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:06,114
He's a sportswriter
for the Daily News.

61
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,346
-I find him very insightful.
-No, I mean authors.

62
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,621
Well...

63
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:18,423
...a lot of good ones.
Lot of good ones.

64
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,190
I don't even wanna
mention anybody...

65
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,766
...because I'm afraid I'm gonna
leave somebody out.

66
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:25,302
-Name a couple.
-Who do I like?

67
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:30,605
I like Art Vandalay.

68
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:34,906
-Art Vandalay?
-He's an obscure writer.

69
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,914
Beatnik, you know, from the village.

70
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,808
What's he written?

71
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:41,886
Venetian Blinds.

72
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,681
I got news for you.
I'm funnier than you are.

73
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,418
Why don't we get together New Year's,
watch some football?

74
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:51,086
-Where's my drink?
-There. So how'd it go?

75
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,198
I think he's impressed.

76
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,236
No, no, this is just cranberry juice.

77
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,001
I think maybe Dick picked up yours.

78
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:06,168
Dick?

79
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:10,742
He can't drink. He's an alcoholic.
I told you to hold it.

80
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,784
I didn't know you meant hold it.
I thought you meant hold it.

81
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,150
One drink like that,
and he could fall right off the wagon.

82
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,848
Told you.

83
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,432
I never feel comfortable
in the women's department.

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,434
I feel like I'm just a little too close
to trying on a dress.

85
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,768
Do I really have to
buy her something?

86
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,774
The woman got you a job.
Least you could do is buy her a gift.

87
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,536
How about this?

88
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,613
-What is that, cashmere?
-Yeah. She loves cashmere.

89
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,181
Who doesn't like cashmere?

90
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,319
Find me one person that doesn't
like cashmere. It's too expensive.

91
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:51,155
Wow, look at this.
It's $85, marked down from 600.

92
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,890
-Excuse me, miss?
-Yes.

93
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,256
How come this sweater's only $85?

94
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,728
Oh, here. This is why.

95
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,302
-What? I don't see anything.
-See this red dot?

96
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,300
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, it's damaged.

97
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,496
It's not really damaged.

98
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,335
Wow. $85?

99
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,034
There's no exchanges on this.

100
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,978
-Think she'd care about the dot?
-It's hard to say.

101
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,082
I don't think she'd notice.
Can you see it?

102
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,309
-Well, I can see it.
-But you know where it is.

103
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,751
-What do you want me to do, not look?
-Pretend you didn't know it was there.

104
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,720
-Can you see it?
-It's hard to pretend...

105
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:28,918
-...because I know where it is.
-Can't you take an overview?

106
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:30,528
You want me to take an overview?

107
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,358
I see a cheap man
holding a sweater...

108
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:35,865
...trying to get away with something.
That's my overview.

109
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:43,271
-Yeah, so?
-He's acting very strangely.

110
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,673
I think he started drinking again.

111
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,507
-Oh, boy. Can you smell it?
-No, I can't smell it.

112
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,047
If you can't smell it,
then he hasn't been drinking.

113
00:05:51,217 --> 00:05:54,118
-You don't always smell from a drink.
-Yes, you do.

114
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,881
What about one drink?
Would you smell from one drink?

115
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:58,819
Yes, you would.

116
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,058
-I'll prove it.
-How?

117
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,026
-Would you do me a favor?
-Okay.

118
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,689
Would you take a drink,
and let us smell you?

119
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,264
You can smell me without the drink.

120
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,073
No, no.

121
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,800
I suspect that this guy I'm seeing
might be drinking, but I can't smell it.

122
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,503
-Come on.
-Okay. Well, what am I drinking?

123
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,775
I got a bottle of Scotch my uncle
gave me. Hennigan's.

124
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,977
It's been there two years.
I've been using it as a paint thinner.

125
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,917
All right.

126
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:43,866
-I don't smell anything.
-We're too close to the bottle.

127
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,967
-Yeah?
-It's George.

128
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,702
-Come on up.
-That is damn good Scotch.

129
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,439
I could do a commercial
for this stuff.

130
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,543
Boy, that Hennigan
goes down smooth...

131
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:04,781
...and afterwards,
you don't even smell.

132
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,889
That's right, folks. I just had three
shots of Hennigan's, and I don't smell.

133
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,422
Imagine, you can walk around
drunk all day.

134
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,433
That's Hennigan's,
the no-smell, no-tell Scotch.

135
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,605
-Hello, everybody.
-Hey, George, come here.

136
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,299
I'm gonna tell you what I think.

137
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,105
I know you don't care what I think,
but I'm gonna tell you.

138
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:31,040
I think that you are terrific.

139
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,213
That's all.

140
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,514
Thank you.

141
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,726
-Hey, what's that?
-It's an early Christmas present.

142
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,453
-A Christmas present?
-That's right.

143
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,291
-For who?
-For you.

144
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,699
Get out of here.

145
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,094
Say you got a big job interview
and you're nervous.

146
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,262
Throw back a couple of shots
of Hennigan's...

147
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,637
...and you'll be as loose as a goose
and ready to roll in no time.

148
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,870
And because it's odorless,
why, it'll be our little secret.

149
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,039
Kramer.

150
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,478
Yeah. That'll do.

151
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:15,487
Oh, George, this is beautiful.
Is this cashmere?

152
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:19,563
-Of course it's cashmere.
-Oh, I love cashmere.

153
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,996
-Who doesn't?
-Oh, my God.

154
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,363
George, this must have
cost a fortune.

155
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,605
Money.

156
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,400
Jerry, how could you
let him spend so much?

157
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,065
I tried to stop him.

158
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:36,514
I couldn't. He just wants
to make people happy.

159
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:41,047
George, this is one of the nicest
things anyone has ever given me.

160
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,348
Good. Good. Listen, take it off.
You're gonna wear it out already.

161
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,389
It's for special occasions, this thing.

162
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,589
What's that red dot
on your sweater?

163
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,264
-What?
-Listen, take it off.

164
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,631
I'm getting hot just looking at it.

165
00:08:59,805 --> 00:09:02,365
What is this?
It's like a red dot.

166
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,703
What? What red dot?
What are you talking about?

167
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,506
Jerry, come here for a second.
Do you see anything here?

168
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,978
I don't know.

169
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,117
I don't know.

170
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,086
-What don't you know?
-I don't know.

171
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,153
Well, do you see it, or don't you?

172
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:24,219
Say that again.

173
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,231
Do you see it, or don't you?

174
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:32,394
Do I see it or don't l?
That's the question.

175
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,482
Now, what did you ask me again?

176
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,427
You're still here?
You're a dynamo.

177
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,167
-I can't believe I get paid for this.
-God.

178
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,477
I'll see you tomorrow.

179
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,549
-How you doing?
-Hello.

180
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:37,935
You had sex with the cleaning woman
on your desk?

181
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,701
Who are you?
How did you do that?

182
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,205
Hennigan's.

183
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,265
Hennigan's?

184
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:49,505
I was sitting there in the office,
and the cleaning woman comes in.

185
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,617
I've always been attracted
to cleaning women.

186
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:56,810
Cleaning women, chambermaids....

187
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,149
Yeah, chambermaids,
I'm attracted to them too.

188
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,921
-Why is that?
-It's a woman in your room.

189
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:09,133
-So go ahead.
-So...

190
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:14,898
...she starts vacuuming,
back and forth, back and forth...

191
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,406
...her hips swiveling...

192
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,771
...her breasts....

193
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,213
Convulsing?

194
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:26,008
-Convulsing?
-I don't know. I'm trying to help you.

195
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,217
So then I asked her
if she wanted a drink.

196
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:31,447
-You don't drink.
-I couldn't think of anything else to say.

197
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:35,526
-So you started drinking.
-So we started drinking, and....

198
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,993
I don't know if it was the alcohol
or the ammonia...

199
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:41,190
...but the next thing I knew,
she was mopping the floor with me.

200
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,736
-And how was it?
-The sex was okay...

201
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,431
...but I threw up
from the Hennigan's.

202
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:54,010
Good thing the cleaning lady
was there.

203
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,415
Dick was fired.

204
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:04,249
You mean to tell me, I put that drink
six inches over to the right...

205
00:12:04,423 --> 00:12:07,392
-...and this wouldn't have happened?
-You knew he was an alcoholic.

206
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,892
-Why'd you put the drink down?
-What are you saying?

207
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,125
-I'm not saying anything.
-Yes, you are.

208
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:14,732
-What could I be saying?
-You must be saying something.

209
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,731
If I was, I would have said it.

210
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,130
-Say it.
-I said it.

211
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,067
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

212
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,601
It's exhausting being with you.

213
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,707
-Yeah.
-It's George.

214
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,075
-Come on up.
-Hey.

215
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,980
Let me ask you something.

216
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:35,211
Did George buy that sweater
knowing the red dot was on it...

217
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,355
...because it was cheaper?

218
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,017
-Okay. You just gave me the answer.
-No, I didn't.

219
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,595
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
I saw your expression.

220
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,166
I didn't have an expression.
I have a deviated septum.

221
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,132
I have to--

222
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,628
I have to open my mouth
sometimes to breathe.

223
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,640
How much did he save?

224
00:12:57,376 --> 00:13:02,871
Frankly, I am shocked that you
could ask such a question of me.

225
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:06,449
If l-- The only surprise was how
you could even think of that.

226
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,349
That's what you were seeing.

227
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,787
I have to talk to you.

228
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,291
This cleaning woman's
turning the screws on me.

229
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,589
She's pushing for this
whole relationship thing.

230
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,494
She keeps calling me.
She's threatening to go to the boss.

231
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,067
I could lose my job.
I gotta keep her quiet.

232
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,864
Elaine's in the bathroom.
She's wise to the red-dot thing.

233
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,803
She's asking me
all kinds of questions about it.

234
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,806
-Did you tell her anything?
-No.

235
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,345
-You swear?
-I'm not swearing. I don't wanna swear.

236
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:37,777
-Come on, swear.
-No.

237
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,043
-Oh, you told her, didn't you?
-No.

238
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:44,588
Hey, George, did you buy that sweater
knowing the red dot was on it...

239
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,248
...because you could get it
at a discount?

240
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:49,121
What?

241
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:52,026
-Did I what?
-You did, didn't you?

242
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,828
Elaine, I'm shocked.
I'm shocked.

243
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:00,529
Here I go out, in the spirit of the
season and spend all my savings...

244
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:04,335
...to buy you the most beautiful
Christmas sweater I have ever seen...

245
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,172
...to show my appreciation to you
at Christmas...

246
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,110
...and this is the thanks I get
at Christmas.

247
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,718
-Well, Jerry told me that you did.
-You told her?

248
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:17,515
How could you tell her?
What kind of friend are you?

249
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,319
I didn't tell her, you stupid idiot.
She tricked you.

250
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,089
Elaine, you don't understand.

251
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:32,297
I had a 103 temperature
when I bought that sweater.

252
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,268
I was so dizzy, I was seeing
red dots everywhere.

253
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,108
I thought everything in the store
had a red dot on it.

254
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:41,713
I couldn't distinguish one red dot
from the other.

255
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,873
I couldn't afford anything.

256
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,883
I have nothing. I haven't worked
for a really long time.

257
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,487
I mean, look, I have no clothes.

258
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,123
Look at what I'm wearing.

259
00:14:52,291 --> 00:14:54,259
It was just a little red dot.

260
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,690
A little red dot.

261
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:05,832
-This is for you.
-Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me?

262
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,137
Oh, I knew you cared for me.

263
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,299
As you care for me,
which is why it's very important...

264
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:14,571
...that you never breathe a word
to anyone about....

265
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,478
You know? What with
Clarence Thomas and everything.

266
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,919
-Okay. Can I open it now?
-Yes, of course. Go ahead.

267
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,988
My guess is you're gonna
like this very much.

268
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,691
-ls that cashmere?
-Of course it's cashmere.

269
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:34,560
Oh, a cashmere sweater.

270
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,667
Oh, Georgie Porgie.

271
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,928
Just a little something for Christmas.

272
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:46,634
When I was a little girl in Panama,
a rich American came to our town.

273
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:50,475
And he was wearing the softest,
most beautiful sweater.

274
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,517
I said, "What do you call
this beautiful fabric?"

275
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,744
And he said:

276
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:59,857
"They call it cashmere."

277
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:06,356
I repeated the word.
"Cashmere, cashmere"...

278
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:08,693
...and I asked him if I could have it...

279
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:10,625
...and he said:

280
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,135
"No. Get away from me."

281
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,706
And he started to walk away.

282
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,036
Oh, but I grabbed onto his leg...

283
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,202
...screaming for him
to give me the sweater...

284
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,575
...and he dragged me
through the streets.

285
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,979
And then he kicked me
with the other foot...

286
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,551
...and he threw some change at me.

287
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:32,020
But I didn't want the change, Georgie.

288
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,792
I wanted the cashmere.

289
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:42,197
I had a feeling you would like it.

290
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,201
-I'm going to try it on.
-No. Don't try it on now. Try it later.

291
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,431
Oh, look, it fits beautiful.

292
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:51,508
All right, take it off.
You're gonna ruin it.

293
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,908
What's this?

294
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,643
I was in a men's room the other day.

295
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:01,843
They had the hand blower instead of
the paper towels. You know this thing?

296
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,818
I like the hand blower, I have to say.

297
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:07,516
Takes a little bit longer,
but I feel when you're in a room...

298
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:11,356
...with a revolting stench, you want
to spend as much time as you can.

299
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,426
The only stench is coming from you.

300
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh, well, wait a second.

301
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,070
I believe we have a heckler,
ladies and gentlemen.

302
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,968
Dick, I don't know
what your problem is.

303
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,200
It's not my fault
you're back on the wagon.

304
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,401
It's "off the wagon."

305
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:30,173
In the old days, how do you think they
got the alcohol from town to town?

306
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,718
-I don't know.
-On a wagon.

307
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:39,417
Don't you think they broke into a
couple of those bottles along the way?

308
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,059
You can't drink on a wagon.
It's too bumpy.

309
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,752
They had smooth trails.
What about the Cumberland Gap.

310
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,057
What the hell do you know
about wagons?

311
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,826
I know enough not to get on them.

312
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,129
I'm gonna get right to the point.

313
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,442
It's come to my attention
that you and the cleaning woman...

314
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,512
...have engaged in sexual intercourse
on the desk in your office.

315
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,078
Is that correct?

316
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,582
-Who said that?
-She did.

317
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:14,819
Was that wrong?

318
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,754
Should I not have done that?

319
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,830
I got to plead ignorance
on this thing...

320
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,296
...because if anyone
had said anything to me...

321
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:26,495
...when I started here that that
sort of thing was frowned upon....

322
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,771
You know, because I've worked
in a lot of offices...

323
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,343
...and I tell you,
people do that all the time.

324
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,413
You're fired.

325
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,447
Well, you didn't have
to say it like that.

326
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,950
I want you out of here
by the end of the day.

327
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,334
What about the whole Christmas-spirit
thing? Any flexibility there?

328
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,094
No.

329
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,836
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

330
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,967
She wanted me to give you this.

331
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:20,323
You had sex on your desk
with the cleaning woman.

332
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,023
You never had sex
in the office before?

333
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:26,228
No. I once made out with someone,
but that's it.

334
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:28,491
Okay. All right. So you made out.

335
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,999
-Well, that's not sex.
-Kissing is sex.

336
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,338
Kissing is not sex.

337
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,735
-George.
-Jerry.

338
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:40,174
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink
next to Dick's on purpose?

339
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,342
-No.
-George?

340
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,004
Over here.

341
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,014
What are you doing here?

342
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,654
I'm taking the kid out to dinner
to cheer him up.

343
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:52,881
Hey, Jerry, when do you consider sex
has taken place?

344
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,959
I would say...

345
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,289
...when the nipple
makes its first appearance.

346
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:10,103
So George told me that you left
the drink next to Dick's on purpose.

347
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,872
Nice try.

348
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,912
So guess who heckled me
at the club last night.

349
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,386
Merry Christmas!

350
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,751
-Oh, my God, that's Dick.
-Dick?

351
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:28,358
Dick!

352
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,295
It's Cape Fear.

353
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,089
Hide. Hide under the desk.

354
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:38,768
-Move over.
-Get off of me.

355
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:41,770
-I have no room.
-My foot's sticking out.

356
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,067
Shut up. He's coming.

357
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,859
Is that cashmere?

358
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,588
Of course it's cashmere.

359
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:11,096
What's this?

360
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,998
But, in a way, I think I inadvertently
turned this guy into an alcoholic.

361
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,804
I hate being around alcoholics.

362
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:24,506
They're either saying how much they
love you or how much they hate you.

363
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,444
Those are the two statements
that scare me most.

364
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,747
But I think he's okay now because
I don't know how he feels about me.

365
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:34,119
-He's finally off the wagon.
-You mean on the wagon.

366
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,521
Don't get smart.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
