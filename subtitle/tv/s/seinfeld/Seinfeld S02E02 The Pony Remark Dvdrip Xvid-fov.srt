1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,300
My parents live in Florida now.
They moved there last year.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,100
They didn't wanna move to Florida,
but they're in their 60s...

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,500
...and that's the law.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,800
And you know how it works.
They got the leisure police.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,900
They pull up in front of the
old people's house with the golf cart.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,200
"Let's go, pop. White belt, white pants,
white shoes, get in the back.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,500
Drop the snow shovel, right there.
Drop it!"

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,400
I am not much
for the family gathering.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,600
You ever sit there, and the
conversation's so boring, it's so dull?

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,300
And you start to fantasize.
You know, you think:

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,100
"What if I just got up and jumped out
that window? I wonder what..."

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,600
Just crash right through the glass,
you know.

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,900
Come back. There's broken glass.
Everybody's upset.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,600
"No, I'm all right.
I was just a little bored there.

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,300
And, no, I'm fine.
I came back.

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,000
I wanna hear more about
that Hummel collection, Aunt Rose.

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,900
Let's pick it up right there."

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,300
You have so many nice jackets. I don't
know why you had to bring this jacket.

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,800
Who wears a jacket like this?

20
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,000
What's wrong
with that nice grey one?

21
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,500
You have beautiful clothes.
They sit in your closet.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Morty, you can't wear this.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,700
- Are you getting that?
- I thought you were getting it.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,300
- Should I pick up?
- Do you want me to get that?

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,600
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,000
Hello.

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,800
Hello.

28
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,400
- Hi.
- Hi.

29
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,100
Would you make this thing lower?

30
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,000
- I can hear it on the street.
- Hey, Jer, how did you do?

31
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,800
We won.
I made an incredible play in the field.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
It was a tag-up at third base.

33
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,700
I threw the guy out,
from left field, on a fly.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,600
We'll be in the championship game
Wednesday because of me.

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,600
It was the single greatest
moment in my life.

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,200
This is your greatest moment,
a game?

37
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,500
Well, no.
Sharon Besser, of course.

38
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,400
You know what my greatest moment
was, don't you?

39
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,000
In 1946, I went to work
for Harry Flemming...

40
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,100
...and I came up with the idea
for the beltless trench coat.

41
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,400
Jerry, look at this sport jacket.

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,800
Is this a jacket to wear
to an anniversary party?

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,200
Well, the man's an individualist.
He worked for Harry Flemming.

44
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,900
- He knows what he's doing.
- But it's their 50th anniversary.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,900
Your mother doesn't like
my taste in clothing.

46
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,400
I spoke to Manya and Isaac
on the phone today.

47
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
They invited you again.
I think you should go.

48
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,500
First of all,
I made plans with Elaine.

49
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,400
So bring her.

50
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,600
I don't even know them.
What is she, your second cousin?

51
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,600
I mean, I met them
three times in my life.

52
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,900
I don't know her either.

53
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,600
She made me fly from Florida for this,
and then she criticizes my jacket.

54
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,400
At least come and say hello,
have a cup of coffee, then you leave.

55
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,100
How come he gets to leave?

56
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,000
If I wind up sitting next to Uncle Leo,
I am leaving.

57
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,600
He's always grabbing my arm
when he talks to me.

58
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,800
I guess because so many people have
left in the middle of his conversation.

59
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,200
And it's always
about Jeffrey, right?

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,500
Yeah. He talks about him
like he split the atom.

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
The kid works for
the Parks Department.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,400
- Morty, you coming in?
- Oh, yeah. I forgot all about it.

63
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,700
- Hey. How'd you do?
- We won.

64
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,100
- We're in the finals on Wednesday.
- Yeah!

65
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,900
What is this about?

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,500
I'm completely changing
the configuration of the apartment.

67
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,500
You're not gonna believe it when
you see it. Whole new lifestyle.

68
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,700
- What are you doing?
- Levels.

69
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,700
- Levels.
- Yeah.

70
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,900
I'm getting rid of all my furniture,
all of it...

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,300
...and I'm gonna build
these different levels.

72
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,000
You know, with steps.

73
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,300
And it'll all be carpeted.

74
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,500
With a lot of pillows.

75
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,500
You know, like ancient Egypt.

76
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,900
- You drew up plans for this?
- No. No, it's all in my head.

77
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,100
I don't see how you can
get comfortable.

78
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,900
Oh, I'll get comfortable.

79
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,100
When do you intend to do this?

80
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,100
Should be done
by the end of the month.

81
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,600
- Gonna do this yourself?
- It's a simple job.

82
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,100
- Well, you don't think I can, huh?
- No, it's not that I don't think you can.

83
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,600
I know that you can't,
and I'm positive that you won't.

84
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,800
Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows.
All I need is the lumber.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,500
- Hey, that's some big job.
- I don't see it happening.

86
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,400
Yeah, well, this time...
This time you're wrong.

87
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,400
- Come on, I'll even bet you.
- Seriously?

88
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,400
I don't want you betting.
Morty, don't let them bet.

89
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,800
A big dinner with dessert,
but I got till the end of the month.

90
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,700
- I'll give you a year.
- No, no.

91
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,900
- No, no, a month. End of the month.
- It's a bet.

92
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,400
Seriously, do you wanna
switch chairs?

93
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,400
No, no. I'm fine.

94
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh, Jerry, you listening to this?

95
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,100
Yeah, Uncle Leo.

96
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,500
So now the Parks commissioner is
recommending Jeffrey for a citation.

97
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,700
Right, for the reducing
of the pond scum?

98
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,800
No, no, no. For the walking tours.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,700
Oh, yeah, where the people eat
the plant life, the edible-foliage tour.

100
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,100
That's exactly right.

101
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,600
He knows the whole history
of the park.

102
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,600
For two hours, he's talking
and answering questions.

103
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,600
But you wanna know something?

104
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,300
Whenever he has a problem
with a high-powered big shot...

105
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,500
...from the Parks Department...

106
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
...you know who he calls?

107
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,400
Mickey Mantle?

108
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,900
Jerry. Jerry.

109
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,900
Did you taste these peas?

110
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,500
These peas are great.

111
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,100
These peas are bursting
with country-fresh flavour.

112
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,500
Phenomenal peas.

113
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,500
- Are you ready for dessert?
- Well...

114
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,600
...actually, we do have
to kind of get going.

115
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,100
You're going?

116
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,400
- I don't really eat dessert. I'm dieting.
- Yeah, I can't eat dessert either.

117
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,700
The sugar makes my ankles swell up,
and I can't dance.

118
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,100
- Can't dance?
- He's kidding, Manya.

119
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,100
Is that a joke?

120
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,200
So did you hear Claire's
getting married?

121
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,500
Yeah, yeah.

122
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,600
I hear the fellow owns
a couple racehorses.

123
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,100
- You know, trotters, like at Yonkers.
- Horses.

124
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,700
They're like big riding dogs.

125
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,500
What about ponies, huh?
What kind of abnormal animal is that?

126
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,100
And those kids who had
their own ponies.

127
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,700
Oh, I know. I hated those kids.

128
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,600
In fact, I hate anyone that ever had
a pony when they were growing up.

129
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,300
I had a pony.

130
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,600
Well, I didn't really mean
a pony per se.

131
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,800
When I was a little girl in Poland...

132
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,100
...we all had ponies.

133
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,900
My sister had pony.

134
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,900
My cousin had pony.

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,700
- So, what's wrong with that?
- Nothing, nothing at all.

136
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,400
- I was just merely expressing...
- Should we have some coffee?

137
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,900
Who's having coffee?

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,400
He was a beautiful pony,
and I loved him.

139
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,400
Well, I'm sure you did.
Who wouldn't love a pony?

140
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,100
Who wouldn't love a person
that had a pony?

141
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,400
You. You said so.

142
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,800
No, see, we didn't have ponies.

143
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,700
I'm sure at that time in Poland,
they were common. They were...

144
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,400
...probably like compact cars.

145
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,700
That's it.

146
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,000
I had enough.

147
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,000
Have your coffee, everybody.

148
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,900
She's a little upset.
It's been an emotional day.

149
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,400
I didn't know she had a pony.

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,200
How was I to know she had a pony?

151
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,700
Who figures an immigrant
is gonna have a pony?

152
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,400
Do you know what
the odds are on that?

153
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,700
I mean, in all the pictures I saw
of immigrants on boats...

154
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,700
...coming into New York Harbour...

155
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,900
...I never saw one of them
sitting on a pony.

156
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,100
But why would anyone come here
if they had a pony?

157
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,600
Who leaves a country packed with
ponies to go to a non-pony country?

158
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,100
It doesn't make sense.

159
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,500
Am I wrong?

160
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,900
- I'll drive you to the airport.
- No, we're taking a cab.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,600
I just hope that whole pony incident
didn't put a damper on the trip.

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,600
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
It was a misunderstanding.

163
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,400
Hey, I agree with him.

164
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,900
Nobody likes a kid with a pony.

165
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,300
Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm
sorry. Elaine too. She feels terrible.

166
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,200
- You know, you should call Manya.
- Maybe I will.

167
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,600
- Oh, hi. Hey.
- Hey.

168
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,600
I just came to say goodbye.

169
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,100
- Hey, need any help with those?
- It's nothing. I got it.

170
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,500
So how are your levels
coming along?

171
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,900
Well, I decided I'm not gonna do it.

172
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,700
Really? What a shock.

173
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,800
- Goodbye. We'll call you.
- Take care.

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,600
- Bye, Jer.
- Bye, Dad. Take it easy.

175
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,400
- Bye, Mr. Kramer.
- Yeah, so long, Morty.

176
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,300
So...

177
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,700
...when do I get my dinner?

178
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,100
There's no dinner. The bet's off.
I'm not gonna do it.

179
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes, I know you're not gonna do it.
That's why I bet.

180
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,200
Yeah, well, there's no bet
if I'm not doing it.

181
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,500
That's the bet,
that you're not doing it.

182
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,400
Yeah, I could do it.
I don't wanna do it.

183
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,400
We didn't bet on
if you wanted to do it...

184
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,000
...we bet on if it would be done.

185
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,100
- And it could be done.
- Well, of course it could be done.

186
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,900
Anything could be done,
but it only is done if it's done.

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,500
Show me the levels.

188
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,100
- The bet is the levels.
- I don't want the levels.

189
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,700
That's the bet.

190
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,100
Man.

191
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,800
Hello.

192
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,300
No. Oh, hi.

193
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,800
No, they just left.

194
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Oh, my God.

195
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,900
Hang on a second,
maybe I can still catch them.

196
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,800
Ma. Ma, up here.

197
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,600
Don't get in the cab.

198
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
Manya died.

199
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,500
Manya died!

200
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,300
- Who'd you talk to?
- Uncle Leo.

201
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,100
- And when's the funeral?
- I don't know, said he'd call back.

202
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,400
You know what this means?

203
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,100
We lost the supersaver.
Those tickets are nonrefundable.

204
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,700
She just had a checkup.
The doctor said she was fine.

205
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,800
- Unless...
- What?

206
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,600
What? Nothing.

207
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,400
You don't think...?

208
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,800
What, the pony remark?

209
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,400
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
She was an old woman.

210
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,700
You don't think I killed her?

211
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,700
You know what that flight
will cost us?

212
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,700
It was an innocent comment.

213
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,200
I didn't know she had a pony.

214
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,900
Maybe we could get
an Army transport flight.

215
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,300
They got a base in Sarasota, I think.

216
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,500
I mean, the whole thing was taken
out of context. It was a joke.

217
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
That's probably Uncle Leo.

218
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,700
Hello.

219
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,100
Yes, I know.

220
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,200
Well, it's just one of those things.

221
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,700
Sure, sure. We'll see you then.

222
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,200
The funeral's Wednesday.

223
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,500
Wednesday?
What...? What Wednesday?

224
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,000
Two o'clock, Wednesday.

225
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,700
- What?
- I got a softball game on Wednesday.

226
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,000
It's the championship.

227
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,800
So you're not obligated.
Go play in your game.

228
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,100
- I didn't even know the woman.
- So don't go.

229
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,000
I mean, I met her three times.
I don't even know her last name.

230
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
Jerry, no one's forcing you.

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,100
I mean, who has a funeral
on a Wednesday?

232
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,100
That's what I wanna know.
I mean...

233
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,400
...this is the championship.
I'm hitting everything.

234
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't have a dress to wear.
And, you, you don't have anything.

235
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,300
I got my sport jacket.

236
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,900
You're not wearing that to a funeral.

237
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,400
- What's wrong with it?
- It looks ridiculous.

238
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,400
What, I'm gonna buy
a new sport jacket now?

239
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,700
I don't know what to do.

240
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,600
You know what this funeral's gonna
wind up costing me? Oh, boy.

241
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,900
We don't understand death.

242
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,800
And the proof of this is that
we give dead people a pillow.

243
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,600
And, I mean, hey, you know.

244
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,000
I think if you can't stretch out
and get some solid rest at that point...

245
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,300
...I don't see how bedding accessories
really make the difference.

246
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,400
I mean, they got the guy
in a suit, with a pillow.

247
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,900
Now, is he going to a meeting,
or is he catching 40 winks?

248
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,400
I mean, let's make up our mind
where we think they're going.

249
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,200
I actually like ponies.

250
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,100
I was just trying
to make conversation.

251
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,500
- What time is your game?
- 2:45.

252
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,000
- And what time is the funeral?
- Two o'clock.

253
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,000
How long does a funeral take?

254
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,800
Depends on how nice
the person was...

255
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,900
...but you gotta figure
even Oswald took 45 minutes.

256
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,000
So you can't do both.

257
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,400
You know,
if the situation were reversed...

258
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,600
...and Manya had some mahjong
championship or something...

259
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,400
...I wouldn't expect her to go
to my funeral. I would understand.

260
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,200
How can you even consider
not going?

261
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,700
You know, I've been thinking.

262
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,700
I cannot envision
any circumstance...

263
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,000
...in which I'll ever have
the opportunity to have sex again.

264
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,900
How's it gonna happen?

265
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,000
I just don't see how it could occur.

266
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,900
You know, funerals always make me
think about my own mortality...

267
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,000
...and how I'm actually
gonna die someday.

268
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Me, dead.

269
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,800
Imagine that.

270
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,500
They always make me
take stock of my life...

271
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,300
...how I've pretty much wasted all of it
and how I plan to continue wasting it.

272
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,100
I know, then you say to yourself:

273
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,200
"From this moment on,
I'm not gonna waste any more of it."

274
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,800
But then you go, " How?

275
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
I mean, what can I do
that's not wasting it?"

276
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,500
Well, is this a waste of time?
What should we be doing?

277
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,400
- Can't you have coffee with people?
- You know...

278
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,300
You know, I can't believe
you're even considering not playing.

279
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
We need you.
You're hitting everything.

280
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,700
He has to go.
He may have killed her.

281
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,400
Me?

282
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,700
What about you?
You brought up the pony.

283
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:46,400
Oh, yeah, but I didn't say
I hated anyone who had one.

284
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,600
- Who's gonna play left field?
- Bender?

285
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,100
Bender? He can't play left.
He stinks.

286
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,500
I just don't see what purpose
it's gonna serve, you going.

287
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,500
I mean, you think dead people care
who's at their funeral?

288
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,600
They don't even know
they're having a funeral.

289
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,100
It's not like she's in the back going,
"I can't believe Jerry didn't show up."

290
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,100
Maybe she's there in spirit.
How about that?

291
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,300
If you're a spirit, and you can travel
to other dimensions and galaxies...

292
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,700
...and find out the mysteries
of the universe...

293
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,100
...you think she'll be at Drexler's
Funeral Home on Ocean Parkway?

294
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,100
George, I met this woman. She is not
travelling to any other dimensions.

295
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,100
Do you know how easy it is
for dead people to travel?

296
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,200
It's not like getting on a bus.
One second:

297
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,600
It's all mental.

298
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,800
Fifty years they were married.
Now he's moving to Phoenix.

299
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,900
Phoenix? What's happening
with his apartment?

300
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't know. They've been in there
since, like, World War II.

301
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,200
Rent's $300 a month.

302
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,800
Three hundred a month?

303
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,500
Oh, my God.

304
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,000
Although this may seem
like a sad event...

305
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,500
...it should not be a day of mourning...

306
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,400
...for Manya had a rich, fulfilling life.

307
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,200
She grew up in a different world,
a simpler world...

308
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,000
...with loving parents,
a beautiful home in the country.

309
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,100
And from what I understand,
she even had a pony.

310
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,000
Oh, how she loved that pony.

311
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,300
Even in her declining years,
whenever she would speak of it...

312
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,000
...her eyes would light up.

313
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,600
Its lustrous coat, its flowing mane.

314
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,000
It was the pride of Cracow.

315
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,300
Well, game's starting
just about now.

316
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,000
It was good that the two of you came.
It was a nice gesture.

317
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm not a doctor yet, Uncle Morty.
I'm just an intern.

318
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,500
I can't write a note to an airline.

319
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,300
You got your degree. They don't care.
They just wanna see something.

320
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,700
- I just wanted to say how sorry I was.
- Jerry...

321
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,800
...you wanna hear something?

322
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,700
Your cousin Jeffrey
is switching parks.

323
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,600
They're transferring him
to Riverside...

324
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,700
...so he'll completely revamp
that operation, you understand?

325
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
Yeah.

326
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He'll do in Riverside now
what he did in Central Park.

327
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,000
More money.

328
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,400
So...

329
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,600
...that's your cousin.

330
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,500
You don't understand.
I've never paid full fare.

331
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,500
Once again, I just wanted to say
how sorry I am...

332
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,600
...about the other night.
- Oh, me too.

333
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Oh, no, no, no.
She forgot all about that.

334
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,300
She was much more upset
about the potato salad.

335
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,700
So I understand
you're moving to Phoenix.

336
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,500
Yeah. My brother lives there.

337
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,900
I think Manya would've
liked Phoenix.

338
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Gorgeous, exquisite town.

339
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,700
So, what's happening
with your apartment?

340
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,400
Of course...

341
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,100
...it's very hot there.
I'll have to get an air conditioner.

342
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,500
Oh, you can have mine.
I'll ship it out to you.

343
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,500
But what about that big apartment
on West End Avenue?

344
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
Although, they say it's a dry heat.

345
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,300
Dry, wet. What's happening
with your apartment?

346
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,200
I don't even know if I should take
my winter clothing.

347
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
I have an idea.

348
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Leave the winter clothing
in the apartment...

349
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,800
...and I'll watch it for you.

350
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:32,600
And I'll live there, and I'll make sure
that nothing happens to it.

351
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,200
Oh, the apartment.

352
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,100
Jeffrey's taking the apartment.

353
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,900
- Oh, Jeffrey.
- You know Jeffrey.

354
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,300
Yeah, from what I understand,
he works for the Parks Department.

355
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,200
- It's raining.
- It's raining?

356
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,900
It's raining.

357
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,100
The game will be postponed.

358
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,100
We'll play tomorrow.

359
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,200
Believe me,
I wouldn't bother you...

360
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,800
...if the Army hadn't closed
that base in Sarasota.

361
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,300
- Here, scribble a little something here.
- I can't. I'll get in trouble.

362
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Oh, for God's sake.

363
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,600
Who gets picked off in softball?

364
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,600
- It's unheard-of.
- Never happened to me before.

365
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,700
I remember saying to myself,
"Why is Jerry so far off the base?"

366
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,100
I'll have to live with this shame
for the rest of my life.

367
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,300
Look. Then in the fifth inning,
why did you take off on the pop fly?

368
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,600
I thought there were two outs.

369
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,100
I couldn't believe it
when I saw you running.

370
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,900
I thought maybe they had
changed the rules or something.

371
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,000
It was the single worst moment
of my life.

372
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,700
What about Sharon Besser?

373
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,100
Oh, well, of course, 1973.

374
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,600
- Makes you wonder, doesn't it?
- Wonder about what?

375
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,500
You know, the spirit world.

376
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,800
Wait, you think Manya showed up
during the game and put a hex on me?

377
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,400
I never saw anyone play like that.

378
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,400
But I went to the funeral.

379
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,900
Yeah, but that doesn't make up
for killing her.

380
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,500
Maybe Manya missed the funeral...

381
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,000
...because she was off visiting
another galaxy that day.

382
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,000
Don't you think she would've heard
I was there?

383
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Not necessarily.

384
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,000
Who figures an immigrant
is gonna have a pony?

385
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,200
What is the pony?
What is the point of the pony?

386
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,900
Why do we have these animals,
these ponies?

387
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,100
What do we do with them,
besides the pony ride?

388
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,400
Well, why ponies?
What are we doing with them?

389
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,400
I mean, police don't use them for,
you know, crowd control.

390
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,900
"Hey, you wanna get back
behind the barricades?

391
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,600
Hey.

392
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,300
Hey, little boy.

393
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Yeah, I'm talking to you. Just...

394
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,100
Behind the barricades."

395
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,900
So somebody, I assume,
genetically engineered these ponies.

396
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,900
Think they could make them any size?
Like the size of a quarter if they want?

397
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,200
That would be fun for Monopoly,
wouldn't it? Have a little pony.

398
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,700
And you put him on the...

399
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,700
"Baltic, that's two down. Go ahead.
Hold it. There. Baltic, that's...

400
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,900
Yeah, Fine. Right there,
hold it right there."

401
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,800
