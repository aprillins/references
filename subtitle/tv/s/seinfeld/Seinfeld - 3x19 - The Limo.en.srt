1
00:00:02,105 --> 00:00:03,861
Do you think that the people
at the airport...

2
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:06,898
...that run the stores
have any idea...

3
00:00:07,053 --> 00:00:09,770
...what the prices are everyplace else
in the world...

4
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,843
...or do they just feel they have
their own little country out there...

5
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:14,755
...and they can charge
anything they want?

6
00:00:14,917 --> 00:00:17,710
"You hungry? Tuna sandwich is $9.

7
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:20,434
You don't like it,
go back to your own country."

8
00:00:20,633 --> 00:00:22,771
I think the whole
airport-airline complex...

9
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:25,956
...is a huge scam just to sell
the tuna sandwiches.

10
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:29,795
I think that profit is what's supporting
the whole air travel industry.

11
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:32,442
I mean, think about it.
The terminals, the airplanes...

12
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:34,052
...it's all just a distraction...

13
00:00:34,212 --> 00:00:37,158
...so that you don't notice the beating
that you're taking on the tuna.

14
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:45,365
It's all departures.
I see nothing but departures.

15
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:47,438
Do you know where the arrivals are?

16
00:00:50,822 --> 00:00:52,349
Excuse me, sir,
do you have the time?

17
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:54,840
There's a clock over there.

18
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:57,033
- Where?
- Over there.

19
00:00:57,574 --> 00:01:01,174
- But you have a watch on.
- It's right by the escalator.

20
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:03,173
Why not just look at your watch?

21
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:05,620
I told you, it's right over there.

22
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,963
- Let me see the watch.
- Hey!

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,614
What are you, some kind of nut?

24
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,451
You know, we're living in a society!

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,278
- George.
- Jerry, Jerry.

26
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:20,351
The flight was delayed.
How long you been here?

27
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:23,120
I just got here. My car broke down
on the Belt Parkway.

28
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:25,260
I can't believe...
Get rid of that piece of junk.

29
00:01:25,423 --> 00:01:28,140
One mile from the exit,
it starts shaking, violently shaking...

30
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,903
...like it's having
a nervous breakdown.

31
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:32,672
- Then it completely stopped dead.
- So you have no car.

32
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,779
- No.
- So, what good are you?

33
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:39,223
This chauffeur's gonna be
waiting a while.

34
00:01:39,386 --> 00:01:41,371
- O'Brien's not showing up.
- How do you know?

35
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:43,214
He was in Chicago.
Flight was overbooked.

36
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,520
They wouldn't let him on.

37
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,701
He kept screaming how he had
to get to Madison Square Garden.

38
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:49,969
- We should take his limo.
- Yeah, right.

39
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,726
Wait a second. Think about it.

40
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:57,869
He's not showing up.

41
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:00,484
Wait till you see the line for cabs.
It's 45 minutes long.

42
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,322
- You said he's in Chicago.
- He's definitely in Chicago.

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, that guy is just standing there.

44
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:11,026
- How would we do it?
- Just go up and say, "We're O'Brien."

45
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:14,903
- Maybe he knows O'Brien.
- He doesn't know him.

46
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:17,472
If he knew O'Brien,
he wouldn't have a sign.

47
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,464
- Let's just do it.
- What if we get caught?

48
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:23,034
What's gonna happen?
They can't kill us.

49
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:26,753
- Who's gonna be O'Brien?
- I'll be O'Brien.

50
00:02:27,643 --> 00:02:29,901
- Who am I?
- You're you.

51
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,707
- Just me?
- Yeah.

52
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:34,855
- Okay.
- You don't wanna be you?

53
00:02:35,008 --> 00:02:37,768
Well, if you're gonna be O'Brien,
why can't I be somebody?

54
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:41,829
- Like who?
- Dylan Murphy.

55
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:44,673
Okay.

56
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,356
- Now you wanna be Dylan Murphy?
- Well, I like Dylan.

57
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,803
You could be Colin.

58
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,344
Okay. Colin O'Brien.

59
00:02:51,503 --> 00:02:53,641
- I'm Dylan Murphy.
- I'm Colin O'Brien.

60
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:57,215
- Are we really doing this?
- Come on.

61
00:02:57,487 --> 00:03:00,247
- Hey, do you have the time?
- Clock over there.

62
00:03:01,707 --> 00:03:03,004
- O'Brien.
- Yes, sir.

63
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:05,075
Sorry we're late.

64
00:03:05,236 --> 00:03:06,916
- Let me take that for you.
- Oh, thank you.

65
00:03:07,077 --> 00:03:09,870
- I'll bring the car around front.
- Thank you very much.

66
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:12,752
- Dylan.
- Colin.

67
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,119
Can you believe this?
This is incredible.

68
00:03:19,275 --> 00:03:21,490
This is one of the greatest things
I've ever done.

69
00:03:21,654 --> 00:03:23,639
- I'm gonna call my mother.
- What for?

70
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:25,787
To tell her I'm in a limo.

71
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,630
Hello, Ma? It's me.

72
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:32,960
Guess where I am.
In the back of a limo.

73
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:34,694
No, nobody died.

74
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,415
It's a long story. I can't tell you now.

75
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:38,838
Because I can't.

76
00:03:38,992 --> 00:03:40,519
I said, I can't.

77
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:43,318
If I could, I would.

78
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:46,195
Would you stop it? All right, look...

79
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:47,535
I'm getting off.

80
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,646
No, I'm not telling you.
How's this? I'm never telling you.

81
00:03:50,807 --> 00:03:52,837
I don't care. No! Fine!

82
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:54,674
Never!

83
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:59,085
She happy for you?

84
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:02,308
- Can he hear us?
- No.

85
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:03,571
Why?

86
00:04:03,735 --> 00:04:05,764
Thought I saw him look
in the mirror suspiciously.

87
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:07,186
He can't hear us.

88
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:09,066
Let's test him.

89
00:04:10,064 --> 00:04:11,286
Hey, driver.

90
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:13,900
What do you say we stop off,
pick up your sister...

91
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:15,504
...have a little fun back here?

92
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:18,886
No. He can't hear us.

93
00:04:19,577 --> 00:04:22,719
Where's he dropping us? Maybe we
can get him to drop us at my house.

94
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:24,327
I'll ask him.

95
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:28,701
My dear fellow,
where are you dropping us?

96
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,697
At Madison Square Garden, of course.
I have the four passes.

97
00:04:32,428 --> 00:04:34,686
Of course, the four passes.

98
00:04:37,913 --> 00:04:39,823
Four passes to
Madison Square Garden?

99
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:42,084
Wait a minute.

100
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,775
Wait a minute. Of course.

101
00:04:43,936 --> 00:04:45,081
Chicago!

102
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,073
The Knicks are playing
the Bulls tonight!

103
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:49,602
- What?
- We are going to the Knick game!

104
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:51,752
- Michael Jordan!
- The Knicks!

105
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,824
We're going to the game!
Four free passes!

106
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:57,390
- Did I tell you? Did I tell you?
- I can't believe it!

107
00:04:57,554 --> 00:04:59,539
- You may have hit with this one.
- You see?

108
00:04:59,702 --> 00:05:03,454
You see, I see things as they are
and I say, "No."

109
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:07,676
Wait. You see things
as they are not and you say...

110
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:09,820
Wait. You see thing...

111
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:11,476
Do you see things as they are?

112
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:13,159
What do you say
when you see things?

113
00:05:13,857 --> 00:05:15,351
Let me call Elaine and Kramer.

114
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:20,411
If I see things as they are,
I would ask, "Why?" or "Why not?"

115
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,861
Elaine? It's me.

116
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:24,290
What are you doing tonight?

117
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:27,924
Great. George and I have tickets...
Four free passes...

118
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:31,187
...to the Knicks-Bulls game
at Madison Square Garden.

119
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,217
Can you go?

120
00:05:33,382 --> 00:05:36,633
Great. Call Kramer, tell him to meet
us on the corner at 7:00.

121
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:39,818
All right. We're gonna
pick you up in a limo.

122
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,238
That's right, baby doll.

123
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:46,226
And listen, when we pick you up,
I'm Murphy and George is O'Brien.

124
00:05:46,386 --> 00:05:48,415
I can't tell you now. It's a long story.

125
00:05:48,573 --> 00:05:50,143
I am serious.

126
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:52,099
Okay. Okay, bye.

127
00:05:56,935 --> 00:05:59,543
Excuse me, driver,
we have to make a little stop first.

128
00:05:59,697 --> 00:06:00,919
I know.

129
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:05,022
- He knows?
- He knows?

130
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:11,158
Where we going?
Why are we pulling off here?

131
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,662
Maybe it's a shortcut.

132
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:15,271
We're on the Grand Central.
There's no traffic.

133
00:06:16,805 --> 00:06:18,791
Excuse me,
why are we getting off this exit?

134
00:06:18,954 --> 00:06:21,059
To pick up the other members
of your party.

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,782
Right. The other members
of our party.

136
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:27,384
What other members
of our party?

137
00:06:27,546 --> 00:06:29,302
I didn't even know
we were in a party.

138
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:30,762
I'm telling you, the jig is up.

139
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:32,984
It was a bad jig.
We never should've started it.

140
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:36,442
- It was a good jig.
- It was a bad jig. A terrible, terrible jig.

141
00:06:36,599 --> 00:06:39,054
What are we gonna do now?
They'll know you're not O'Brien.

142
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,542
There could be more than one O'Brien
who ordered a limo.

143
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,494
- First, you don't look like any O'Brien.
- You should've been O'Brien.

144
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,717
I don't wanna be Murphy anymore.
Do I have to be?

145
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,597
- Yes, you have to be Murphy.
- It makes no sense, me being Murphy.

146
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:51,022
- You're Murphy.
- I'm Seinfeld.

147
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:52,441
You're Murphy!

148
00:06:53,017 --> 00:06:54,315
Let's just jump out of the car.

149
00:06:54,475 --> 00:06:56,198
We're doing 60 miles an hour.

150
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:58,613
So we jump and roll.
You won't get hurt.

151
00:06:58,771 --> 00:07:00,604
Who are you, Mannix?

152
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:02,103
Why are we slowing down?

153
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:04,287
Are those the people?

154
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:07,822
All right, put your hands up over
your face. Pretend you're sleeping.

155
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,750
- Mr. O'Brien.
- No, I'm Dylan Murphy.

156
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,710
Mr. O'Brien had a long trip.
He's sleeping.

157
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,011
I don't wanna disturb him.

158
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:28,190
We're just really excited to meet him
face-to-face finally.

159
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:31,713
We're faithful readers
of his newsletter.

160
00:07:32,566 --> 00:07:34,901
- Newsletter?
- And, of course, his great book...

161
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,325
...The Big Game.

162
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:40,806
Oh, yes, he's very proud
of his work in The Big Game.

163
00:07:41,581 --> 00:07:44,647
- So you've never met him before?
- No.

164
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:47,561
- Never seen a picture of him?
- Never.

165
00:07:47,872 --> 00:07:49,246
Not even on the book jacket?

166
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:51,704
There was no picture
on the book jacket.

167
00:07:51,862 --> 00:07:54,851
Hey, O'Brien, wake up. Come on.
We got company.

168
00:07:55,007 --> 00:07:56,458
Wake up.

169
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:02,900
Well, hello. I'm O'Brien.

170
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,195
- Hey!
- Hey.

171
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:11,186
You took a cab?

172
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:12,959
Yeah. So?

173
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:14,378
How much do you make?

174
00:08:14,532 --> 00:08:15,830
- I'm not telling you.
- Come on.

175
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,790
- No.
- I'll tell you how much I make.

176
00:08:17,946 --> 00:08:19,365
I know how much you make.

177
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:24,653
I don't even know why I'm doing this.
I don't even like basketball.

178
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:27,840
- You ever seen Michael Jordan?
- Just in those commercials.

179
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:30,789
Maybe you'll see him do
one of those 360 dunks.

180
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:32,364
- What's that?
- It's like this.

181
00:08:32,523 --> 00:08:34,203
- Here, you guard me.
- What?

182
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:47,474
I never get the tinted windows
on the limo.

183
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:48,979
Nobody cares who's in the limo.

184
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:51,424
You see a limo go by,
you know it's either a rich guy...

185
00:08:51,588 --> 00:08:53,464
...or 50 prom kids with $1.75 each.

186
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:58,450
Being in the back of a limo,
I'm sorry, it's just...

187
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:00,866
It's not that cool.
Most of the time, you feel like...

188
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:04,549
...you're in some depressing single
guy's apartment from, like, 1975.

189
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:07,271
All that maroon velour furniture...

190
00:09:07,431 --> 00:09:10,267
...couple of bottles of wine,
three cassette tapes. There's stains.

191
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:13,369
You're counting, there must've been
10,000 asses already on this seat.

192
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:16,860
- I don't think we'll make the tip-off.
- Think someone's been tipped off?

193
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:21,929
So...

194
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:24,114
You've read The Big Game,
have you?

195
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:26,638
Yes, I've read it.
And I've memorized it.

196
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,675
Well, tell me your impressions.

197
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:31,902
I would love to hear what a young
woman thinks of The Big Game.

198
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:34,927
Well, this is sort of embarrassing.

199
00:09:35,434 --> 00:09:37,572
But it's changed my life.

200
00:09:37,735 --> 00:09:39,568
The way you analyse the game...

201
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,559
...the way you identify
the major players...

202
00:09:43,719 --> 00:09:46,086
Well, it left me breathless.

203
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,046
You're a brilliant...

204
00:09:48,207 --> 00:09:50,160
...brilliant man.

205
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:54,110
Well, it's... It's just a game.

206
00:09:54,268 --> 00:09:55,643
Remember that, kids.

207
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,290
"Just a game." He's so humble.

208
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,435
Don't forget what you wrote
in the epilogue:

209
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:04,275
"The fate of the world depends
on the outcome of this game."

210
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:07,349
Well, I was exaggerating a bit.
Just for effect.

211
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:10,798
- He tends to exaggerate.
- I mean, it's serious, but...

212
00:10:10,955 --> 00:10:14,632
We are really looking forward
to your speech tonight.

213
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:17,393
My speech.

214
00:10:17,553 --> 00:10:20,499
Yes, your secretary
faxed me the copy.

215
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:23,648
Would you like to
look it over?

216
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:28,975
Well, you might as well
look it over.

217
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:31,320
So, what's going on?
How did all this happen?

218
00:10:31,478 --> 00:10:33,310
Jerry and George called me
from this limo.

219
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:35,577
They said we're all going
to the Knicks-Bulls game.

220
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:36,837
Limo?

221
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:38,834
I thought that George went
to pick him up.

222
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:40,141
He did.

223
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:42,439
Then why would they take a limo
from the airport?

224
00:10:42,602 --> 00:10:43,704
I don't know.

225
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:46,276
That's pretty strange.

226
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:47,932
Did he say anything else?

227
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:50,346
Yeah. He said it's really important...

228
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:53,832
...that we call them
O'Brien and Murphy.

229
00:10:55,299 --> 00:10:58,168
O'Brien? Why would he
wanna be called O'Brien?

230
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:03,540
"And the Jews steal our money...

231
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,417
...through their
Zionist-occupied government...

232
00:11:06,577 --> 00:11:09,523
...and use the black man
to bring drugs...

233
00:11:09,684 --> 00:11:13,317
...into our oppressed
white minority communities."

234
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:17,159
You're not gonna open with that,
are you?

235
00:11:25,795 --> 00:11:28,206
What was that you said
about the myth of the Holocaust?

236
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:31,582
Said so many things.

237
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:34,035
They're shooting! They're shooting!

238
00:11:34,196 --> 00:11:35,723
All right, get down.

239
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,275
I'm ready to die for you.

240
00:11:48,236 --> 00:11:51,105
Oh, that's really very nice of you,
Eva, thank you.

241
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:53,142
But of course, you know, I would.

242
00:11:53,299 --> 00:11:55,590
I would do anything for you.

243
00:11:56,253 --> 00:11:57,518
Anything.

244
00:11:58,977 --> 00:12:00,809
Nothing to worry about,
it was a flat tire.

245
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:02,576
But rest assured...

246
00:12:02,966 --> 00:12:06,217
...we're prepared to handle anything
that might come up.

247
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:14,971
Nice-looking Luger.

248
00:12:16,852 --> 00:12:18,914
I'm at The Paramount,
adjacent to Madison Square Garden...

249
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,947
...where a growing number of
angry demonstrators...

250
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,249
...gather to protest the first public
appearance of Donald O'Brien...

251
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:28,090
...leader of the Midwestern
regional chapter of the Aryan Union...

252
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:30,612
...and reputed to be their most
charismatic spokesman.

253
00:12:30,777 --> 00:12:34,105
Mr. O'Brien advocates the
violent overthrow of the government.

254
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:37,334
He has openly professed
a deep admiration of Adolf Hitler.

255
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,945
Even David Duke has denounced him
as a dangerous extremist.

256
00:12:40,099 --> 00:12:42,935
There is a full house inside
awaiting his arrival from the airport.

257
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:46,386
Sources tell me he is en route
and should be arriving momentarily.

258
00:12:46,543 --> 00:12:48,910
Police have set up barricades,
but, quite frankly, Bill...

259
00:12:49,075 --> 00:12:52,141
...I don't think they're any match for
the emotional fuse that has been lit.

260
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:55,668
From The Paramount, I'm Jodi
Baskerville. Back to you in the studio.

261
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:57,698
Something's very strange here.

262
00:12:57,859 --> 00:12:59,812
George goes to the airport
to pick up Jerry.

263
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:02,882
They come back in a limo with
four tickets to the basketball game...

264
00:13:03,038 --> 00:13:04,718
...and wanna be called
O'Brien and Murphy.

265
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,631
O'Brien. O'Brien. Why O'Brien?

266
00:13:09,636 --> 00:13:10,781
Elaine?

267
00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:13,162
- Dan.
- Excuse me a minute. Hey.

268
00:13:13,318 --> 00:13:16,569
- Hi, Dan. How are you?
- Good.

269
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:20,066
- Oh, this is Kramer.
- Oh, Kramer.

270
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:23,094
What's going on?

271
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:26,549
We're headed down to protest
this big neo-Nazi rally.

272
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,269
The head of the Aryan Union
is speaking. He's in from Chicago.

273
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,070
- You should come.
- Oh, we can't.

274
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,062
We're going to the Knicks-Bulls game.

275
00:13:34,225 --> 00:13:37,552
Oh, well, that's where the rally is.
At The Paramount, right next door.

276
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:41,010
- Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.
- Yeah, it's really gonna be something.

277
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:43,960
First time he's appeared in public.
No one knows what he looks like.

278
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:46,380
- Who?
- The head of the Aryan Union.

279
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:47,803
O'Brien.

280
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:55,198
What's taking them
so long out there?

281
00:13:56,282 --> 00:13:58,005
Did you see the way
she was looking at me?

282
00:13:58,391 --> 00:14:02,188
- She's a Nazi, George. A Nazi.
- I know, I know.

283
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,174
Kind of a cute Nazi, though.

284
00:14:05,948 --> 00:14:07,323
We gotta make a plan.

285
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:08,977
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

286
00:14:09,132 --> 00:14:12,121
- Let's just make a run for it.
- I can't run. I have a bad hamstring.

287
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:14,187
- How'd that happen?
- I hurt it in a hotel room.

288
00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:16,716
Know how they tuck the covers in
real tight in those rooms?

289
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:19,444
I can't sleep like that.
I tried to kick it out and pulled it.

290
00:14:19,604 --> 00:14:22,746
Why do they make that bed so tight?
You gotta sleep with your feet like that:

291
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:27,540
It's for a mental patient. Wait a minute,
the phone. We'll call the police.

292
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,265
911.

293
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,181
She said she'd do anything.

294
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:35,552
Yeah, hello. Police?
Yeah, listen...

295
00:14:35,716 --> 00:14:37,777
...we're in the back of a limo
in Queens...

296
00:14:38,554 --> 00:14:39,929
AstroTurf?

297
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,036
You know who's
responsible for that, don't you?

298
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:43,879
The Jews!

299
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,062
Oh, the Jews hate grass.
They always have, always will.

300
00:14:47,224 --> 00:14:49,209
We'll be ready in a minute.

301
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:51,019
Would you excuse us a minute,
Tim Boy?

302
00:14:51,175 --> 00:14:52,746
We're in the middle
of something here.

303
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:55,694
With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien,
we're just about to leave.

304
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:03,557
Tim?

305
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:05,628
Who's the head of the Aryan Union?

306
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,623
- You or me?
- You are.

307
00:15:07,785 --> 00:15:10,315
And who is responsible
for making hatemongering...

308
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,077
...and fascism popular again?
- You are.

309
00:15:14,306 --> 00:15:15,833
Okay?

310
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:18,064
I think you forgot something.

311
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:20,403
- I'm sorry.
- Good.

312
00:15:20,597 --> 00:15:21,894
Now get out.

313
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:27,260
- All right, what are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

314
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:30,065
How's this: we wait till we get
to your street corner...

315
00:15:30,225 --> 00:15:32,058
...we see Elaine and Kramer,
then we get out.

316
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,172
- They can't shoot us in the city.
- No.

317
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,130
No one's ever been shot in the city.

318
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:41,187
I'm telling you,
something is going on.

319
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,837
I can feel it, sense it.

320
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:47,555
- I'm sure he was just joking around.
- Oh, no, this is no joke.

321
00:15:47,717 --> 00:15:50,968
O'Brien's coming in from Chicago.
Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien.

322
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:52,396
That's not funny.

323
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,727
Oh, my God.

324
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,329
Yes. Yes!

325
00:16:00,491 --> 00:16:02,095
What? What is it?

326
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:04,132
Don't you see?
There's always been something...

327
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:07,769
...very strange about Jerry.
Always so clean and organized.

328
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,038
- So?
- Do I have to spell it out for you?

329
00:16:10,196 --> 00:16:11,844
The limo? The name?

330
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:14,061
The rally at Madison Square Garden?

331
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,984
Jerry and O'Brien
are the same person.

332
00:16:17,216 --> 00:16:19,627
Jerry is the leader
of the Aryan Union.

333
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:20,931
Jerry's a Nazi?

334
00:16:22,241 --> 00:16:24,194
I can't even believe I didn't see it.

335
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,722
Listen, you idiot, just calm down.

336
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,214
I know Jerry. He's not a Nazi.

337
00:16:30,374 --> 00:16:33,440
- You don't think so?
- No. He's just neat.

338
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:41,492
You know, it's funny.

339
00:16:42,342 --> 00:16:43,684
You don't look like an O'Brien.

340
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,371
Me?

341
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:48,548
Yeah, right. Get a load of this guy.

342
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:53,120
- And you don't look like a Murphy.
- I may not look like one...

343
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:56,570
...but I act like a Murphy.
- He's extremely Murphy. To a fault.

344
00:16:56,957 --> 00:16:58,102
Where are you from?

345
00:16:58,607 --> 00:17:00,559
Dublin. Originally.

346
00:17:00,716 --> 00:17:03,509
Parents came over here
when I was 18.

347
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,815
Cereal famine.

348
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:07,462
Couldn't get a bowl anywhere.
It was bad.

349
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:09,377
'Tis a beautiful country, though.

350
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:12,943
Lush rolling hills. And the peat.

351
00:17:13,107 --> 00:17:14,404
The peat.

352
00:17:15,485 --> 00:17:16,979
Sounds more like Scottish.

353
00:17:17,135 --> 00:17:18,661
We were right on the border.

354
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,466
Maybe he's with the company.

355
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,645
- What?
- The CIA.

356
00:17:24,807 --> 00:17:28,636
Maybe they placed him in there to
infiltrate the organization from within.

357
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:31,087
- What about his comedy act?
- That's the perfect cover.

358
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:32,937
All that time on the road.

359
00:17:33,092 --> 00:17:35,580
Look, Jerry, he's too normal
to be a comedian.

360
00:17:35,739 --> 00:17:37,801
These comedians,
they're sick, neurotic people.

361
00:17:38,271 --> 00:17:40,682
- Well, what about George?
- What about him? He's part of it.

362
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:43,787
His whole personality's a disguise.

363
00:17:43,948 --> 00:17:45,977
There's no real person
can act the way he does.

364
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,585
Elaine, I'm telling you,
they're with the organization.

365
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:50,117
They're all part of it.

366
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,343
He's in there with Helms and Hunt
and Liddy, that whole crowd.

367
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,758
George and Jerry, they probably know
who killed Kennedy.

368
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,335
I bet they were even in on it.

369
00:17:59,714 --> 00:18:01,896
All right, what are we gonna do?
What...?

370
00:18:02,054 --> 00:18:04,694
I'm not gonna let them hurt you.
I'm not gonna...

371
00:18:04,854 --> 00:18:06,535
Kramer, you're hurting me.

372
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,146
Those are our friends
I told you about.

373
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:11,518
- Get off of me!
- We're gonna talk to them. Pull over.

374
00:18:11,682 --> 00:18:13,209
- Get off of me!
- It's all right.

375
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,355
- Get off!
- Hey, O'Brien!

376
00:18:15,518 --> 00:18:16,663
- O'Brien!
- Is that him?

377
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:18,503
- Yeah, that's him!
- Look, there's O'Brien!

378
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,842
No-good Nazi bastard!

379
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:21,271
- Let's get him!
- Get him!

380
00:18:21,426 --> 00:18:22,953
- What do we do?
- Get in the car!

381
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:25,219
- Get in the car!
- What? What?

382
00:18:25,914 --> 00:18:27,092
Come on, hey!

383
00:18:32,167 --> 00:18:35,963
O'Brien. Long time, no see.
How's tricks, Murphy?

384
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:39,990
Why did you call him O'Brien
and him Murphy?

385
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:42,906
No, he was talking to me.
He's cross-eyed.

386
00:18:43,061 --> 00:18:44,588
It could be very confusing.

387
00:18:48,738 --> 00:18:49,840
Yeah?

388
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:52,684
- Eva?
- It's for me.

389
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:55,714
Hello?

390
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:00,469
It's O'Brien.

391
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,695
O'Brien?

392
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:04,307
Well, that's weird.

393
00:19:06,691 --> 00:19:07,836
Who are you?

394
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:11,061
- I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
- I'm George Costanza.

395
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,395
This is a misunderstanding.

396
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,240
His car broke down.
I told him to get...

397
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:16,654
My car started shaking violently
about a mile out.

398
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:19,273
- So he picks me up without a car.
- And there was a line...

399
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:20,648
The limo has just pulled up.

400
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:22,946
It's being surrounded by
a huge crowd of protesters.

401
00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:24,941
This has the makings of
a very ugly scene.

402
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:26,784
I just didn't have
anything to do tonight.

403
00:19:26,945 --> 00:19:28,592
Then the phone rang
and it was Jerry.

404
00:19:28,748 --> 00:19:31,465
We just wanted a ride
into the city.

405
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,916
He was supposed to pick me up,
but he didn't pick me up.

406
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,261
And tonight we were gonna go
to the basketball game...

407
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,482
They're banging on the car,
trying to flip it over.

408
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,591
The police seem unable
or unwilling to control the crowd.

409
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:44,544
I would imagine Mr. O'Brien must be
having some very grave doubts...

410
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:47,116
...if he made the right choice
for his first appearance.

411
00:19:47,276 --> 00:19:49,567
We did not want to
antagonize the Nazis.

412
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,563
We have no intention
of upsetting the Nazis.

413
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:54,180
- I don't have a problem with Nazis.
- Do whatever you want.

414
00:19:54,334 --> 00:19:59,156
- Don't bother us, we won't bother you.
- I don't wanna make a Nazi unhappy.

415
00:19:59,321 --> 00:20:00,739
- I swear. I swear.
- I swear.

416
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:02,998
- I swear.
- I swear.

417
00:20:03,157 --> 00:20:05,448
- Get out!
- Open the door.

418
00:20:05,612 --> 00:20:07,138
Oh, look! Look, it's Dan.

419
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:08,980
- Hi, Dan!
- Elaine?

420
00:20:09,448 --> 00:20:12,131
- Hi! Dan!
- Come on, let's go. Go.

421
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:16,229
I am not O'Brien! I am not O'Brien!

422
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:17,568
I repeat, I am not O'Brien!

423
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:20,646
Ask anyone. Jerry! Jerry!

424
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:23,824
So I was watching this movie
the other night, a World War II movie.

425
00:20:23,986 --> 00:20:25,590
And there was Nazis in the movie.

426
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:28,467
And I noticed that the Nazis
in those movies...

427
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:30,460
...always had, like,
two separate Heils.

428
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:33,077
They had the regular Heil
that they would do...

429
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:36,297
...and when they were around the
offices, they had this casual Heil.

430
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:38,133
Remember that?
They'd come in the office:

431
00:20:38,294 --> 00:20:40,127
"Yeah, Heil, how are you? What's...?

432
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:43,235
Is the kid back with coffee? Come on,
are you finished with the copier?

433
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:45,044
Yeah, world domination, Aryan race.

434
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:47,566
So whose doughnuts are those?
Yeah, Heil. Nice to see you.

435
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:49,225
Can I have one
of those doughnuts?"

436
00:21:32,996 --> 00:21:34,905
