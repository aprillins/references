1
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:04,336
When you ask for the doggy bag
in a restaurant...

2
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:07,244
...there's a sense of failure.

3
00:00:07,415 --> 00:00:11,181
People always whisper it
to the waiter, "Excuse me...

4
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:15,116
...l'm sorry, you're gonna have
to give me the doggy bag.

5
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:17,189
I couldn't make it."

6
00:00:17,658 --> 00:00:20,092
It is embarrassing because
a doggy bag means either...

7
00:00:20,261 --> 00:00:22,729
...you were at a restaurant
when you're not hungry...

8
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:27,800
...or you've chosen the stupidest
way to get dog food that there is.

9
00:00:27,969 --> 00:00:30,335
How about the doggy bag
on a date?

10
00:00:30,504 --> 00:00:32,028
That's a good move for a guy, huh?

11
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:35,573
Let me tell you, if you're a guy and you
ask for the doggy bag on a date...

12
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:39,008
...you might as well have them
just wrap up your genitals too.

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,172
You're not gonna be needing
those for a while either.

14
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:56,357
- Is that bothering you?
- No. Not at all.

15
00:00:57,965 --> 00:00:59,262
It's the BMW.

16
00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:01,458
Oh, could you please hurry?

17
00:01:02,303 --> 00:01:03,930
"Please hurry."

18
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,300
Look at you.
Look what you've become.

19
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:09,136
What? What have I become?
I haven't become anything.

20
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,005
Oh, Carl can't wait a few...

21
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:13,669
...more minutes?
- I don't want to keep him waiting.

22
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:17,045
- He'll like you more.
- That's impossible.

23
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:19,852
Stan, why do you have to
pick your teeth at the table?

24
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:22,717
- Leave me alone.
- It's disgusting.

25
00:01:22,923 --> 00:01:26,051
Yeah, I'm gonna get married
real soon.

26
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:29,162
- So where am I dropping you?
- His place.

27
00:01:29,764 --> 00:01:31,891
Guy's got quite a racket.
I take you to dinner...

28
00:01:32,066 --> 00:01:33,590
...then drop you at his apartment.

29
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:36,328
And he gets the rest of my chicken.

30
00:01:37,672 --> 00:01:39,503
So is tonight the night?

31
00:01:39,674 --> 00:01:41,039
You never know.

32
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:43,267
Baby doll.

33
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,776
Thank you, brother.

34
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:04,822
What, do you smell something?

35
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:07,900
Do I smell something?
What am I, hard of smelling?

36
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,469
- Of course I smell something.
- What is it?

37
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,940
I think its BO.

38
00:02:15,543 --> 00:02:16,908
What?

39
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:21,143
It's BO.
The valet must've had BO.

40
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:24,818
It can't be. Nobody has BO like this.

41
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:28,318
Jerry, its BO.

42
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:30,582
But the whole car smells.

43
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:33,318
- So?
- So when somebody has BO...

44
00:02:33,494 --> 00:02:35,826
...the O usually stays with the B.

45
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:37,930
Once the B leaves,
the O goes with it.

46
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,740
Oh, my God.

47
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:55,139
- I can't believe you ski.
- I'm a great skier.

48
00:02:55,316 --> 00:02:56,613
Yeah, what else?

49
00:02:56,784 --> 00:02:59,753
Let's see. I ski, I fish...

50
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,581
...I pillage, I plunder.

51
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,091
- You pillage and plunder?
- When I travel.

52
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,593
See, finally, finally I get
to meet a man...

53
00:03:09,764 --> 00:03:13,495
...who pillages and plunders.
I'm so lucky.

54
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:28,447
- It should only take a second.
- Yeah, I'm gonna poke around.

55
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:37,252
Hey, what do you know?
Look at that.

56
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:39,824
A lesbian sighting.

57
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:41,552
My lucky day.

58
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:45,062
They're so fascinating. Why is that?

59
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:47,325
Because they don't want us.

60
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:50,003
You gotta respect that.

61
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:52,230
Oh, my God.

62
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:55,534
It's Susan! But what do I do?

63
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:57,638
George?

64
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,607
- Susan. Hi.
- Hi.

65
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:03,941
Oh, boy.

66
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:05,984
What are you doing here?

67
00:04:06,153 --> 00:04:08,348
- Renting a video.
- Right.

68
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:09,784
What do you got there?

69
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:12,585
Oh, some... some stupid movie.

70
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,092
This is Mona.

71
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:17,387
Hi.

72
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:21,330
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Yes. Well...

73
00:04:21,502 --> 00:04:24,232
Well, I'll let you two catch up.

74
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:30,507
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yes.

75
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:32,839
I just haven't seen you
in a long time.

76
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:35,880
And you didn't expect me to be
holding hands with a woman.

77
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,875
Oh, please. Me?

78
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:41,283
Come on, that's great.

79
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,889
Are you kidding?
I think that's fantastic.

80
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:46,049
I've always encouraged
experimentation.

81
00:04:46,227 --> 00:04:50,254
I'm the first guy in the pool.
Who do you think you're talking to?

82
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:53,127
- I know who I'm talking to.
- Of course you do.

83
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:58,199
It's just, you know,
I never knew that...

84
00:04:58,372 --> 00:05:00,567
- I like women?
- There you go.

85
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:04,972
So how long has this
been going on?

86
00:05:06,046 --> 00:05:07,775
Since you and I broke up.

87
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:15,081
So after me, you...

88
00:05:15,256 --> 00:05:16,883
...went that way?

89
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:19,655
Yeah.

90
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:23,160
I think that's fantastic. Good for you.

91
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,628
Nice. That's very nice.

92
00:05:31,138 --> 00:05:32,901
- So, what do you got there?
- I don't...

93
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:37,102
- Rochelle, Rochelle.
- Yeah.

94
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:41,078
It's a foreign movie.
A film is what it is, actually.

95
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:43,716
- A lot of nudity in that, huh?
- No, no, just a tiny bit.

96
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:45,374
It's not even frontal nudity.

97
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:48,282
It's "sidal" nudity.

98
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:50,281
Next.

99
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,183
- That's me.
- Good seeing you, George.

100
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,826
Yes, good to see you too.

101
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:55,586
And good luck with...

102
00:05:55,763 --> 00:05:57,754
With the whole thing there.

103
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,532
What are you returning?

104
00:06:03,904 --> 00:06:05,132
Rochelle, Rochelle.

105
00:06:05,306 --> 00:06:07,433
Oh, Rochelle, Rochelle.
A young girl's strange...

106
00:06:07,608 --> 00:06:10,133
...erotic journey from Milan to Minsk?
- Yeah. Yeah.

107
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:13,072
That'll be $3.49.

108
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,942
Three forty-nine? It says $ 1.49.

109
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:17,845
You didn't rewind it. There's
a $2 charge for not rewinding.

110
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:19,781
But there's no signs here.

111
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:22,821
- This is an outrage.
- Don't give him any money for that.

112
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,891
It'll cost you less to keep it
another day, rewind it...

113
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,723
...and bring it back tomorrow.
Don't give him the satisfaction.

114
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:32,831
I'm not giving you the satisfaction.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,729
I'm gonna watch it again.

116
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:36,764
How could that hurt?

117
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:41,635
So this morning I go down
to the garage to check the car out.

118
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:44,778
I figure by this time,
the odor molecules have had...

119
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:48,039
...at least 12 hours to "de-smellify."
- Right.

120
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:50,445
I open the car door...

121
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:53,108
...like a punch in the face...

122
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,144
...the stench hits me.

123
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:58,519
It's almost as if it had gained strength
throughout the night.

124
00:06:58,692 --> 00:07:01,855
You know, I can think of at least
six known offensive odors...

125
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:05,055
...that I would rather smell
than what's living in your car.

126
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:07,325
- What about skunk?
- I don't mind skunk.

127
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:10,095
- Horse manure?
- I love horse manure.

128
00:07:12,206 --> 00:07:14,333
I've never seen anything like this
in my life.

129
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:16,100
In fact, I went to the car wash...

130
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:19,939
...they want $250 to detail it
and get the smell out.

131
00:07:20,647 --> 00:07:23,172
I'm not paying for that.
That's not my responsibility.

132
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,217
I'm driving to that restaurant,
and demand they pay for it.

133
00:07:26,387 --> 00:07:28,116
Absolutely.

134
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,856
Listen, let me ask you something.

135
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:36,290
When you're with a guy and he
tells you he has to get up early...

136
00:07:36,463 --> 00:07:39,227
...what does that mean?
- It means he's lying.

137
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:46,433
- Why, is that what he told you?
- Yeah. Last night.

138
00:07:46,607 --> 00:07:49,576
Oh, come on. Men have to
get up early sometime.

139
00:07:49,743 --> 00:07:51,802
No. Never.

140
00:07:51,979 --> 00:07:55,938
Jerry, I'm sure I've seen men on
the street early in the morning.

141
00:07:56,116 --> 00:07:58,311
Well, sometimes we do
have to get up early...

142
00:07:58,485 --> 00:08:00,476
...but a man will always
trade sleep for sex.

143
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:03,555
Is it possible I'm not as attractive
as I think I am?

144
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:06,459
Anything's possible.

145
00:08:10,197 --> 00:08:11,664
Yeah.

146
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,199
- What's the matter with you?
- Steinbrenner!

147
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,269
- He's ruining my life.
- Oh, yes.

148
00:08:17,438 --> 00:08:20,134
- Steinbrenner.
- I can't take another season with him.

149
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:22,400
He just traded away
their best prospects...

150
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:26,068
...just like he did with Buhner,
McGee, Drabeck, McGriff.

151
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:27,770
I know the list.

152
00:08:28,615 --> 00:08:30,583
What's that smell?

153
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:32,446
What...? What smell?

154
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,916
You stink.

155
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:41,250
- What do you mean, I stink?
- You stink.

156
00:08:41,428 --> 00:08:43,760
- Why don't you take a shower.
- I showered.

157
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,763
Oh, wait a second.

158
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:48,595
Since I showered, I've been in the car.

159
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:51,397
- So?
- Don't you see what's happening?

160
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,200
It's attached itself to me. It's alive.

161
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:57,901
If it's attached itself to you...

162
00:08:58,212 --> 00:08:59,873
Oh, my God.

163
00:09:00,047 --> 00:09:04,143
That's why Carl said he had to
get up early, because I stink.

164
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:07,147
Jerry, he thinks I have BO. Me.

165
00:09:08,388 --> 00:09:10,117
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

166
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,258
- It's George.
- I'm coming right down.

167
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,257
- All right, what happened?
- What happened?

168
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,658
My car stinks is what happened.

169
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,163
And it's destroying the lives
of everyone in its path.

170
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:26,796
- This is BO?
- Yes.

171
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:28,965
- This is unbelievable BO.
- I know.

172
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:31,941
At the car wash, the guy told me
in 38 years in the business...

173
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:34,740
...he's never smelled anything like it.

174
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:37,884
So let me ask you, do you think
I could've done this?

175
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:40,178
No, no. It's the valet guy.

176
00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:43,414
No, no. I mean, driven Susan
to lesbianism.

177
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,683
Oh, no. That's ridiculous.

178
00:09:45,859 --> 00:09:48,453
What if her experience with me
drove her to it.

179
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,824
Suicide, maybe. Not lesbianism.

180
00:09:50,998 --> 00:09:52,761
The woman she was
"lesbianing" with...

181
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:55,834
...Susan told me she's never
been with a guy.

182
00:09:56,803 --> 00:10:00,933
Oh, this isn't even BO.
This is beyond BO. It's BBO.

183
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:03,906
There should be a BO squad
that patrols the city...

184
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:07,410
...to sniff them out, strip them down
and wash them with a soapy brush.

185
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:12,985
The funny thing is, somehow
I find her more appealing now.

186
00:10:13,187 --> 00:10:15,655
Like, if I knew she was
a lesbian when we went out...

187
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:18,120
...I never would've
broken up with her.

188
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:19,782
Let me see if I understand this.

189
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:23,591
On second thought...

190
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:29,600
Oh, my God, there he is.
That's the guy.

191
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,203
No, thank you. Go back.

192
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:32,668
No, go back.

193
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:34,636
No, back, back.

194
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:37,777
Go back. I got it. I'll park it.

195
00:10:37,945 --> 00:10:40,709
I'll park it. Go back. You go back.

196
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:43,941
Sorry. Thank you.
Thank you, no.

197
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:47,211
What do you mean "stunk up"?

198
00:10:47,387 --> 00:10:49,014
I mean the car stinks.

199
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:50,451
George, does the car stink?

200
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:52,114
- Stinks.
- Stinks.

201
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,556
Well, perhaps you're the one
who has the odor.

202
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:56,753
I've never smelled in my life, buddy.

203
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,058
- Really? Well, I can smell you now.
- That's from the car.

204
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:03,067
Maybe you stunk up the car,
rather than the car stinking up you.

205
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:05,797
Oh, it's the chicken and the egg.

206
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,265
Thank you very much.

207
00:11:08,442 --> 00:11:11,240
Well then, go out and smell the car.
See which smells worse.

208
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:13,845
I don't have time to smell cars.

209
00:11:14,014 --> 00:11:15,743
Forget about smelling the car.

210
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,907
Smell the valet. Go to the source.

211
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:20,815
- You gotta smell the car.
- I'm a busy man.

212
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:22,319
Come on. One whiff.

213
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:25,686
All right. One whiff.

214
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:34,263
All right. I give up. I admit it, it stinks.

215
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:35,662
Now could you let me out?

216
00:11:35,836 --> 00:11:39,067
- Yeah, you'll pay for the cleaning?
- Yes, $50. I'll give you $50.

217
00:11:39,239 --> 00:11:42,436
- Fifty dollars, that's not gonna cover it.
- Whatever you want.

218
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:45,407
- I'll give you whatever you want!
- I want half, 125.

219
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,776
Yes! Yes, 125 is good.
Now could you please open the door!

220
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:51,110
- All right.
- Let me out of here!

221
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:55,353
- Oh, my God.
- What?

222
00:11:55,522 --> 00:11:58,616
The video. Someone stole
the video right out of the car.

223
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:01,818
- Someone stole Rochelle, Rochelle?
- Well, you left the window open.

224
00:12:01,995 --> 00:12:03,326
We had to air out the car.

225
00:12:03,497 --> 00:12:06,261
- You should pay for it.
- I'm not paying for that.

226
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:08,424
They already got my $ 7.

227
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:12,402
Erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.

228
00:12:14,508 --> 00:12:20,743
- The valet had such bad BO?
- Oh, man, just rampant, mutant BO.

229
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:25,146
The O went from the valet's B
to the car to me.

230
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:29,722
It clings to everything.
Jerry thinks it's an entity.

231
00:12:32,092 --> 00:12:34,993
But I showered,
and I shampooed. So...

232
00:12:35,162 --> 00:12:38,029
- That's a relief.
- Yeah.

233
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,496
- What?
- It's still there.

234
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:45,229
No, no, it can't be.
I shampooed. I rinsed.

235
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:47,396
- I repeated.
- It's still there. I smelled it.

236
00:12:47,574 --> 00:12:49,508
I don't smell anything.
Take another smell.

237
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:50,938
- No. No.
- No, here, just...

238
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:52,738
Please!

239
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:55,612
Which movie was that again?

240
00:12:55,782 --> 00:12:57,306
Rochelle, Rochelle.

241
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:59,008
George.

242
00:12:59,186 --> 00:13:00,619
Hey. Thanks for meeting me here.

243
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:04,382
- Yeah, I don't have much time.
- Yeah, listen, I gotta ask you...

244
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,785
...I was a little concerned that...

245
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:11,260
...perhaps I was responsible
in some way for your...

246
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:13,926
...metamorphosis.

247
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:18,030
That'll be $98.

248
00:13:18,205 --> 00:13:19,797
What $98?

249
00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:21,372
That's what I said, $98.

250
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:24,739
How could that piece
of crap cost $98?

251
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:26,902
- George, I really have...
- Do you believe this?

252
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,275
Ninety-eight dollars!

253
00:13:31,551 --> 00:13:32,779
Do you have any cash?

254
00:13:32,953 --> 00:13:34,818
I guess.

255
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:37,957
I need, like, 35. Thanks.

256
00:13:38,492 --> 00:13:40,619
So was it me?

257
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:44,730
Oh, don't be ridiculous. Is that what
you wanted to talk to me about?

258
00:13:44,898 --> 00:13:46,263
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

259
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:49,664
- Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
- Yeah, sure.

260
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:52,303
- I gotta go.
- Listen.

261
00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:54,269
Let me ask you something:

262
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:58,542
If you and Mona were ever
to dance...

263
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:01,610
...how do you decide who leads?

264
00:14:01,982 --> 00:14:04,246
I mean, do you take turns?

265
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:07,251
Do you discuss it beforehand?
How does that work?

266
00:14:07,788 --> 00:14:09,016
You're an idiot.

267
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:14,119
Why? That's a legitimate
sociological question.

268
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:15,522
- I'll see you.
- But...

269
00:14:15,695 --> 00:14:18,220
Oh, and George, by the way...

270
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:21,663
...you stink. You need a bath.

271
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:23,962
It's not me! It's the car!

272
00:14:29,142 --> 00:14:30,973
I didn't think I'd come.

273
00:14:31,144 --> 00:14:32,771
I knew you would.

274
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,242
- Oh, Mona.
- Oh, Kramer.

275
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:43,381
You can give it the executive
treatment. That includes...

276
00:14:43,557 --> 00:14:46,253
...complete deionization
of the entire vehicle.

277
00:14:46,426 --> 00:14:50,624
Where we spray everything
with Ozium-D, let it deionize...

278
00:14:50,797 --> 00:14:54,062
...vacuum the spray out
with a deionizing machine.

279
00:14:54,234 --> 00:14:56,293
Hit it with high-pressure
compressed air...

280
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,303
...and wet-dry vac it to extract
the remaining liquids.

281
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,534
And we top it off with
one of our seven air fresheners.

282
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:07,476
In your case, I would recommend
the jasmine or the potpourri.

283
00:15:08,715 --> 00:15:10,342
Let's do it.

284
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,784
The first thing that we're gonna do...

285
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,152
...is flush the follicles
with the five essential oils.

286
00:15:18,758 --> 00:15:22,319
Then we put you under a vapor
machine, and then a heated cap.

287
00:15:22,496 --> 00:15:24,930
Then we shampoo and shampoo...

288
00:15:25,098 --> 00:15:26,588
...and condition and condition.

289
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:29,896
Then we saturate the hair...

290
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,594
...in diluted vinegar.

291
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:36,538
Two parts vinegar, 10 parts water.
Now, if that doesn't work...

292
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:39,110
...we have one last resort.

293
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,712
Tomato sauce.

294
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:44,643
Tomato sauce?

295
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:02,730
Thanks a lot.

296
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:14,905
Wait a minute.

297
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:17,207
It still smells.

298
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:19,318
It still smells!

299
00:16:22,188 --> 00:16:24,281
It still smells.

300
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,651
It still smells.

301
00:16:27,827 --> 00:16:31,422
- How could it still smell after all that?
- I don't know.

302
00:16:31,598 --> 00:16:34,658
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll tell you what, I'm selling that car.

303
00:16:34,834 --> 00:16:36,961
- You're selling the car?
- You don't understand...

304
00:16:37,137 --> 00:16:39,605
...what I'm up against.
This is a force more powerful...

305
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:41,434
...than anything you can imagine.

306
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:45,168
Even Superman would be helpless
against this kind of stench.

307
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:48,112
And I'll take anything I can get for it.

308
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:49,612
Maybe I'll buy it.

309
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:52,613
Are you crazy?

310
00:16:52,786 --> 00:16:54,720
Don't you understand
what I'm saying to you?

311
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:58,415
This isn't just an odor. You need
a priest to get rid of this thing.

312
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,326
- I still smell.
- You see?

313
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:06,431
You see what I'm saying to you?
It's a presence. It's the beast.

314
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:09,325
All right, let me smell you.

315
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:11,333
Kramer. Kramer!

316
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:14,701
- What's that? What's going on?
- Kramer open up, I know you're there!

317
00:17:14,874 --> 00:17:16,501
- Susan.
- Kramer!

318
00:17:16,676 --> 00:17:19,304
- What is going on?
- You know what's going on?

319
00:17:19,479 --> 00:17:21,674
First, he vomits on me.

320
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:24,646
Then he burns down
my father's cabin.

321
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:27,150
And now he's taken
Mona away from me.

322
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,050
- He stole your girlfriend?
- Yes.

323
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:33,056
She's in love with him.

324
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:36,560
Amazing.

325
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,221
I drive them to lesbianism,
he brings them back.

326
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:50,503
Hello.

327
00:17:50,677 --> 00:17:53,077
- She still there?
- No. She left.

328
00:17:53,246 --> 00:17:57,012
- What is going on? What did you do?
- I don't know, I didn't do anything.

329
00:17:57,183 --> 00:18:01,517
I was in the video store, and I was
practicing my golf swing, you know.

330
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:03,679
You know, with a broom, and...

331
00:18:03,857 --> 00:18:07,884
Yeah. But she saw me take a swing,
and she told me...

332
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:12,725
...that the club is going back too fast.
Well, we started talking.

333
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:16,198
She's a golf teacher. So I went
to a lesson, and, you know...

334
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:18,929
...something happened between us.
She's a golf teacher.

335
00:18:19,105 --> 00:18:23,041
I've struck gold! I've already taken
six strokes off my game.

336
00:18:24,878 --> 00:18:27,745
That's the least of what
you've accomplished.

337
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:31,315
I'm gonna have dinner with her.
Can I borrow your jacket?

338
00:18:31,518 --> 00:18:32,746
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.

339
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:35,888
Wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer.
Hold on a second, I don't get this.

340
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:40,516
This woman has never been
with a man her entire life.

341
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,129
I'm Kramer.

342
00:18:47,734 --> 00:18:50,066
Look, I know what you're
going through.

343
00:18:50,236 --> 00:18:52,796
Women. Who knows what they want?

344
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:56,409
I just don't know what
she sees in Kramer.

345
00:18:56,576 --> 00:19:00,945
Listen, you're beautiful. You're
intelligent. You'll meet other girls.

346
00:19:02,148 --> 00:19:04,378
- You think so?
- Yes, I know so.

347
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:06,644
You happen to be
a very eligible lesbian.

348
00:19:08,588 --> 00:19:11,887
- You're very sweet.
- Hey, I know what I'm talking about.

349
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:14,925
But I gotta be honest with you,
I gotta tell you...

350
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:18,559
...ever since I saw you holding hands
with that woman...

351
00:19:18,898 --> 00:19:20,661
...I can't get you out of my mind.

352
00:19:21,267 --> 00:19:22,666
- Really?
- Yeah.

353
00:19:22,836 --> 00:19:25,396
You're just so hip.

354
00:19:26,773 --> 00:19:28,138
- Oh, my God.
- What?

355
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:32,472
It's Allison. I dated her right after you.
She was obsessed with me.

356
00:19:36,015 --> 00:19:37,676
George?

357
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:40,913
Allison. Hi.

358
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:43,749
- Oh, my God. How are you?
- Good.

359
00:19:43,923 --> 00:19:46,448
You know, you owe me $50.

360
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:49,186
Fifty dollars, right. Right.

361
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:52,798
I don't have it on me right now.
Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.

362
00:19:52,966 --> 00:19:54,866
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

363
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:59,632
That's a beautiful vest.

364
00:20:00,206 --> 00:20:01,537
Thank you.

365
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,543
I don't understand it. I was with her
last night at my apartment.

366
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:12,150
It was very romantic.

367
00:20:12,318 --> 00:20:15,981
With that fake wood wallpaper, the
atmosphere is fabulous in there now.

368
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:17,487
It's like a ski lodge.

369
00:20:17,657 --> 00:20:19,591
- What year did you say this was?
- Ninety.

370
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,092
We're on the couch. I moved to hug
her, next she tells me she's leaving...

371
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,060
...she's got to get up early.

372
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:27,893
- That's strange.
- How many miles you got on this?

373
00:20:28,067 --> 00:20:29,295
Twenty-three thousand.

374
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:30,993
And I was looking good too.

375
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:33,537
I had a nice new shirt on.
I'm wearing your jacket.

376
00:20:34,207 --> 00:20:36,641
Wait a second. My jacket.

377
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,370
I wore that in the car. The beast.

378
00:20:41,247 --> 00:20:43,408
- This wicked funk.
- What?

379
00:20:44,017 --> 00:20:45,917
I can't sell this car.

380
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:51,248
This thing.

381
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:53,415
It's got to be stopped.

382
00:20:53,593 --> 00:20:56,528
- So, what do you want to do?
- Sauce me.

383
00:21:41,574 --> 00:21:43,599
Why do we need BO?

384
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:45,672
What is the function of it?

385
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:48,973
Everything in nature has a reason,
has a purpose, except BO.

386
00:21:49,148 --> 00:21:51,810
It doesn't make any sense.
Do something good...

387
00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:55,113
...hard work, exercise,
you smell very bad.

388
00:21:55,288 --> 00:21:58,689
This is the way the human being
is designed. You move, you stink.

389
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,286
Why can't our bodies help us?

390
00:22:02,462 --> 00:22:06,592
Why can't sweat smell good?
lt'd be a different world, wouldn't it?

391
00:22:06,966 --> 00:22:09,799
Instead of putting your laundry
in the hamper, put it in a vase.

392
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:13,461
Go down to the drug store, pick up
some odorant and perspirant.

393
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,871
Probably have a dirty sock hanging
from the rearview mirror of your car.

394
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:19,409
Then on a special night,
maybe a little underwear...

395
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:21,274
...coming out of your breast pocket.

396
00:22:21,447 --> 00:22:23,938
Just to show her that she's important.
