1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,118
The pilot comes on
with his announcements:

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,192
"I'm going over this.
I'm going over that.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,828
I'm taking a left. I'm bringing it up.
I'm taking it down.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,275
I'm going right. I'm going this way.
Going that way."

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,637
And we're back there,
"Yeah, that's all fine.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,992
Just do whatever the hell you gotta do.
I don't know what the hell is going on."

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,989
Do I bother him? Do I go knocking
on the cockpit door?

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,276
"I'm having the peanuts now.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,197
Just thought you might
like to know what we're doing."

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,471
Thank you. Good night.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,560
- Jerry!
- Hey, hey.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,951
Sally Weaver. Susan Ross' roommate
from college?

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,839
- Hello?
- Right. Oh, I'm sorry.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,072
- Oh, so you saw the show?
- Saw it? I loved it.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,470
And thank you for the free tickets.
You are so funny.

16
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,198
- Oh, thanks.
- No, no, I mean it.

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,715
- You're very funny.
- I believe you.

18
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,472
Well, anyway, let me
show you Memphis.

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,108
- I am taking you out to dinner.
- Oh, I'm sorry, I can't...

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,874
...l'm going straight to the airport.
- Oh, that's too bad.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,669
Susan thought we'd really get along.
I guess because we're both wacko.

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,071
You know what, you have to
give this to them for me. Okay?

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,832
Here, it's a wedding present.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,753
Oh, and Jerry, be careful with it,
okay? Be very careful.

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,394
George, as you may be aware...

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,916
...your mother and I are not
moving to Del Boca Vista, Florida.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,992
- I am aware.
- I was wondering, would it be okay...

28
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,628
...if I turned your room
into a billiard parlor?

29
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,394
A billiard parlor?

30
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,196
Regulation table with a hi-fi,
maybe even a bar.

31
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,874
Give it some real authenticity.

32
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,355
- Well, that's... Elaine.
- Oh, hi, Frank.

33
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,150
- Sit down. Join us, please.
- Actually, I've gotta get to the thing.

34
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,992
The thing's canceled. Sit down.

35
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,998
Okay.

36
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,709
So, Frank, did George
ever show you that photo?

37
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,075
What photo?

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,879
The photo I took in Tuscany
of the man in front of the sign...

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,600
...that said Costanza.
- There's a Costanza in Tuscany?

40
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,435
Did he look like me?
Did you talk to him?

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,353
I didn't talk to anyone. I was just
walking by and saw the sign.

42
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,351
I thought George
might get a kick out of it.

43
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,710
I gotta get that picture.

44
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,553
- It could be my cousin, Carlo.
- Who is that?

45
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,315
When the Costanzas came here,
one brother stayed behind.

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,755
I played with his son every day
until the age of 4...

47
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,992
...when we were separated.
- So you weren't born here?

48
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,232
No. That's why
I could never be president.

49
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,879
It always hurt me.

50
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,669
That's why, even at an early age,
I had no interest in politics.

51
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,798
I refuse to vote. They don't want me,
I don't want them!

52
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,678
I don't know why
you're getting riled up.

53
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,478
There's probably
a million Costanzas...

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,358
Don't bring me down.

55
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,236
- You have another copy of that photo?
- No, I don't.

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,119
- But, well, the Maestro might.
- The Maestro? What Maestro?

57
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,350
He's this guy
that I went to Tuscany with.

58
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,149
He's a great guy, but I just wouldn't
feel comfortable calling him.

59
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,548
Really? Why?

60
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,518
Because he hasn't called me
since we got back.

61
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,549
I spilled wine on this 8-by-10 photo of
one of his favorite Italian opera stars.

62
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,119
Who?

63
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,750
- You know the Three Tenors?
- Yeah, Pavarotti, Domingo...

64
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,309
...and the other guy.
- The other guy.

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,791
Can I take that box for you?

66
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,514
Well, you better not.
I'm supposed to be careful with it.

67
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,750
Then I'll have to put your bag
in the overhead.

68
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,831
Oh, okay.

69
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,278
There we go.

70
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,149
- Oh, look at this.
- What?

71
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,356
I bought a bottle
of barbecue sauce in Memphis.

72
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,999
I think the stewardess broke it...

73
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,152
...when she jammed it in the overhead
because of this stupid thing.

74
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,038
Don't press the panic button.

75
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,476
I'm sure that we can
still salvage some sauce.

76
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,278
I don't care about the sauce.

77
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,193
It came in this funny bottle
and there was a guy on the label...

78
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,635
...looked exactly like Charles Grodin.
- I see.

79
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,598
No, you don't see. Because I'm going
on the show this week...

80
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,591
...and this was gonna be
my bit on the show.

81
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,591
- Why don't you do your material?
- I'm out.

82
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,839
Boy, you better get to work.

83
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,431
Thanks for the tip.

84
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,873
- Hey, buddies.
- Hey. Hey, this is for you.

85
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,110
It's from Susan's roommate, Sally.

86
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,918
Oh, yeah, Sally called Susan.

87
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,356
- Said you guys really hit it off.
- Nobody hit anything off.

88
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,590
She just gave me the box.

89
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,876
- What the hell are you doing?
- Well, I'm salvaging the sauce.

90
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,234
What's the matter with you?

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,158
Hey, hey, hey, come on. Come on.

92
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,550
Jerry, why don't you do a bit
on Styrofoam?

93
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,951
- Like what?
- You know, "What is all this stuff?

94
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,315
Why do we need this stuff?

95
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,189
And why do they make them
so small?"

96
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,632
Where's the punch line?

97
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,191
It's all attitude.

98
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,151
This is certainly a crappy gift.

99
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,673
A doormat?

100
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,671
That's what she had me lug up
from Memphis?

101
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,798
Pretty chintzy, huh?
Considering the money she makes.

102
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,996
She's a big executive
for Federal Express.

103
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,958
Federal Express?

104
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,350
Is she out of her mind?
Why didn't she just ship it?

105
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,035
Look, it's personalized.
"The Costanzas."

106
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,919
No. No, forget it. I don't want it.
Let's just get rid of it.

107
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,991
Maybe your father
would be interested in that.

108
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,720
I doubt it.
You know what he's doing now?

109
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,269
He's putting a pool table
in my old bedroom.

110
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,718
Oh, yeah? Maybe I'll go out there and
knock a few balls around with him.

111
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,997
You know, show him a thing or two.

112
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,559
So, what's your game?
What do you like to play?

113
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,111
- Eight ball.
- No, nothing doing.

114
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,317
Let's you and me
play a game of straight pool.

115
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,551
You like to gamble, Cosmo?

116
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,508
Yeah, now and then.
You know how it is.

117
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,433
- Five dollars a game, huh?
- I'll break.

118
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,238
Okay.

119
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,160
That's it. That's it. Seven.

120
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,238
What's...? What's all this?

121
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,591
Oh, I'm just moving in
some more of my stuff.

122
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,955
More of her stuff.

123
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,118
Oh, I put up my doll collection.

124
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,031
Oh, my God.

125
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,431
- What is that?
- What? What is it?

126
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,958
This doll looks like my mother.

127
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,394
- George, it's a doll.
- I know it's a doll.

128
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,630
But it looks like my mother.

129
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,360
Oh, get out of here.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,991
- Seven, low.
- What's going on in here?

131
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,758
Are you two still playing?
You've been up here three hours.

132
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,639
- We haven't finished the first game.
- First game?

133
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,031
Well, we're still learning
the subtleties of the table.

134
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,555
He knows the Maestro.
He could have the picture.

135
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,917
Oh, forget about it.
It's not your cousin.

136
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,752
You don't know that!

137
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,556
- We gonna go see him, huh?
- As soon as the game is over.

138
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,235
- Oh, boy.
- Eleven, the corner pocket.

139
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,952
What is this thing doing here?

140
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,795
Oh, I used to love to sleep
with my dolls when I was a little girl.

141
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,030
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

142
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,760
- Why?
- I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.

143
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,672
Stop it.

144
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,470
Hey, Elaine, you have to buy this
new electric toothbrush I just got.

145
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,073
- The Oro-Dent.
- Oh, yeah?

146
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,232
Every time you use it, you feel like
you just came from the dentist.

147
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,389
That's dynamite.

148
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,028
Wanna come see me on
The Charles Grodin Show tomorrow?

149
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,668
- Who else is on the show?
- One of the Three Tenors.

150
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,231
- The Three Tenors? Which one?
- It's not Pavarotti, it's not Domingo...

151
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,152
- The other guy?
- Yeah, the other guy.

152
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,356
My God, I can't believe the other guy
is gonna be on the show.

153
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,750
- Why?
- I ruined this autographed picture...

154
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,593
...of him that belonged to the Maestro.
You think I could go?

155
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,716
- I could get his autograph?
- Why not?

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,275
The other guy.

157
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,310
Hey, you look awful.

158
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,471
I'm on no sleep, bro.

159
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,633
- Problem in the bedroom?
- Susan has this doll collection.

160
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,837
One of the dolls looks
exactly like my mother.

161
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,753
She likes to sleep with it.

162
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,034
You were in bed with your mother
last night?

163
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,118
It felt like it.

164
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,117
I tell you, this doll is pretty spooky.

165
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,996
It's really freaking me out, man.

166
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,718
And now I gotta go back out there
and pick up this doormat.

167
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440
- I thought you didn't want the doormat.
- I don't.

168
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,034
Susan wants to have it out
when Sally comes tomorrow.

169
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,079
- Sally?
- Yeah.

170
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,912
Wait a minute.
She's coming to New York?

171
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,594
- Yeah, Susan said you'd be excited.
- Excited?

172
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,955
I'm gonna kill her.
She knew she was coming here...

173
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,588
...and she made me carry that box?
- Who is Sally?

174
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,433
- Susan's college roommate.
- It's her fault that bottle broke...

175
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,670
...that I was gonna give
to Charles Grodin.

176
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,876
Call her and tell her
to bring you another one.

177
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,679
- She'll be delighted to talk to you.
- Oh, I will. Don't worry.

178
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,876
I'll have her bring up
a whole case of the stuff.

179
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,032
It'll be really heavy. Let's see
if she likes sitting on a plane...

180
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,670
...with a big box on her lap.
- That sounds pretty juvenile.

181
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,235
Hey, a dinosaur!

182
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,671
His name was Carlo Costanza.

183
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,637
We played together
every day until I was 4.

184
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,109
If I could look at your photos,
maybe I can recognize him.

185
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,000
Unfortunately, those photographs
are at home.

186
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,311
If you bring them by, maybe we
could interest you in a game of pool.

187
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,477
Frank here,
he's got his own billiard room.

188
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,030
Yes, it's... It's...
What do you call it, Kramer?

189
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,589
- It's a billiard room.
- No.

190
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,193
- The name?
- The billiard...

191
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,999
Not billiard... Not the billiards...
It was...

192
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,513
Come on, already. Come on.

193
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,398
- We call it the...
- The place to be.

194
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,357
The place to be!
Yes, it's the place to be.

195
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,238
Then I shall be there.

196
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,792
Now, gentlemen, if you will excuse me,
I must prepare for the symphony.

197
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,155
- Oh, yeah.
- Right.

198
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,795
My pants.

199
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,997
It's an old conductor's trick
I learned from Leonard Bernstein.

200
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,628
- Really?
- You keep a perfect crease...

201
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,189
...by not sitting in them
before the performance.

202
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,278
That is...

203
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,596
That's good thinking.

204
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,354
You see?

205
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,755
You see?

206
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,872
It doesn't look exactly like her.

207
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,954
Jerry, come on.
If my mother keeps shrinking...

208
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,634
...this is exactly what she's
gonna look like in 10 years.

209
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,836
- Why don't you just get rid of it?
- I tried.

210
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,594
I almost threw it down the incinerator.
But I couldn't do it.

211
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,558
The guilt was too overwhelming.
Susan's so attached to it.

212
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,757
Well, where you going?
Don't take your dolly and go home.

213
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,072
Hi, Elaine.

214
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,154
- Did you see that?
- I'm just glad it's out of here.

215
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,511
- What's that?
- Oh, it's a poster of the Three Tenors.

216
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,471
- Yeah.
- It's Sally.

217
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,312
Did you bring
the barbecue sauce?

218
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,710
- A whole case.
- Excellent.

219
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,389
Did you buy that electric toothbrush
I told you about?

220
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,915
- No.
- How come? I told you, it's fantastic.

221
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,799
- Yeah, I like mine.
- I've had yours.

222
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,191
I'm telling you, this one is 10 times
better. Don't you believe me?

223
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,792
- I don't want it.
- I don't understand.

224
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,350
Why not get something that's better
if I'm telling you it's better?

225
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,239
And it's not a little better.
It's much better.

226
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,474
It doesn't matter to me.

227
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,714
Come in.

228
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,873
Well, here I am.

229
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,429
- Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.
- Hi.

230
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,637
- How was your flight? Uncomfortable?
- The seat next to me was empty...

231
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,995
...so there was no problem at all.

232
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,910
Wait. This isn't the sauce
that I asked for.

233
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,548
That's right.
It's a special gourmet sauce.

234
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,914
The pride of Memphis.

235
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,993
No, I wanted the one with the guy on it
that looks like Charles Grodin.

236
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,674
This is much better.
And frankly, in Memphis...

237
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,991
...we think that other sauce
is kind of a joke.

238
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,720
I know it's a joke.
It's supposed to be a joke.

239
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,553
Now I'm going on The Charles
Grodin Show with nothing.

240
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,836
- Nothing!
- You could just do your material.

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,072
- I don't have any material!
- He's got nothing!

242
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,315
Georgie, don't eat with your hands.

243
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,118
Why do you eat so fast?
You can't even taste it!

244
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,475
Don't tell me how to eat.

245
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,155
Still wearing that shirt?
You've had it for five years already.

246
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,629
Why don't you buy a new shirt?

247
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,515
Because I like this one.

248
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,078
Come on, let's go.

249
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,878
Let's go.

250
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,953
Oh, hi, Deena.

251
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,635
That man should really be
in a sanitarium.

252
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,830
Oh, this is remarkable.
I'm lounging...

253
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,070
...and yet my pants remain
perfectly creased.

254
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,312
It's him. It's Carlo Costanza.

255
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,278
- Come on. Are you sure?
- I'd know him anywhere.

256
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,273
I've seen that man in Tuscany.
Eccentric fellow.

257
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,432
Reputation of being
kind of a village idiot.

258
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,919
I still say we're related.

259
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,753
Oh, I love this piece.

260
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,433
Come on, Frank, it's your shot.

261
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,716
- I can't make anything.
- Because you don't know...

262
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,030
...how to follow through correct.
- Follow through?

263
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,395
Here, let me show you.
Take hold of your stick.

264
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,190
- Yeah, I got it.
- Get down. Bring it back slowly.

265
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,478
It's a little unnatural,
but I think I'm getting the hang of it.

266
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,796
Oh, my God.

267
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,917
I'm such an idiot. I was gonna do
this whole bit on that bottle.

268
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,709
- Now I got nothing to talk about.
- Have you ever considered writing...

269
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,438
...new material?

270
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,191
Maybe if I didn't have so many people
in my apartment all the time...

271
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,918
...l'd be able
to get some work done.

272
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,478
- Me? Are you talking about me?
- No, you're never here.

273
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,517
- That doll was really freaky, wasn't it?
- Yeah, really.

274
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,830
Hey, maybe I could talk about that
on the show.

275
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,992
- What?
- Show the doll. Show a picture...

276
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,948
...of George's mother. It's pretty funny.
I'm gonna call him.

277
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,397
- Hello?
- Hello, Susan, it's Jerry.

278
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,834
Hi, Jerry, it's Sally.

279
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,074
Is George there?

280
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,390
- No, but he should be home soon.
- This is important.

281
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,518
Tell him to meet me at the TV studio
with a picture of his mother...

282
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,797
...and that doll that looks like her.
- Is this for your comedy routine?

283
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,838
- Yes.
- Don't worry, I'm on the case.

284
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,712
I think I'll get some air.

285
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,154
Yeah.

286
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,631
This is no good.

287
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,073
Hey, the baton.

288
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,629
Yeah, I've got a hunch, fat man,
I can't miss. Thirteen, in the side.

289
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,474
Giddyup.

290
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,471
Six, in the corner.

291
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,998
This table's mine.

292
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,675
You know where it's going.

293
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,869
- Hey.
- Hey.

294
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,871
- Is George here?
- Not yet.

295
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,553
The other guy.

296
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,832
It's...

297
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,072
...you. It's really you.

298
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,472
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

299
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,235
Would you mind
signing this poster for me?

300
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,960
- My pleasure.
- Oh, thank you so much.

301
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,758
Here you go.

302
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,709
Thank you so much, Mr. Camaro.

303
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,596
Mr. Casea.

304
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,279
Well, whatever.

305
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,319
I'm gonna take this to the Maestro.

306
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,550
He's playing at
the Queens Convalescent Center.

307
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,315
Yeah, that's a hell of a gig.
Hey, look, I got something for you.

308
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,595
The Oro-Dent.

309
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,795
Thank you.

310
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,638
What...? Why does a toothbrush
come in such a big box?

311
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,394
Well, it's a delicate mechanism,
it needs a lot of packing.

312
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,391
How am I supposed to carry
this thing?

313
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,436
- What are you doing?
- Well, I wanna sit down.

314
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,194
- So?
- It's a trick I just learned from Kramer.

315
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,635
Keeps a crease in the pants.

316
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,792
Madam, you have been
an extremely gracious hostess.

317
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,112
Thank you, Maestro.

318
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,392
- Here, take a look at this.
- Yeah, what is it?

319
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,120
It's Carlo. I found him.

320
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,919
You've been cooped up
in this room too long.

321
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,356
You never support me! Let's see
what George says about this.

322
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,238
Where are my pants?

323
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,157
Oh, beautiful.

324
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,869
- Hey there, Mr. Hairy Legs.
- Where's George?

325
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:09,112
Don't worry, I brought your doll.

326
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,391
No, that's the wrong doll.

327
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,870
Jerry, I saw the doll you were
talking about. Not funny.

328
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,476
This doll is much funnier. Look,
it has a bow tie and a cute little hat.

329
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,392
I think it's a riot.

330
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,793
This is a nightmare.

331
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,836
Well, I'll be watching.
Don't screw up.

332
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,472
Too much sauce.

333
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,309
- My pants!
- Mr. Seinfeld, you're on.

334
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,308
Elaine. What a surprise.

335
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,598
I know you're very busy, but I just
wanted to come by and give you this.

336
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,957
Oh, Oro-Dent, that electric toothbrush.
I've heard so much about it.

337
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,396
No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.
This.

338
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,870
What a sweet gesture.
An autographed poster...

339
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,873
...of my favorite tenor
with those two other guys.

340
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,797
Oh, Elaine, this is magnifico.

341
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,588
I just felt so bad
about what happened in Tuscany...

342
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,876
Maestro, you're on.

343
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,393
Elaine, wait for me
after the concert.

344
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,711
- We'll celebrate.
- Oh, okay.

345
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,352
I wanna know why you took
my doll out of the house.

346
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,590
I just wanted a second opinion.

347
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,599
Take a look at this. Does that
look like my flesh and blood?

348
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,797
- Of course, your mother...
- Oh, stop bothering everybody...

349
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,349
...with that picture. It's ridiculous.

350
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,832
Ridiculous? I'll show you ridiculous!
Come here!

351
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,389
No, Mr. Costanza... No!

352
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,309
There.

353
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,313
Now what have you got
to say for yourself?

354
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,592
I told you it looked like her.

355
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,796
Carlo. It's me, Frank.

356
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,837
I'm your cousin, Frank.
Aren't you Carlo?

357
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,594
Carlo? No.

358
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,478
What do you know?

359
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,872
All right. I guess I was wrong.
