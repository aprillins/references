1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,631
I love when you're in
the middle of a dream...

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,709
...and your alarm goes off, you
incorporate the sound into the dream...

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,438
...so you can keep sleeping.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,239
And you'll make any adjustment
in the dream to do it.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,868
I was with Marie Antoinette
in a dream last night.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,315
She was on the guillotine,
the blade came down...

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,391
...her head fell in the basket,
rolled over...

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,996
...and she started singing
Neil Diamond's "Solitary Man."

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,280
And I thought,
"That is not my alarm going off.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,829
This is actually happening."

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,400
It's June! Hey!

12
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,192
It's June! It's June, June, June!

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,478
It's June! June! June!

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,791
It's June!

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,878
June! June, baby!

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,031
- What?
- The catering hall screwed up.

17
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,270
The wedding is delayed until June.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,637
- It's like a stay of execution.
- Dead man walking.

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,839
This is my lucky day.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,752
Well, one out of 20,000.
That's not bad.

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,798
Yeah. Hey, wait a second.
You know, good news for you too.

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,315
Susan's friend, Hallie,
broke up with her boyfriend.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,754
- She did?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,354
- So? Wheels?
- In motion.

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,670
- The wheels are in motion.
- Beautiful.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,717
Hey, if this works out, forget about it.

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,997
Vacations together, movies together,
dinner together.

28
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,116
It's almost as good
as if I didn't get married.

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,510
Set it up. We can have
dinner at the Friars Club.

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,631
- The Friars Club?
- I'm thinking of joining.

31
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,473
Pat Cooper said he would
put me up for membership.

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,838
Hey. Listen, do me a favor, will you?
I got a hot date tonight with Connie.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,672
Wake me up in 20 minutes,
all right?

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,308
- Catnap?
- No, no, no, no. This is evolutionary.

35
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,313
I've been reading this book
on Leonardo da Vinci.

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,869
See, that means "from Vinci."
Did you know that?

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,234
- Must be some book.
- Yeah.

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,188
Well, it turns out that the master slept
only 20 minutes every three hours.

39
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,237
That works to two and a half
extra days...

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,311
...that I'm awake per week,
every week.

41
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,237
Which means if I live to be 80, I will
have lived the equivalent of 105 years.

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,913
Not to mention how much
you'll accomplish.

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,389
- I got a lot in the hopper.
- Didn't know you had one.

44
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,438
Oh, I got a hopper. A big hopper.

45
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,834
All right, people...

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,037
...l'd like to begin with a hearty
"hail and well met, good fellow"...

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,509
...to Bob Grossberg,
joining us from Business Affairs.

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,989
Thanks. Hi, everybody.

49
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,230
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire
for you, so to speak.

50
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,517
Poor bastard.

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,955
You handle all the fact-checking
and copyediting...

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,314
...for the new catalog.

53
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,154
Could you repeat that?

54
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,628
Why don't you handle
all the copyediting?

55
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,031
- I'm sorry. What?
- Copyediting.

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,398
Never mind.

57
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,788
Elaine, you do it.

58
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,633
Hi, I'm Jerry Seinfeld. Pat Cooper
made a reservation for me.

59
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,519
Yes, Mr. Seinfeld,
but all gentlemen are required...

60
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,591
...to wear jackets
in the dining room.

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,318
Oh, I'm sorry.

62
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,789
How embarrassing
this must be for you.

63
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,359
You just bought your own dinner.

64
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,112
- No problem. Please, follow me.
- Excuse me.

65
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,472
Funny. Isn't he funny? Funny guy.

66
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,718
Friars.

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,755
Hey, not bad.
I kind of like this little thing here.

68
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,558
- It's nice.
- This way, please.

69
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,553
Here we go. Here we go.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,672
Come on.

71
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,400
I'm telling you, I can coach
in the NFL. It's not that hard.

72
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,755
That might be the stupidest thing
you've ever said.

73
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,148
- Get out of here.
- Come on.

74
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,392
No, the stupidest thing was when you
said Steve Kroft from 60 Minutes...

75
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,959
...is the guy from Seals & Croft.

76
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,236
Watch the videos.
I'm telling you, look at them.

77
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,549
Oh, come on.

78
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,511
This is nice.

79
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,111
- Morning.
- Morning?

80
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,271
- Yeah, what time is it?
- Ten-thirty.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,991
See, I got the whole night
ahead of me.

82
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,869
- Boy, that's a nice jacket.
- Oh, I don't believe this.

83
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,395
I forgot to give it back.
It belongs to the Friars Club.

84
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,630
Yeah, I like that crest.

85
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,153
All right.

86
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,514
- Breakfast?
- Oh, yeah.

87
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,352
Most important meal of the day.

88
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,988
- This da Vinci sleep is working?
- I'm percolating, Jerry.

89
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,915
I tell you, I have never felt so fertile.
I'm mossy, Jerry. My brain is mossy.

90
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,274
Listen to this idea:

91
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,000
A restaurant that serves
only peanut butter and jelly.

92
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,152
- What do you call it?
- PB and J's.

93
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,278
- What do you think?
- I think you need more sleep.

94
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,271
So how'd your date
work out with Connie?

95
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,795
I am telling you,
this woman is strange.

96
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,632
She never wants to leave
the apartment.

97
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,791
It's like she doesn't wanna
be seen with me.

98
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,473
- Now you're being ridiculous.
- Yeah.

99
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,712
- No milk?
- Oh, I'll be back.

100
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,792
Jerry?

101
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,029
Hey, Jerry.

102
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,073
Come on, buddy.

103
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,229
Kramer.

104
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,834
- Are you awake?
- Why? What time is it?

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,638
- It's 4.
- Four in the morning?

106
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,994
Yeah.

107
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,469
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm bored.

108
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,552
All this free time, I don't know what
to do. You wanna do something?

109
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,109
No. Would you just get out?

110
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,635
- Well, you wanna rent a movie?
- No.

111
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,791
Well, what am I gonna do?

112
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,038
- Ready for lunch?
- I'm stuck here...

113
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,556
...editing the stupid catalog
because of stupid Bob Grossberg.

114
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,632
Listen, there's something
really suspicious about this guy.

115
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,917
Every time Mr. Peterman
tries to assign him any work...

116
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,719
...he says he can't hear.
And it all gets dumped on me.

117
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,518
- You think he's faking?
- I don't know.

118
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,750
I'd like to try that earpiece,
see if it's real.

119
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,478
Hey, Elaine.

120
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,949
Oh, you have a friend.

121
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,119
Just wanted to say hi.

122
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,236
Bob, you know what?

123
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,870
I'm kind of swamped here. Could you
give me a hand with the catalog?

124
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,749
- I'm sorry. What?
- I'm kind of swamped.

125
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,156
Thank you.

126
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,990
I'm having lunch with Mr. P.

127
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,671
I better get going.

128
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,314
Did you see that?
Did you see that, Jerry?

129
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,674
- That was him?
- Yes.

130
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,116
- Somehow I thought he'd be taller.
- All right. Listen.

131
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,635
We'll have to do this some other time.
I got work to do.

132
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,279
- See you later.
- All right.

133
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,678
Hey, Bob.

134
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,232
Bob?

135
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,509
Hey, Bobby, over here.

136
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,193
Bob?

137
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,271
Oh, Bob?

138
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,552
Bob?

139
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,838
Hey.

140
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,598
- Elaine.
- Hi.

141
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,159
I was just in the bathroom.

142
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,550
Okay, Jerry, please, please.
I'm really busy here.

143
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,472
No, no. I was in the bathroom
with Bob.

144
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,234
- So what?
- No, I kind of tried to test his hearing.

145
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,436
Get out! What did you do?

146
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,637
I snuck up behind him at the urinal,
tried to see if he could hear me.

147
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,274
- And?
- Well, he flinched sort of.

148
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,032
What do you mean, sort of?
What did he do?

149
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,270
Well, he kind of moved his head,
you know?

150
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,317
But it might have been
on the zip-up.

151
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,274
- So you don't know anything?
- Actually, no.

152
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,113
- All right. Good job.
- Right.

153
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,559
Come in.

154
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,272
Last night, huh? Was that something
or was that something?

155
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,476
- That was something.
- She's great, isn't she?

156
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,392
Fantastic. Fantastic woman.

157
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,994
- I told you.
- I'm nuts about her.

158
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,718
Do you think she could be an it?

159
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,832
- She could be.
- We might have an it!

160
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,516
- "lt" written all over her.
- She's got everything.

161
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,148
She's intelligent, smart,
got a great sense of humor.

162
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,880
- I don't know. I didn't really talk to her.
- She's smart.

163
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,429
- You take my word for it.
- Whatever.

164
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,272
We could be like the Gatsbys.

165
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,749
Didn't they always have
a bunch of people around...

166
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,911
...and they were all best friends?

167
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,911
- That doesn't sound right.
- No.

168
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,548
Tonight she's got tickets
for that show she's working on...

169
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,280
...The Flying Sandos Brothers.
- Flying Sandos, beautiful.

170
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,634
Great, 7:30, all right?

171
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,472
- Walk me down to the Friars.
- Sure.

172
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,155
So, Jerry, there's an empty apartment
in my building.

173
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,278
If you and Hallie want,
we could try to hold it maybe.

174
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,758
- It's not here.
- What?

175
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,911
The jacket. It's not here.
It's gotta be here.

176
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,110
Oh, boy.

177
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,840
Thanks for that 4 a.m.
wake-up call last night.

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,592
Where the hell is that jacket?

179
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,790
- Oh, the one with the crest?
- Yeah.

180
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,793
- That's at the cleaner's.
- The cleaner's? How did it get there?

181
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,439
Well, I borrowed it last night...

182
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,750
...and it got a little dirty.
- Great.

183
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,993
Somehow I dozed off
and woke up in a pile of garbage.

184
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,755
Somehow? You've had an hour
and 20 minutes sleep in three days.

185
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,230
Well, so look, the cleaner's said
you could pick it up tonight at 6.

186
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,233
All right. I just hope I can get it
to the Friars before the show.

187
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,470
Won't be a problem,
don't worry about it.

188
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,358
Hey.

189
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,434
- Hey!
- Watch out, boy.

190
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,631
Can you give us a hand
with some of these boxes, Bob?

191
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,832
Bob?

192
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,032
I want you so bad, Bob.

193
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,909
You turn me on so much.

194
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,672
You're so damn sexy.

195
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,869
I'm starting to unbutton.

196
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,718
Anything getting through? Bob?

197
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,070
- They perform all over. Europe mostly.
- European tours.

198
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,878
- Sorry. Sorry I'm late.
- Hey, Jerry.

199
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,395
- You're wearing the jacket?
- It wasn't ready on time.

200
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,120
- I have to return it after the show.
- Sure, sure, sure.

201
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,635
How about these seats?
Are these fantastic, huh?

202
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,074
I feel like Lincoln.

203
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,595
Well, let's hope this evening
turns out a little better.

204
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,511
So are you sure you don't
wanna go to the movies?

205
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,274
No, Cosmo. I like
just being here with you.

206
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,271
Well, it's...

207
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,154
It's a bold adventure, huh?

208
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,397
This is risky business, huh?

209
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,152
I'm all atwitter.

210
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,397
How would you kind people like
to lend me a hand with our next trick?

211
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,597
- I don't think so.
- Please, take off your jacket.

212
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,591
- My jacket?
- Yes, the jacket.

213
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,479
What do you say,
ladies and gentlemen?

214
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,834
You can't argue with that.

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,989
- Come on.
- Do it.

216
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,993
- Come on, Jerry. Do it!
- Give him the jacket. Go ahead.

217
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,276
All right.

218
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,949
And now we say
the magic word:

219
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,678
And we make it disappear.

220
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,030
Oh, Cosmo.

221
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,758
Cosmo.

222
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,797
Oh, Cosmo.

223
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,756
Honey, can you move a little?
This hurts.

224
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,950
Cosmo?

225
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,077
Oh, my God. Cosmo, wake up.

226
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,431
Cosmo?

227
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,910
Oh, my God. He's dead.

228
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,911
He's dead.

229
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,478
Yeah, Tommy, this is Connie.
You gotta help me.

230
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,279
Some guy dropped dead
on top of me.

231
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,069
I can't call the cops
because Joey might find out.

232
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,589
I can't. I'm stuck.
You gotta help me.

233
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,997
This is very exciting.
The inner sanctum here.

234
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,514
Hi, I was in the audience earlier.
You threw my jacket.

235
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,319
- I just wanted to pick it up.
- Jacket?

236
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,755
- What jacket?
- I had a jacket with a crest on it.

237
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,911
You came into the audience,
you threw it away.

238
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,193
Are you sure it was me?

239
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,239
- It was you or one of your brothers.
- Well, two of them have left already.

240
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,519
- No.
- It doesn't even belong to me.

241
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,990
- It belongs to the Friars Club.
- Sorry.

242
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,719
- Jerry, I'm sure it'll turn up.
- I'm sure it won't.

243
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,711
Don't worry. I'll get the jacket back.

244
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,996
There you go.
She's gonna get the jacket back.

245
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,151
So let's go get some coffee, huh?

246
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,552
- I'm a little tired. I think I'll go home.
- Oh, that's too bad.

247
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,994
Yeah, we'll do it another time.

248
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,311
George, we'll go.

249
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,030
Broke a shoelace today.

250
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,679
I can get you shoelaces tomorrow.

251
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,519
Okay.

252
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,271
So, what color?

253
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,032
Brown.

254
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,319
Maybe a black.

255
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,995
- More coffee?
- No, check. Please.

256
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,712
That nut is always up to something.

257
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,033
Hey! Hey!

258
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,510
Mama!

259
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,397
No!

260
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,959
Help!

261
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,633
Help!

262
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,230
Elaine, I think I've been working you
a little too hard lately.

263
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,512
So I have two tickets for you to The
Flying Sandos Brothers magic show.

264
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,750
It is a real hoot.

265
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,673
- Well, thank you, Mr. Peterman.
- The tickets are for tonight...

266
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,958
...so you and Bob can knock off
a little early so you both can get ready.

267
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,798
Mr. Peterman, you...

268
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,916
There's no need to deny it, Elaine.

269
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,150
I heard every word you said.

270
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,274
And I know you wouldn't be
just having fun with his handicap.

271
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,998
That kind of cruelty
would be grounds for dismissal.

272
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,396
Of course, Mr. Peterman.

273
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,189
Tell him I'll come down
and talk to him. Okay. Bye.

274
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,913
Well, that was the Friars Club.

275
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,878
Think they're gonna let
a jacket stealer join? I don't think so.

276
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,031
They're gonna charge me
$800 for the jacket...

277
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,713
...and I gotta deal with Pat Cooper.

278
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,791
What kind of show
is that Sandos Brothers?

279
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,431
They take your jacket and just
throw it? I never heard of that.

280
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,352
It was a little unusual.

281
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,671
So Susan and I were thinking dinner
at our house Saturday night.

282
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,434
- Just the four of us.
- No, I don't think so.

283
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,679
- Why not?
- I don't know. I'm a little turned off.

284
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,311
Come on,
what are you talking about?

285
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,471
I'm... I'm kind of soured.

286
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,119
- You're soured?
- Yeah, I'm soured.

287
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,111
- Don't be soured.
- I'm sorry. I'm soured.

288
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,032
Are you kidding?
We were getting along.

289
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,428
Where is this coming from?

290
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,160
Frankly, I didn't think she was
concerned about my jacket.

291
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,754
What are you talking about?
She's very concerned.

292
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,957
- She said she was gonna get it back.
- Yeah, we'll see.

293
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,634
If she gets it back, then you'll have
no reason to be sour.

294
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,119
You'll de-sour, right?

295
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,190
- I'll try and de-sour.
- That's not good enough.

296
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,749
You don't try and de-sour.
You have to sweeten too.

297
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,559
I'll try. I'll try and de-sour
and sweeten.

298
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,310
I wanna get it back
to when we were the Gatsbys.

299
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,072
- I still don't know what that means.
- Yeah.

300
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,719
God.

301
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,316
- Oh, my God, what happened to you?
- She tried to kill me, Jerry.

302
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,119
- Who?
- Connie!

303
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,555
- What did she do?
- I don't know.

304
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,792
But I woke up
in the Hudson River in a sack!

305
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,037
I think she drugged me. But she's
a murderer, and I'm calling the cops.

306
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,553
Why would she try and kill you?

307
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,679
Well, isn't it obvious? She doesn't
want anybody else to have me.

308
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,279
- Hey, there's Uncle Miltie.
- Yeah, it is.

309
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,714
And there's David Steinberg.

310
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,758
- The comedian or the manager?
- The manager.

311
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,839
Hey, there's Pat. Hey, Pat.

312
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,116
What went wrong?
What's the matter with you?

313
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,192
- What, are you a kleptomaniac?
- I forgot to take it off.

314
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,839
You forgot to take it off?

315
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,039
Oh, you go into a department store,
you put a suit on and walk right out.

316
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,236
- What, are you some sort of an idiot?
- I'm sorry.

317
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,630
- Where's the jacket?
- One of the Gypsies took it.

318
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,028
Oh, the Gypsies took it.

319
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,111
Of course,
New York has a lot of Gypsies.

320
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,192
- On every block, there's a Gypsy.
- Well, it's true. I saw it.

321
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,749
Excuse me, are you an entertainer?

322
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,354
- Are you in show business?
- No, l...

323
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,512
Then what am I talking to you for?
Bring the jacket back tomorrow.

324
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,272
All right.

325
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,789
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Look at that guy.

326
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,520
Isn't that guy from the show?
He's wearing the jacket.

327
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,839
- Oh, my God. You're right.
- Come on.

328
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,639
Wait a second.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

329
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,756
- Are you members?
- I'm a prospective member.

330
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,150
Until then, that's the way out.

331
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,833
- That guy has my jacket.
- Let's go.

332
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,230
Excuse me. The guy is wearing
a jacket that my...

333
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,389
- Come on.
- Let's go.

334
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,039
- lf I could talk to the guy...
- Hey!

335
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,915
These seats are fantastic.

336
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,548
It was nice of Mr. Peterman
to give us these tickets.

337
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,314
Yeah. Yeah, it was nice.

338
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,432
Yeah...

339
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,676
...we got our own little private box
here, don't we?

340
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,752
Get off of me. Stop it.

341
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,798
Stop it. Get off of me!

342
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,113
Get ahold of yourself!
Bob, get ahold of yourself!

343
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,391
I don't know how that guy
gave us the slip.

344
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,879
He probably went out the back.

345
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,517
Hey, it's you.

346
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,638
- That's my Friars Club jacket.
- No, it is not. This is my jacket.

347
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,997
No, no, that's my jacket. Give it back.
Come on. I need this jacket.

348
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,114
I wanna join.
I need it to become a member.

349
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,633
Help! Help!

350
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,476
What is he yelling about?
They're stealing.

351
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,312
I can't believe it.

352
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,550
- Hey, George, you know what?
- What?

353
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,188
I think this crest is different.

354
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,357
It's got a moose on it.

355
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,993
- Moose?
- Yeah.

356
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,557
- I don't think this is the jacket.
- No, it's not.

357
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,234
This is the jacket.

358
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,313
She got the jacket back. Thank you.

359
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,995
It got dirty, so they wanted to clean it
before they gave it back to you.

360
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,878
- That's nice of them.
- That is nice.

361
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,917
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

362
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,833
Let's call Susan.
We'll go have coffee.

363
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,396
I'll see you at the wedding.

364
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,432
Great. Now she's sour.

365
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,068
- Maybe she'll sweeten.
- She won't sweeten. And I'm bitter.

366
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,432
There they are!

367
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,556
Here. Here, we'll leave it
there for you.

368
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,594
That's her, officer.

369
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,478
Kramer. Oh, my God.
I thought you were...

370
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,313
What, sleeping with the fishes?
I guess I woke up.

371
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,517
You're under arrest for the
attempted murder of Cosmo Kramer.

372
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,636
- I didn't do anything.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

373
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,837
- Get your coat. We gotta take you in.
- Can I call my lawyer?

374
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,877
Okay. Go ahead.

375
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,996
Meet me at the police station. They're
arresting me for attempted murder.

376
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,197
- Attempted murder? Of who?
- This guy, Kramer.

377
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,635
- Cosmo Kramer?
- Yeah, that's right.

378
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,109
I don't want nothing to do with it.
