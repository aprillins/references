1
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:03,942
Every mall has a Hoffritz in it.

2
00:00:05,447 --> 00:00:08,262
That's got to be a scary place
to work. I don't know how you feel.

3
00:00:08,423 --> 00:00:10,397
Do you want to stand there
having people going:

4
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:12,989
''I need knives.
I need more knives.

5
00:00:13,158 --> 00:00:15,068
Do you have any bigger knives?

6
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:17,694
Id like a bigger knife.
A big, long, sharp knife.

7
00:00:17,862 --> 00:00:20,415
That's what Im in the market for.
I like them really sharp.

8
00:00:20,582 --> 00:00:22,437
Do you have one
with hooks and gouges...

9
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:25,217
...and blades
that are kind of serrated?

10
00:00:25,382 --> 00:00:27,869
That's the kind of knife
Im looking for.

11
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,653
I need one I can throw.
I need one I can hack away with.

12
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,993
Do you have anything like that?''

13
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:44,290
Like you know
what you're talking about.

14
00:00:44,453 --> 00:00:45,631
Oh, no. You do?

15
00:00:46,182 --> 00:00:48,931
Well, what do you think,
they put the statue on a giant raft...

16
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:51,940
...and a tugboat pulled it
all the way from France?

17
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,131
Think they brought it in pieces...

18
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:57,951
...and screwed it together
like a coffee table?

19
00:00:58,117 --> 00:01:00,899
What's going on? It's a little early
for a Christmas party.

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,711
-Why'd France give that to us anyway?
-It was a gift.

21
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:05,535
Countries just exchange gifts
like that?

22
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,805
lf they like each other.

23
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:10,305
-There's Elaine.
-See that guy she's talking with?

24
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:12,705
-That's her new boyfriend.
-Really?

25
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,625
He works here in the office?

26
00:01:14,789 --> 00:01:17,571
They're having a little fling,
so don't say anything to anyone.

27
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,209
Who am I going to tell, my mother?
Like I have nothing better to talk about.

28
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:24,029
You don't.

29
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,005
He's a recovering alcoholic.

30
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:30,146
-Really?
-He's been off the wagon two years.

31
00:01:30,532 --> 00:01:33,150
-''Off the wagon''?
-I think it's ''off the wagon.''

32
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:35,929
I think it's ''on the wagon.''

33
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:39,133
Jerry, George,
what are you doing here?

34
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,087
What am I doing here?

35
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:46,585
My God! My watch!
You found my watch.

36
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:49,122
Keep your hands to yourself
if you know what's good for you.

37
00:01:49,347 --> 00:01:51,452
-Where'd you find it?
-Under the sofa cushion.

38
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:55,228
-You stopped by just to give it to me?
-Its your Christmas present.

39
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:59,708
-I thought Id never find it.
-Today's your lucky day.

40
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:01,825
No, today is your lucky day.

41
00:02:02,146 --> 00:02:04,829
-It would be my first one.
-You want to work here?

42
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:06,936
-What?
-Yeah. One of the readers just left.

43
00:02:07,106 --> 00:02:09,015
There's a job opening.

44
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:10,942
Dick, this is Jerry.
And this is George.

45
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:13,342
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Is this the guy?

46
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,355
''The guy''?

47
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,578
-Dick.
-How can you just get it?

48
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:21,600
My boss said to find someone.
Im in charge.

49
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:23,703
All you have to do is meet him.
Come on.

50
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:25,880
-No, come on. Hold my drink.
-Cranberry juice?

51
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:28,351
And vodka. Come on.

52
00:02:29,057 --> 00:02:31,446
I got the cranberry juice.

53
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:33,947
So...

54
00:02:34,113 --> 00:02:36,480
-...you're Jerry.
-So...

55
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,396
...Im Jerry.

56
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:41,112
So have you ever done
this kind of work before?

57
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:46,397
Well, you know, book reports,
that kind of stuff.

58
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:53,052
-Who do you read?
-I like Mike Lupica.

59
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:55,678
Mike Lupica?

60
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:58,523
He's a sportswriter
for the <i>Daily News</i>.

61
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,622
-I find him very insightful.
-No, I mean authors.

62
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:06,682
Well...

63
00:03:06,848 --> 00:03:10,328
...a lot of good ones.
Lot of good ones.

64
00:03:10,495 --> 00:03:12,022
I don't even wanna
mention anybody...

65
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,493
...because Im afraid Im gonna
leave somebody out.

66
00:03:14,655 --> 00:03:16,924
-Name a couple.
-Who do I like?

67
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:22,010
I like Art Vandalay.

68
00:03:23,134 --> 00:03:26,134
-Art Vandalay?
-He's an obscure writer.

69
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:29,020
Beatnik, you know, from the village.

70
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,836
What's he written?

71
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:32,828
<i>Venetian Blinds</i>.

72
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:36,468
I got news for you.
Im funnier than you are.

73
00:03:36,638 --> 00:03:39,093
Why don't we get together New Year's,
watch some football?

74
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:41,651
-Where's my drink?
-There. So how'd it go?

75
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,676
I think he's impressed.

76
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:48,508
No, no, this is just cranberry juice.

77
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:54,036
I think maybe Dick picked up yours.

78
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:56,114
Dick?

79
00:03:56,573 --> 00:04:00,501
He can't drink. He's an alcoholic.
I told you to hold it.

80
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:03,418
I didn't know you meant hold it.
I thought you meant hold it.

81
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:07,606
One drink like that,
and he could fall right off the wagon.

82
00:04:07,773 --> 00:04:09,235
Told you.

83
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:16,508
I never feel comfortable
in the women's department.

84
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:20,345
I feel like Im just a little too close
to trying on a dress.

85
00:04:20,892 --> 00:04:22,583
Do I really have to
buy her something?

86
00:04:22,748 --> 00:04:26,425
The woman got you a job.
Least you could do is buy her a gift.

87
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:28,114
How about this?

88
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:31,066
-What is that, cashmere?
-Yeah. She loves cashmere.

89
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:32,570
Who doesn't like cashmere?

90
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,579
Find me one person that doesn't
like cashmere. Its too expensive.

91
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:39,257
Wow, look at this.
Its $85, marked down from 600.

92
00:04:41,595 --> 00:04:42,839
-Excuse me, miss?
-Yes.

93
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:45,108
How come this sweater's only $85?

94
00:04:45,275 --> 00:04:47,478
Oh, here. This is why.

95
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:50,906
-What? I don't see anything.
-See this red dot?

96
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:52,823
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, it's damaged.

97
00:04:52,987 --> 00:04:54,929
Its not really damaged.

98
00:04:55,099 --> 00:04:56,692
Wow. $85?

99
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:59,280
There's no exchanges on this.

100
00:04:59,834 --> 00:05:02,103
-Think she'd care about the dot?
-Its hard to say.

101
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,121
I don't think she'd notice.
Can you see it?

102
00:05:04,282 --> 00:05:06,257
-Well, I can see it.
-But you know where it is.

103
00:05:06,426 --> 00:05:10,517
-What do you want me to do, not look?
-Pretend you didn't know it was there.

104
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:12,406
-Can you see it?
-Its hard to pretend...

105
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,472
-...because I know where it is.
-Can't you take an overview?

106
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:17,016
You want me to take an overview?

107
00:05:17,178 --> 00:05:18,771
I see a cheap man
holding a sweater...

108
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:22,134
...trying to get away with something.
That's my overview.

109
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:29,236
-Yeah, so?
-He's acting very strangely.

110
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:31,540
I think he started drinking again.

111
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,258
-Oh, boy. Can you smell it?
-No, I can't smell it.

112
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:36,694
lf you can't smell it,
then he hasn't been drinking.

113
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:39,639
-You don't always smell from a drink.
-Yes, you do.

114
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:42,288
What about one drink?
Would you smell from one drink?

115
00:05:42,457 --> 00:05:44,148
Yes, you would.

116
00:05:46,968 --> 00:05:48,212
-Ill prove it.
-How?

117
00:05:48,377 --> 00:05:50,100
-Would you do me a favor?
-Okay.

118
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:52,653
Would you take a drink,
and let us smell you?

119
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:56,082
You can smell me without the drink.

120
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:58,775
No, no.

121
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:03,309
I suspect that this guy Im seeing
might be drinking, but I can't smell it.

122
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,902
-Come on.
-Okay. Well, what am I drinking?

123
00:06:06,071 --> 00:06:09,039
I got a bottle of Scotch my uncle
gave me. Hennigan's.

124
00:06:09,207 --> 00:06:12,109
Its been there two years.
Ive been using it as a paint thinner.

125
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:18,766
All right.

126
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,347
-I don't smell anything.
-We're too close to the bottle.

127
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:31,281
-Yeah?
-<i>It's George.

128
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:34,862
-Come on up.
-That is damn good Scotch.

129
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,445
I could do a commercial
for this stuff.

130
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,299
Boy, that Hennigan
goes down smooth...

131
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,405
...and afterwards,
you don't even smell.

132
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:52,303
That's right, folks. I just had three
shots of Hennigan's, and I don't smell.

133
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,691
Imagine, you can walk around
drunk all day.

134
00:06:55,862 --> 00:06:59,539
That's Hennigan's,
the no-smell, no-tell Scotch.

135
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:03,539
-Hello, everybody.
-Hey, George, come here.

136
00:07:03,702 --> 00:07:06,123
Im gonna tell you what I think.

137
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,813
I know you don't care what I think,
but Im gonna tell you.

138
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:12,588
I think that you are terrific.

139
00:07:13,012 --> 00:07:14,671
That's all.

140
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,795
Thank you.

141
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:23,794
-Hey, what's that?
-Its an early Christmas present.

142
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:25,451
-A Christmas present?
-That's right.

143
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,213
-For who?
-For you.

144
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,523
Get out of here.

145
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:32,777
Say you got a big job interview
and you're nervous.

146
00:07:32,948 --> 00:07:34,858
Throw back a couple of shots
of Hennigan's...

147
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:38,094
...and you'll be as loose as a goose
and ready to roll in no time.

148
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,195
And because it's odorless,
why, it'll be our little secret.

149
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:45,192
Kramer.

150
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:48,490
Yeah. That'll do.

151
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:55,211
Oh, George, this is beautiful.
Is this cashmere?

152
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,121
-Of course it's cashmere.
-Oh, I love cashmere.

153
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:01,454
-Who doesn't?
-Oh, my God.

154
00:08:01,618 --> 00:08:03,723
George, this must have
cost a fortune.

155
00:08:03,986 --> 00:08:05,874
Money.

156
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:08,554
Jerry, how could you
let him spend so much?

157
00:08:08,723 --> 00:08:10,152
I tried to stop him.

158
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:15,377
I couldn't. He just wants
to make people happy.

159
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:19,724
George, this is one of the nicest
things anyone has ever given me.

160
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:22,890
Good. Good. Listen, take it off.
You're gonna wear it out already.

161
00:08:23,058 --> 00:08:24,846
Its for special occasions, this thing.

162
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:29,834
What's that red dot
on your sweater?

163
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:35,275
-What?
-Listen, take it off.

164
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:37,546
Im getting hot just looking at it.

165
00:08:37,713 --> 00:08:40,168
What is this?
Its like a red dot.

166
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:42,409
What? What red dot?
What are you talking about?

167
00:08:42,577 --> 00:08:46,058
Jerry, come here for a second.
Do you see anything here?

168
00:08:46,737 --> 00:08:48,427
I don't know.

169
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:50,479
I don't know.

170
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:54,285
-What don't you know?
-I don't know.

171
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:58,185
Well, do you see it, or don't you?

172
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:01,125
Say that again.

173
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:04,015
Do you see it, or don't you?

174
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:08,965
Do I see it or don't l?
That's the question.

175
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:25,354
Now, what did you ask me again?

176
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:41,604
You're still here?
You're a dynamo.

177
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:45,189
-I can't believe I get paid for this.
-God.

178
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:48,364
Ill see you tomorrow.

179
00:09:55,374 --> 00:09:57,065
-How you doing?
-Hello.

180
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:11,819
You had sex with the cleaning woman
on your desk?

181
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,472
Who are you?
How did you do that?

182
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:16,874
Hennigan's.

183
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:18,849
Hennigan's?

184
00:10:19,021 --> 00:10:22,916
I was sitting there in the office,
and the cleaning woman comes in.

185
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:25,899
Ive always been attracted
to cleaning women.

186
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:29,921
Cleaning women, chambermaids....

187
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:33,123
Yeah, chambermaids,
Im attracted to them too.

188
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,781
-Why is that?
-Its a woman in your room.

189
00:10:38,956 --> 00:10:41,738
-So go ahead.
-So...

190
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,267
...she starts vacuuming,
back and forth, back and forth...

191
00:10:47,435 --> 00:10:49,672
...her hips swiveling...

192
00:10:49,836 --> 00:10:51,941
...her breasts....

193
00:10:52,428 --> 00:10:54,283
Convulsing?

194
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,922
-Convulsing?
-I don't know. Im trying to help you.

195
00:10:58,251 --> 00:11:00,039
So then I asked her
if she wanted a drink.

196
00:11:00,203 --> 00:11:03,138
-You don't drink.
-I couldn't think of anything else to say.

197
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:07,049
-So you started drinking.
-So we started drinking, and....

198
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:09,415
I don't know if it was the alcohol
or the ammonia...

199
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,481
...but the next thing I knew,
she was mopping the floor with me.

200
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,799
-And how was it?
-The sex was okay...

201
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:20,384
...but I threw up
from the Hennigan's.

202
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:24,775
Good thing the cleaning lady
was there.

203
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:30,917
Dick was fired.

204
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:34,595
You mean to tell me, I put that drink
six inches over to the right...

205
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,609
-...and this wouldn't have happened?
-You knew he was an alcoholic.

206
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:40,006
-Why'd you put the drink down?
-What are you saying?

207
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:42,147
-Im not saying anything.
-Yes, you are.

208
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:44,647
-What could I be saying?
-You must be saying something.

209
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:46,565
lf I was, I would have said it.

210
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:47,907
-Say it.
-I said it.

211
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:49,764
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

212
00:11:51,657 --> 00:11:54,112
Its exhausting being with you.

213
00:11:55,913 --> 00:11:57,090
-Yeah.
-<i>It's George.

214
00:11:57,256 --> 00:11:59,361
-Come on up.
-Hey.

215
00:11:59,913 --> 00:12:01,189
Let me ask you something.

216
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:04,287
Did George buy that sweater
knowing the red dot was on it...

217
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:06,344
...because it was cheaper?

218
00:12:06,953 --> 00:12:10,815
-Okay. You just gave me the answer.
-No, I didn't.

219
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:14,246
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
I saw your expression.

220
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:17,670
I didn't have an expression.
I have a deviated septum.

221
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:19,555
I have to--

222
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,950
I have to open my mouth
sometimes to breathe.

223
00:12:23,016 --> 00:12:24,838
How much did he save?

224
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:30,814
Frankly, I am shocked that you
could ask such a question of me.

225
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,245
lf l-- The only surprise was how
you could even think of that.

226
00:12:34,407 --> 00:12:37,025
That's what you were seeing.

227
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,282
I have to talk to you.

228
00:12:41,447 --> 00:12:43,683
This cleaning woman's
turning the screws on me.

229
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,886
She's pushing for this
whole relationship thing.

230
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:48,673
She keeps calling me.
She's threatening to go to the boss.

231
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,141
I could lose my job.
I gotta keep her quiet.

232
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:53,822
Elaine's in the bathroom.
She's wise to the red-dot thing.

233
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:56,641
She's asking me
all kinds of questions about it.

234
00:12:58,822 --> 00:13:00,480
-Did you tell her anything?
-No.

235
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,915
-You swear?
-Im not swearing. I don't wanna swear.

236
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:04,288
-Come on, swear.
-No.

237
00:13:04,453 --> 00:13:06,461
-Oh, you told her, didn't you?
-No.

238
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:10,819
Hey, George, did you buy that sweater
knowing the red dot was on it...

239
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:13,370
...because you could get it
at a discount?

240
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,167
What?

241
00:13:15,781 --> 00:13:17,952
-Did I what?
-You did, didn't you?

242
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:21,598
Elaine, Im shocked.
Im shocked.

243
00:13:21,765 --> 00:13:26,108
Here I go out, in the spirit of the
season and spend all my savings...

244
00:13:26,277 --> 00:13:29,758
...to buy you the most beautiful
Christmas sweater I have ever seen...

245
00:13:29,924 --> 00:13:32,477
...to show my appreciation to you
at Christmas...

246
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,296
...and this is the thanks I get
at Christmas.

247
00:13:37,412 --> 00:13:39,714
-Well, Jerry told me that you did.
-You told her?

248
00:13:39,876 --> 00:13:42,396
How could you tell her?
What kind of friend are you?

249
00:13:42,564 --> 00:13:46,044
I didn't tell her, you stupid idiot.
She tricked you.

250
00:13:50,148 --> 00:13:52,537
Elaine, you don't understand.

251
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:56,572
I had a 1 03 temperature
when I bought that sweater.

252
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:59,421
I was so dizzy, I was seeing
red dots everywhere.

253
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:02,145
I thought everything in the store
had a red dot on it.

254
00:14:02,307 --> 00:14:05,602
I couldn't distinguish one red dot
from the other.

255
00:14:06,147 --> 00:14:07,674
I couldn't afford anything.

256
00:14:07,843 --> 00:14:11,520
I have nothing. I haven't worked
for a really long time.

257
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:14,017
I mean, look, I have no clothes.

258
00:14:14,178 --> 00:14:15,585
Look at what Im wearing.

259
00:14:15,746 --> 00:14:17,634
It was just a little red dot.

260
00:14:17,795 --> 00:14:19,966
A little red dot.

261
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:28,733
-This is for you.
-Oh, Georgie, you bought this for me?

262
00:14:29,154 --> 00:14:30,943
Oh, I knew you cared for me.

263
00:14:31,106 --> 00:14:33,975
As you care for me,
which is why it's very important...

264
00:14:34,146 --> 00:14:37,113
...that you never breathe a word
to anyone about....

265
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:40,860
You know? What with
Clarence Thomas and everything.

266
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:44,160
-Okay. Can I open it now?
-Yes, of course. Go ahead.

267
00:14:44,322 --> 00:14:47,104
My guess is you're gonna
like this very much.

268
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:53,531
-Is that cashmere?
-Of course it's cashmere.

269
00:14:53,697 --> 00:14:56,282
Oh, a cashmere sweater.

270
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:58,304
Oh, Georgie Porgie.

271
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,472
Just a little something for Christmas.

272
00:15:02,145 --> 00:15:07,861
When I was a little girl in Panama,
a rich American came to our town.

273
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:11,546
And he was wearing the softest,
most beautiful sweater.

274
00:15:11,713 --> 00:15:15,422
I said, ''What do you call
this beautiful fabric?''

275
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:17,558
And he said:

276
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:20,543
''They call it cashmere.''

277
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,776
I repeated the word.
''Cashmere, cashmere''...

278
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:29,016
...and I asked him if I could have it...

279
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:30,869
...and he said:

280
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,276
''No. Get away from me.''

281
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,701
And he started to walk away.

282
00:15:36,863 --> 00:15:38,936
Oh, but I grabbed onto his leg...

283
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,013
...screaming for him
to give me the sweater...

284
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:43,288
...and he dragged me
through the streets.

285
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:45,593
And then he kicked me
with the other foot...

286
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,061
...and he threw some change at me.

287
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:51,386
But I didn't want the change, Georgie.

288
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,963
I wanted the cashmere.

289
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:01,147
I had a feeling you would like it.

290
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:04,027
-Im going to try it on.
-No. Don't try it on now. Try it later.

291
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,125
Oh, look, it fits beautiful.

292
00:16:07,294 --> 00:16:10,076
All right, take it off.
You're gonna ruin it.

293
00:16:10,654 --> 00:16:12,377
What's this?

294
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:15,960
I was in a men's room the other day.

295
00:16:16,126 --> 00:16:19,988
They had the hand blower instead of
the paper towels. You know this thing?

296
00:16:20,157 --> 00:16:21,881
I like the hand blower, I have to say.

297
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:25,428
Takes a little bit longer,
but I feel when you're in a room...

298
00:16:25,597 --> 00:16:29,110
...with a revolting stench, you want
to spend as much time as you can.

299
00:16:30,493 --> 00:16:33,013
The only stench is coming from you.

300
00:16:33,181 --> 00:16:34,522
Oh, well, wait a second.

301
00:16:34,684 --> 00:16:37,466
I believe we have a heckler,
ladies and gentlemen.

302
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,287
Dick, I don't know
what your problem is.

303
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:41,427
Its not my fault
you're back on the wagon.

304
00:16:41,597 --> 00:16:43,539
Its ''off the wagon.''

305
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:47,156
In the old days, how do you think they
got the alcohol from town to town?

306
00:16:49,692 --> 00:16:51,514
-I don't know.
-On a wagon.

307
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:56,021
Don't you think they broke into a
couple of those bottles along the way?

308
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:58,555
You can't drink on a wagon.
Its too bumpy.

309
00:16:58,716 --> 00:17:01,137
They had smooth trails.
What about the Cumberland Gap.

310
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:03,348
What the hell do you know
about wagons?

311
00:17:03,516 --> 00:17:06,003
I know enough not to get on them.

312
00:17:08,668 --> 00:17:11,089
Im gonna get right to the point.

313
00:17:11,451 --> 00:17:14,266
Its come to my attention
that you and the cleaning woman...

314
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:18,169
...have engaged in sexual intercourse
on the desk in your office.

315
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:20,629
Is that correct?

316
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,867
-Who said that?
-She did.

317
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:29,972
Was that wrong?

318
00:17:30,747 --> 00:17:32,786
Should I not have done that?

319
00:17:32,954 --> 00:17:34,776
I got to plead ignorance
on this thing...

320
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:37,142
...because if anyone
had said anything to me...

321
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:41,168
...when I started here that that
sort of thing was frowned upon....

322
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:44,311
You know, because Ive worked
in a lot of offices...

323
00:17:44,474 --> 00:17:47,735
...and I tell you,
people do that all the time.

324
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:50,679
You're fired.

325
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:53,589
Well, you didn't have
to say it like that.

326
00:17:53,754 --> 00:17:55,990
I want you out of here
by the end of the day.

327
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:09,785
What about the whole Christmas-spirit
thing? Any flexibility there?

328
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:11,471
No.

329
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:15,061
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

330
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,022
She wanted me to give you this.

331
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:32,789
You had sex on your desk
with the cleaning woman.

332
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:35,378
You never had sex
in the office before?

333
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:38,453
No. I once made out with someone,
but that's it.

334
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:40,623
Okay. All right. So you made out.

335
00:18:40,792 --> 00:18:43,028
-Well, that's not sex.
-Kissing is sex.

336
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:45,270
Kissing is not sex.

337
00:18:45,432 --> 00:18:47,570
-George.
-Jerry.

338
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:51,826
Hey, did Jerry leave that drink
next to Dick's on purpose?

339
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,905
-No.
-George?

340
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:55,500
Over here.

341
00:18:57,143 --> 00:18:58,387
What are you doing here?

342
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:00,918
Im taking the kid out to dinner
to cheer him up.

343
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:04,013
Hey, Jerry, when do you consider sex
has taken place?

344
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:06,965
I would say...

345
00:19:07,126 --> 00:19:09,198
...when the nipple
makes its first appearance.

346
00:19:15,062 --> 00:19:20,528
So George told me that you left
the drink next to Dick's on purpose.

347
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:23,184
Nice try.

348
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,935
So guess who heckled me
at the club last night.

349
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,226
Merry Christmas!

350
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:36,494
-Oh, my God, that's Dick.
-Dick?

351
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:38,036
Dick!

352
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:41,810
Its <i>Cape Fear</i>.

353
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,491
Hide. Hide under the desk.

354
00:19:46,676 --> 00:19:48,018
-Move over.
-Get off of me.

355
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:50,898
-I have no room.
-My foot's sticking out.

356
00:19:51,061 --> 00:19:53,101
Shut up. He's coming.

357
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:11,122
Is that cashmere?

358
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,738
Of course it's cashmere.

359
00:20:17,844 --> 00:20:19,021
What's this?

360
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:26,599
But, in a way, I think I inadvertently
turned this guy into an alcoholic.

361
00:20:26,771 --> 00:20:28,331
I hate being around alcoholics.

362
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:31,882
They're either saying how much they
love you or how much they hate you.

363
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:34,698
Those are the two statements
that scare me most.

364
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:37,867
But I think he's okay now because
I don't know how he feels about me.

365
00:20:38,034 --> 00:20:41,100
-He's finally off the wagon.
-You mean on the wagon.

366
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:42,444
Don't get smart.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
