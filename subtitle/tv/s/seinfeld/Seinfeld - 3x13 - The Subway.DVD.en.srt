1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,501
As a kid, my favorite ride...

2
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:07,598
...was the bumper car. Remember?
Going around in a circle.

3
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:09,901
There was always one kid
that could not do it.

4
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:11,338
Do you remember this kid?

5
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,445
As soon as the ride gets started...

6
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:16,013
...he'd be, like, stuck
in a pack of empty cars.

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,945
Just--

8
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:21,977
"Excuse me.

9
00:00:22,288 --> 00:00:24,381
Excuse me. It won't go!

10
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,119
Come on!

11
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,756
It's almost over!"

12
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:31,992
He always ends up
with the attendant...

13
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,827
...hanging off that big pole
helping him steer it.

14
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,038
"Stop crying."

15
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:41,972
Then there's always
that other--

16
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,609
One other really bad car--

17
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:45,267
The helpless father-and-son team.

18
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,379
This is another car just
not going anywhere.

19
00:00:47,547 --> 00:00:49,742
They're never organized.
Who's on the wheel?

20
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:51,406
Who's pressing on the gas? Just:

21
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,575
"Son, turn the wheel."

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,724
All right, Coney lsland?

23
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,624
Okay, you can take the B or the F
and switch for the N...

24
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:05,094
...at Broadway and Lafayette.

25
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,256
Or you can go over the bridge
to DeKalb...

26
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,163
...and catch the Q
to Atlantic Avenue...

27
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:12,327
...then switch to the lRT,
2, 3, 4 or 5.

28
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,767
But don't get on the G.

29
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,067
That's very tempting,
but you wind up on Smith...

30
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,540
...and 9th Street.
Then you gotta get on the R.

31
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:22,109
Couldn't he just take the D
straight to Coney lsland?

32
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:23,838
Well, yeah.

33
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,220
Okay. What time is your
job interview, George?

34
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,617
9:45.

35
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,121
Don't whistle on the elevator.

36
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,083
-Why not?
-That's what Willy Loman told Biff...

37
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,491
...before his interview
in Death of a Salesman.

38
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,962
You're comparing me to Biff Loman?
Very encouraging.

39
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,897
The biggest loser in the history
of American literature.

40
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,435
-I gotta get going.
-What time's the lesbian wedding?

41
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:48,002
-9:30.
-Lesbian wedding.

42
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,109
How do they work the bride and groom
on that? Do they flip a coin?

43
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,336
Yeah, they flip a coin.

44
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,973
What, was that not politically correct?
It's a legitimate question.

45
00:01:57,484 --> 00:02:00,749
I'm so tired. I'm gonna fall asleep
on that train.

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,445
I feel when lesbians are looking at me,
they're thinking:

47
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,488
"That's why I'm not a heterosexual."

48
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,561
All right, Jerry, come on.
Pick up the check so we can go.

49
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,288
-I'm paying for breakfast?
-Yeah.

50
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,059
-Yeah.
-Why do I always pay?

51
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,169
What am l, made of money?

52
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,960
You bunch of deadbeats.

53
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,405
How many tickets you paying today?

54
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:27,140
Let's see. Speeding, running a
red light, no license, no registration...

55
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:30,975
...no plates, no brake lights,
no rear-view mirror.

56
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,280
Look at that one.

57
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,981
-"No doors"?
-Yeah, I'm fighting that one.

58
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:39,187
You know, this is gonna cost me
over 600 bucks.

59
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,160
I can't carry change in these pants.
It falls out.

60
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,862
-Here you go.
-There you go.

61
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,398
Thank you.

62
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:53,868
That guy's not blind.

63
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,736
So can I convince anybody
to come down to Coney lsland?

64
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,243
Gotta pick up my car
at the pound. George?

65
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:02,313
I can't believe they found
your stolen car.

66
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:03,847
Not only did they find it...

67
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,508
...it was simonized,
and the front end was aligned.

68
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,181
-That's amazing.
-So, what do you say?

69
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,789
Ride on the Cyclone.
Hot dog at Nathan's on me.

70
00:03:11,958 --> 00:03:14,290
Who are you, Satan?
I'm close to a job here.

71
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,792
-It's my second interview.
-All right, Biff.

72
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,156
Elaine? Merry-go-round?

73
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,461
I can't. I'm the best man.

74
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,031
Kramer. Bumper cars.

75
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,300
I gotta go to court. I'll get in trouble.
What's the matter with you?

76
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:31,670
It could be years till I get
back to Coney lsland.

77
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,175
I can't go on the rides alone.

78
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,213
42nd Street. Change for the D
and the double R...

79
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,782
...the 2, 3, 4, 5, 7,
the C, K and F train.

80
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,294
Well....

81
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,932
See you.

82
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,250
Hey!

83
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,824
Yeah!

84
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:53,248
-You looking for a job?
-Me? Why?

85
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,678
Well, you're reading
the classifieds.

86
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,016
Oh, no. No, no.

87
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,183
I was just looking for the stock page.
Here it is.

88
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:03,227
Looking for the quotes.

89
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,863
Gotta check the quotes.

90
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,862
Love a good quote.

91
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,330
IBM up a quarter.

92
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,033
What do you know?

93
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:14,399
You didn't look like someone
who needed a job.

94
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,768
Me? No, I don't.

95
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:22,275
Doing very well. Very well, yeah.

96
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,011
So you're in the market?

97
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:27,482
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm in the market.

98
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:28,881
Which market?

99
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,451
Which market? The.... The big one.

100
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:35,059
The big market with the big board.

101
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,823
Bull market, bear market.
You name the market, I'm there.

102
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:42,397
So do you work for one of
the big brokerage houses?

103
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,899
They wish.

104
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,503
I hate the big brokerage houses.

105
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,161
Hate them with a passion.

106
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,103
Big brokerage houses
killed my father.

107
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,907
-Really?
-Well, they hurt him bad.

108
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,137
Really hurt his feelings.

109
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:57,476
It's a long story.
I don't like to talk about it...

110
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,880
...but I swore I would never work
for a big brokerage house.

111
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:04,079
See, all they care about is money.

112
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:07,182
I'm about more than money.
I'm about...

113
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,588
...people.

114
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,954
So I've always gone my own way...

115
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,360
...and I've never looked back.

116
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:37,986
I started riding these trains
in the '40s.

117
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:42,387
Those days, a man would give up
his seat for a woman.

118
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,291
Now we're liberated.
We have to stand.

119
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,827
It's ironic.

120
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,362
What's ironic?

121
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,671
This. That we've come all this way,
we made all this progress...

122
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,865
...but, you know, we lost
the little things, the niceties.

123
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,974
No, I mean,
what does "ironic" mean?

124
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,378
Where you off to
with such a nice present?

125
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,677
-Birthday party?
-A wedding.

126
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:08,650
-A wedding?
-Yeah.

127
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,752
I didn't think people
still get married.

128
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:15,157
It's hard today
with the men and women.

129
00:08:15,528 --> 00:08:16,756
You're telling me.

130
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:20,590
-So they're a nice couple?
-Oh, very nice.

131
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,199
What does he do,
if you don't mind my asking?

132
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,996
-She.
-She?

133
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:29,073
She. She works, he doesn't.
He sounds like my son.

134
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:31,238
There is no "he."

135
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,208
There's no he?

136
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,506
So who's getting married?

137
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,415
Two women.

138
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,176
It's...

139
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,752
...a lesbian wedding.

140
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,852
Lesbian wedding?

141
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,785
Yep. Yep, I'm...

142
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:52,025
...the best man.

143
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:55,866
Great.

144
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:01,699
My luck. I don't talk to a soul
on the subway for 35 years...

145
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,570
...I get the best man
at a lesbian wedding.

146
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,473
No, no. You don't understand.

147
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,238
I'm not a lesbian!

148
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,577
I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian.

149
00:09:58,397 --> 00:09:59,955
I'm really looking forward to this.

150
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,999
I love weddings.
Maybe I'll meet somebody.

151
00:10:04,136 --> 00:10:05,467
Maybe not.

152
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:11,567
Oh, man. We're stopping?

153
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,180
Well, this is where I get off.

154
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,113
-You do?
-Yeah.

155
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,379
Hey, why don't you...? Oh, nothing.

156
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:24,017
No, no. What?

157
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,590
Well, I was gonna say,
"Why don't you get off with me."

158
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,750
But you're obviously very busy
on your way...

159
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,919
...to some important meeting
or something.

160
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,124
Yeah. Well....

161
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,767
See, I knew it was a bad idea.

162
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,870
Hey, what's another million,
give or take? I get off...

163
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,011
...when and where I wanna get off.

164
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,547
I'm stuck. Could you just pull it
a little--?

165
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,013
This'll just be a second.

166
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,251
Don't-- Don't start the train!

167
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,648
Don't start the train!

168
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,749
Here it is. Here it is,
the four horse in the first race.

169
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:01,085
-Pappernick.
-How do you know he's gonna win?

170
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,852
My UPS guy. Lance.

171
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,361
The guys who own the horse
are his regular customers.

172
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,260
Every horse he's ever given me
has won.

173
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,264
-Yeah?
-Yeah. They've been sandbagging...

174
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,960
...Iooking for a good spot.
He's been getting in light...

175
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,369
...because they're using a bug boy.
The workouts have been unpublished.

176
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,941
They're ready to run with him.
Gonna break his maiden.

177
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,544
He's gonna go for a great price,
maybe 30-1.

178
00:11:20,713 --> 00:11:23,238
-I'm telling you, it's a lock.
-But it rained last night.

179
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,941
Exactly. This horse loves the slop.

180
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,552
It's in his bloodlines.
His father was a mudder.

181
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,985
-His mother was a mudder.
-His mother was a mudder?

182
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,058
What did I say? Let's go to the office.
I'm gonna call my bookie.

183
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,750
Hey, don't tell anybody.

184
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,622
Oh, man.

185
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,617
Okay.

186
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,834
You realize, of course, you're naked.

187
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,664
Naked, dressed,
I don't see any difference.

188
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,734
You ought to sit here.

189
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,375
There's a difference.

190
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,577
You got something
against the naked body?

191
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,143
I got something against yours.

192
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:33,249
How about a couple of deep knee
bends, maybe some squat-thrusts?

193
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,478
Who's got time for squat-thrusts?

194
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:38,122
All right, how about
skipping breakfast?

195
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,191
I'm guessing you're not a
"half-grapefruit and black coffee" man.

196
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,657
I like a good breakfast.

197
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:45,626
I understand.
I like a good breakfast...

198
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:49,165
...Iong as you don't wind up trapped
in a room in overalls and pigtails...

199
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:51,166
...being counseled by Dick Gregory.

200
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,932
I'm not ashamed of my body.

201
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:58,008
Exactly. That's your problem.
You should be.

202
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:00,306
Don't get up.

203
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,709
Please, allow me.

204
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,481
Oh, this is great.

205
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,713
This is what I need,
just what I need.

206
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,651
Okay, take it easy.
I'm sure it's nothing.

207
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:15,623
Probably rats on the track.

208
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,763
They're stopping for rats.

209
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,223
God, it's so crowded.

210
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,492
How could there be
so many people?

211
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:25,193
This guy really smells.

212
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,305
Doesn't anyone use deodorant
in the city?

213
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,135
What is so hard?
You take the cap off, you roll it on.

214
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,903
What's that? I feel something
rubbing against me.

215
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:36,780
These disgusting animals.
These people should be in a cage.

216
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,211
We are in a cage.

217
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:40,212
What if I miss the wedding?

218
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,819
I got the ring. What'll they do?

219
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,478
You can't get married
without a ring. Oh, God--

220
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,754
I can't breathe.

221
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,325
I feel faint.

222
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,429
Okay, take it easy.
It'll start moving soon.

223
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:54,532
Think about people in concentration
camps, what they went through.

224
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,601
And the hostages! What would
you do if you were a hostage?

225
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,466
Think about that. This is nothing.

226
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,233
No, it's not nothing, it's something.

227
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,105
It's a nightmare. Help me!

228
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,145
Move it! Come on!
Move this f****** thing!

229
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:10,748
Why isn't it moving?!

230
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,612
What could go wrong with a train?
It's on tracks.

231
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,846
There's no traffic.
How could a train get stuck?

232
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,751
Step on the gas!

233
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:21,916
What could it be? You'd think the
conductor would explain it to us.

234
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:25,222
"I'm sorry, there's a delay.
We'll be moving in five minutes. "

235
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,889
I wanna hear a voice.
What's that on my leg?!

236
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,910
Nice.

237
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,509
Your company sends you
on the road often, huh?

238
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:48,752
Nice. Oh, hey, nice ice bucket there.

239
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,548
Make yourself comfortable.

240
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:54,783
Make myself comfortable?
What does that mean?

241
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:58,157
Does she want me to take my clothes
off? Is she taking her clothes off?

242
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,625
What if I take mine off
and she still has hers on?

243
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,290
I'd look like an idiot.
She'd get offended and leave.

244
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,300
So maybe I should leave them on.

245
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,939
But what if she takes hers off?
She'll feel humiliated.

246
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,841
"Make yourself comfortable?"
This woman's unbelievable.

247
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,773
This "comfortable" thing
could ruin me.

248
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:16,108
I got it. I'll take my shoes off
and sit on the bed.

249
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,510
There. That's comfortable.

250
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,307
She can't accuse me
of being uncomfortable.

251
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,458
I gotta tell you,
I'm pretty comfortable.

252
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,190
Oh, yeah, it's all set.

253
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,454
-They've got the bug boy on it.
-The bug boy?

254
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,226
Yeah, the little fellow's
been riding his heart out.

255
00:15:36,402 --> 00:15:38,427
-They're gonna break his maiden.
-Really?

256
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,071
-Yeah.
-It's a little slow out.

257
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,434
-Rained last night.
-This baby loves the slop.

258
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,668
Loves it. Eats it up.
Eats the slop. Born to slop.

259
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,106
His father was a mudder.

260
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,679
-His father was a mudder.
-His mother was a mudder.

261
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:51,281
His mother was a mudder?

262
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,045
What did I just say?

263
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:56,145
Hey. All right.

264
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,189
Six hundred, Pappernick to win.

265
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,895
They still have no pitching.
Gooden's a question mark.

266
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,395
You don't recover from those
rotator cuffs so fast.

267
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,829
I'm not worried about
the Mets' pitching.

268
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:12,801
-They got no hitting.
-No, they got hitting. Bonilla, Murray.

269
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,304
-They got no defense.
-Defense, please.

270
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,272
-They need speed.
-Speed? They've got Coleman.

271
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:20,605
-They need a bullpen.
-Franco's no good?

272
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:23,145
-They got no team leaders.
-They got Franco.

273
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,907
What they need is a front office.

274
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,514
-But you gotta like their chances.
-I love them.

275
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:31,247
If they win it this year, I'll sit naked
with you at the World Series.

276
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:33,488
It's a deal.

277
00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:37,824
Why couldn't I take a cab?

278
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,160
For $6, my whole life
could have changed.

279
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,668
What is that on my leg?

280
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,196
I'll never get out of here.

281
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,468
What if I'm here
for the rest of my life?

282
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,240
Maybe I'll get out in five seconds.

283
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,973
One banana, two banana...

284
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:58,412
...three banana, four banana...

285
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:00,176
...five banana.

286
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,578
No. I'm still here.

287
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,354
Still here.
When will they start moving?

288
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,925
Move!

289
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,756
Move! Move!

290
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,489
It's moving.

291
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,562
It's moving!

292
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:18,694
Yes!

293
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:20,266
Yes.

294
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:24,002
Mother******!

295
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,115
Gee, I hope you have the key
for these things.

296
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,377
Oh, don't worry, I do.

297
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,780
My mother used to walk
around our apartment...

298
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:40,254
...in her bra and panties.

299
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,224
She didn't look anything like you.
She was...

300
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,729
...really disgusting, really bad body.

301
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,834
You know, if you can imagine an
uglier, fatter version of Shirley Booth.

302
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,097
Remember Shirley Booth in Hazel?

303
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,939
Really embarrassing,
because I had the only mother...

304
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,237
...in the neighborhood
who was worse than Hazel.

305
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,540
-You can imagine the taunts I'd hear.
-Like what?

306
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:05,182
Like:

307
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:08,111
"Hey, your mother's
uglier than Hazel."

308
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,217
"Hazel really puts your mother
to shame." You know.

309
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,693
What's going on?

310
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:24,196
It was a pleasure doing business
with you, but I have to get going.

311
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,867
Get going? But we haven't really,
you know....

312
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,574
Eight dollars?

313
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:31,936
-Eight dollars?
-What are you doing, robbing me?

314
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,375
I wasted my whole morning
on you for $8?

315
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:37,205
Wait a second.
What are you doing?

316
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:40,017
-I'm taking your clothes.
-No, no, that's my only suit!

317
00:18:40,185 --> 00:18:43,120
It cost me $350!
I got it at Moe Ginsburg!

318
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,950
-Bye, George.
-You can't just leave me here.

319
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,989
Will I see you again?

320
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,729
It's Hoy's Boy followed by Jamet...

321
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,804
...Little Baggit, Kiss Harmony
and then a long way to Flagrant.

322
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,806
-Come on!
-Into the stretch...

323
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,207
...with an 1/8th of a mile to go,
Stepagain, Passionel battling it out.

324
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:10,143
Clear from Jamet, Pappernick's
starting to make some ground...

325
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,807
-...but Stepagain is the leader....
-Come on.

326
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,285
-Come on! Yes!
-Look at Pappernick, sprouting wings.

327
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:19,788
-Yes! Yes!
-Stepagain, just falling back.

328
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,153
-Yes!
-Pappernick flashing home.

329
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,922
Stepagain, Pappernick, Pappernick
and Stepagain to the line....

330
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,858
-Yes! Yes! Yes!
-The winner is Pappernick.

331
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,163
Yes, yes! I won. Hey!

332
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,607
Yeah.

333
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,150
I haven't had a hot dog
at Nathan's in 20 years.

334
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,719
First, we ride the Cyclone.

335
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,913
Chilly out.

336
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,595
French fries.

337
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,731
Hey, hey!

338
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,504
Give me the money.

339
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,575
Freeze! Police!

340
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,181
No, I never got the car.
We had such a good time...

341
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,322
...by the time I got to
the police garage, it was closed.

342
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,618
Too bad.

343
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,918
You wouldn't believe what this guy
put away at Nathan's.

344
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,359
Look at what we won.
You want him?

345
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,929
Get that out of my face.

346
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:11,267
So you missed the wedding.
You'll catch the bris.

347
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,311
Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna!

348
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:24,941
How'd you like a Hare Krishna fist
down your throat, you little punk?

349
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,208
George.

350
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,615
Biff.

351
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,622
What, did you whistle
on the elevator?

352
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:34,883
I have my spare key
in your apartment, right?

353
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,691
Yeah, in the kitchen drawer.

354
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:38,591
-Give me your key.
-What happened?

355
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:42,063
Never mind what happened,
just give me the key.

356
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:45,397
-Come on, I'll go with you.
-Here. Pay.

357
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:48,736
Wait, wait. Give me that.

358
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:56,939
All right.

359
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,814
So I take the subway
down to Coney lsland...

360
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,217
...to go on the Cyclone.
I'm riding on the subway.

361
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,586
I'm sitting on the D train
for an hour and 15 minutes...

362
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,319
...to go on a scary ride.

363
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:12,655
Okay, how dumb is that?

364
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,129
You know that first sharp drop
on the Cyclone? Fell asleep.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
