1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,900
I hate clothes, okay?

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,400
I hate buying them.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,500
I hate picking them out of my closet.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,100
I can't stand every day trying to come
up with little outfits for myself.

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,400
I think eventually...

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,100
...fashion won't even exist.

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,000
We'll all be wearing the same thing.

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,800
Because any time I see a movie
or a TV show...

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,300
...where there's people
from the future...

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,200
...they're all wearing the same thing.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,700
Somehow they decided,
"This is going to be our outfit."

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,400
One-piece silver jumpsuit,
V-stripe and boots. That's it.

13
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,700
We should come up with an outfit
for Earth. An Earth outfit.

14
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,000
We should vote on it.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,400
Candidates propose
different outfits. No speeches.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,500
They walk out, twirl, walk off.

17
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,900
We just sit in the audience and go,
"That was nice. I could wear that."

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,500
- I think I've seen enough.
- I might have something in the back.

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,600
The back? They never find
anything in the back.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,100
If they had anything good,
they'd put it in the front.

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,600
Why don't they open an entire store
for the back? Call it "Just Back."

22
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,600
All back. No front.

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,600
You walk in the front,
you're immediately in the back.

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,400
Look, Elaine. Tie carwash.

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,800
- I just read that. That's terrific.
- Her father wrote that.

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,200
- Alton Benes is your father?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,100
I always felt he deserved
a wider audience.

28
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,800
I'm not so sure he wants one.

29
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,600
Hey, don't forget Sunday, okay?

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,700
You and George are coming, right?
Hotel Westbury, 8:00.

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,900
Yeah, I guess I'm coming. I mean...

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,300
- What, you don't wanna go now?
- No, I'll go. I'm going.

33
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,200
No, Jerry, you have to.
I need a buffer.

34
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,800
I haven't seen my father
in a while, and, you know, it's...

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,300
I'm worried I won't be able talk to him.
He's such a great writer.

36
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,300
Frankly, I prefer
the company of nitwits.

37
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,600
So that's why
we're not together anymore.

38
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,300
What is this?

39
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,200
This is beautiful.

40
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,000
These jackets never fit me right.

41
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,600
Try it on.

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,400
Wow.

43
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,900
This is soft suede.

44
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,600
This may be the most perfect jacket
I have ever put on.

45
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,600
- How much is it?
- Oh, my God.

46
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,100
Bad?

47
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,400
- Very bad?
- You have no idea.

48
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,200
- I have some idea.
- No idea.

49
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,400
- I've got a ballpark.
- There's no park...

50
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,100
...and the team has relocated.

51
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,400
Let me see that.

52
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,700
That is high.

53
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,600
Oh, man, that is
a beautiful jacket, though.

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,700
What's with the pink lining
with the candy stripes?

55
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,100
It's just lining.
You can always have it changed.

56
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,900
Should I get it?

57
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,100
I hate these moments. I'm hearing
the dual voices now, you know?

58
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,100
"What about the money?"
"What's money?"

59
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,400
It looks wonderful on you.

60
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

61
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,000
New jacket.

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,900
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

63
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,800
- Is it me?
- That's definitely you.

64
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,300
- Really?
- That's more you...

65
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,200
...than you've ever been.

66
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,900
- What is with the pink lining?
- I don't know. It's got a pink lining.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,900
- So, what'd you pay for this?
- I paid what it costs.

68
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,500
- How much?
- What's the difference?

69
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,000
- You're not gonna tell me?
- I'd rather not say out loud.

70
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,400
It's embarrassing.

71
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,100
- Over 300?
- Yes. But let's just stop it right there.

72
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,500
- It's over 400.
- I'm really not answering anymore.

73
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,300
- Is it over 400?
- Would you...?

74
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,100
Whoa, Nelson.

75
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,000
I know. I know.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,600
What are you gonna do
with the leather one?

77
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,500
I don't know.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,100
Are you gonna wear it?

79
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,400
- I don't know, maybe.
- Well, you're not gonna wear this.

80
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,900
Do you want it?

81
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,800
Yeah, okay, I'll take it.

82
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,000
I like that jacket.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,800
- Okay, take it.
- Hey. Good karma for you.

84
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Oh, baby.

85
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,600
What is that song?

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,300
It's from Les Misérables.
I went to see it last week.

87
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,000
I can't get it out of my head.
I just keep singing it over and over.

88
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,400
It just comes out.
I have no control over it.

89
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm singing it on elevators, buses.
Singing in front of clients.

90
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,700
It's taking over my life.

91
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,700
You know, Schumann
went mad from that.

92
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,400
Artie Schumann
from Camp Hatchapee?

93
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,000
- No, you idiot.
- What are you, Bud Abbott?

94
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,200
What are you calling me an idiot for?

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,400
You don't know Robert Schumann,
the composer?

96
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,800
Oh, Schumann. Of course.

97
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,000
He went crazy from one note.
Couldn't get it out of his head.

98
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,700
I think it was an A. He kept
repeating it over and over again.

99
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,800
He had to be institutionalised.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,400
Really?

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,900
Well, what if it doesn't stop?

102
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,800
Oh, that I really needed to hear.
That helps a lot.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,300
All right, just say something.
Just start talking. Change the subject.

104
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,400
Let's just go, all right?

105
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,000
I can't believe we're having dinner
with Alton Benes.

106
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,600
I know exactly what's gonna happen.

107
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,900
I'm gonna try and act
like I'm not impressed.

108
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,200
- He'll see right through it.
- He'll look at us...

109
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,600
...like he's backstage
at a puppet show.

110
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,800
Let me just get my jacket.

111
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
This is huge.

112
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,800
- When did this happen?
- Wednesday.

113
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,900
This jacket has completely
changed my life.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,900
When I leave the house in this...

115
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,000
...it's with a whole different confidence.

116
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,300
Like, tonight I might've been
a little nervous, but inside this jacket...

117
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,800
...I am composed, grounded, secure
that I can meet any social challenge.

118
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,000
Can I say one thing to you?

119
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,500
And I say this with an unblemished
record of staunch heterosexuality.

120
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,200
Absolutely.

121
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,100
It's fabulous.

122
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,300
- I know.
- And I'll tell you something else...

123
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,300
...l'm not even gonna ask you.

124
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,000
I wanna know,
but I'm not gonna ask.

125
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,800
You'll tell me
when you feel comfortable.

126
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,900
So, what was it, 400?

127
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,200
Five hundred?
Did you pay 500 for this?

128
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,500
Over 6? Can't be 7. Don't tell me
you paid $700 for this jacket.

129
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,600
Did you pay $700 for this jacket?
Is that what you're saying to me?

130
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,300
You are sick! Is that what
you paid for this jacket?

131
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,800
Over 700?!

132
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,800
What did you pay for this jacket?
I won't say anything.

133
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,800
I wanna know what you paid
for this jacket.

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,400
Oh, my God! A thousand dollars?!
You paid $1000 for this jacket.

135
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,500
All right. I'm walking out
of here right now...

136
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,700
...thinking you paid $1000
for this jacket...

137
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,700
...unless you tell me different.

138
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,400
All right, I'll tell you what.

139
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,500
If you don't say anything in five
seconds, I'll know it was over 1000.

140
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,100
Hey. Hey, will you do me a solid?

141
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,800
- What kind of solid?
- Sit in the car for two minutes...

142
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:17,400
...while it's double-parked.
I gotta pick up some birds.

143
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,500
- Birds?
- A friend of mine, he's a magician.

144
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,200
He's away on vacation. He asked me
to take care of his doves.

145
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,400
- So take a cab.
- They won't take a cage full of birds.

146
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,600
I can't. I'm on my way out.
There's no way I can do it.

147
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,200
- George, do me a solid. Two minutes.
- Well, I'm going with him.

148
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,500
I'd like to. I've never done
a solid before.

149
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,400
All right. I'll... Yeah. All right.
Have a good one.

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,800
Two minutes. Believe me,
I know his two minutes.

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,300
By his conception of time,
his life will last over 2000 years.

152
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,900
Schumann.

153
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,900
Where are they?

154
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,900
Maybe he didn't show up.

155
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,200
What, you don't wanna do this?

156
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
There's never been
an appointment in my life...

157
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,400
...where I wanted the other guy
to show up.

158
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,300
Wait a second. Is that him?

159
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,500
Yeah. I think it is.

160
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,000
Where's Elaine?

161
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,700
I'm nervous.

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
- Excuse me, Mr. Benes.
- Yeah.

163
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,500
I'm Jerry, Elaine's friend.
This is George.

164
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,400
It's a great thrill to meet you, sir.

165
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,100
Sit down.

166
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,900
- Want a drink?
- Sure.

167
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,600
- What'll you have?
- Cranberry juice with two limes.

168
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,000
And I'll have a club soda with no ice.

169
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll have another scotch
with plenty of ice.

170
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,200
You like ice.

171
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,900
- I say, do you like ice?
- Like it?

172
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,000
Don't you find that you get more
without it?

173
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,000
- Where's Elaine?
- Well, we thought...

174
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,800
...she was meeting you earlier.

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,200
She's usually pretty punctual.

176
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,700
Don't you find that, George?

177
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,600
Yeah. Yeah, she's punctual, and...

178
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,400
...she's been late sometimes.

179
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,600
Yeah, yeah.
Sometimes she's on time...

180
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,400
...and sometimes she's late.

181
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
I guess...

182
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,600
...today she's late.

183
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,800
It appears that way.

184
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,200
- Yep.
- Yep.

185
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,600
- Looks like rain.
- I know. I know. That's what they said.

186
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,100
- Who said?
- The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,600
I don't need anybody to tell me
it's gonna rain.

188
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,200
Oh, no. Of course not. l...

189
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,100
All I have to do is stick my head
out the window.

190
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,100
Which one's supposed to be
the funny guy?

191
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,200
- Oh, he's the comedian.
- I'm just a regular person.

192
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,100
No, no. He's just being modest.

193
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,100
We had a funny guy
with us in Korea.

194
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,900
A tail gunner.

195
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,000
They blew his brains out
all over the Pacific.

196
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,400
There's nothing funny about that.

197
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,200
Would you excuse me?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

198
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,800
I'll be right back.

199
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,500
I just wanted to tell you
that I really enjoyed Fair Game.

200
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,300
I thought it was just brilliant.

201
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,300
Drivel.

202
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,500
Yeah, maybe some parts.

203
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,200
What parts?

204
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,400
The...

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,700
...drivel parts.

206
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,200
Oh, my gosh. I just realized
I have to make a phone call.

207
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,300
I can't believe... Would you...?
I'll be right back.

208
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,000
Thank you for leaving me alone
with him.

209
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,600
That was brutal.
I can't go back out there.

210
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,300
- Well, let's just leave.
- Elaine will kill me.

211
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,800
- Where is she?
- She's gotta be here soon.

212
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,100
How could she leave us alone
with this lunatic?

213
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,200
Ten more minutes, and that's it,
I'm leaving.

214
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,300
I have to tell you,
this guy scares me.

215
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,300
The waiter was trembling.

216
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,700
We can't possibly have dinner
with him alone.

217
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,300
- How we gonna get out of it?
- We say we're frightened...

218
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,300
...and we have to go home.

219
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,600
Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk
our heads together like Moe.

220
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,900
I don't know. Just start scratching.

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,800
Tell him you have the crabs.
He was in the military.

222
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,700
He'll understand that.

223
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,100
All fathers are intimidating.

224
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,800
They're intimidating
because they are fathers.

225
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,300
Once a man has children,
for the rest of his life his attitude is:

226
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,800
"The hell with the world,
I can make my own people.

227
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,100
I'll eat whatever I want.
I'll wear whatever I want...

228
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,900
...and I'll create whoever I want."

229
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,400
Who'd you call?

230
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:05,800
My uncle is having an operation.
I just wanted to see how he was.

231
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
What kind of an operation?

232
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,700
Bone marrow.

233
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
- Mr. Benes?
- Yeah.

234
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,100
Message for you.

235
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,300
From Elaine.

236
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,000
She got tied up.

237
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,400
She'll be here in 30 minutes.

238
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,800
Yeah, they should have taken care
of Castro when they had the chance.

239
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Like we did in Guatemala in '53.

240
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,400
- Well, Guatemala...
- Sure. Guatemala.

241
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,600
All right. You boys
get yourselves together.

242
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,000
We'll head up to the restaurant.
I'll leave a note for Elaine.

243
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,100
I'm going to the bathroom.

244
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,500
- Let's go.
- What about Elaine?

245
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,500
- Hell with Elaine.
- She'll be furious.

246
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,400
We're dying here!

247
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,400
That's her. She's here.

248
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Where is Dad?

249
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,300
He's in the bathroom.

250
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,500
Where have you been?

251
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,000
Kramer. That Kramer.

252
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,100
I'm just about to leave,
he calls me up.

253
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,500
He begs me to sit in his car
for two minutes...

254
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,600
...so he can pick up these birds.

255
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,900
Oh, you didn't.

256
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,300
Well, he said he'd drive me here
right after.

257
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,300
So I am sitting in his car
for 20 minutes!

258
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,100
He doesn't come down.
I am freezing.

259
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Then a cop comes by.
Tells me to get out of the car.

260
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,900
He's a city marshal.

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,900
He's towing the car away.

262
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,300
Kramer owes thousands of dollars
in back tickets.

263
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,000
He was gonna tow it
with me in the car.

264
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,900
So they tow the car.
Now I am standing outside...

265
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,100
...and I am freezing, but I cannot leave
because I gotta tell him...

266
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,400
...what happened to the car.

267
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,700
So finally, finally, he comes down
with this giant cage filled with doves.

268
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,100
He said he was getting instructions,
that each dove has a different diet.

269
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,700
So we're wandering around,
trying to get a cab...

270
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,000
...when two of these doves fly out.

271
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,800
Now we're running after these doves.

272
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I almost got hit by a bus.

273
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,800
So how is everything going
over here?

274
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,800
- Great.
- Couldn't be better.

275
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,000
Good, because Dad can make
some people a little uncomfortable.

276
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,700
- Oh, no.
- Get out of here.

277
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,900
Man, Kramer. I could kill him.

278
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,400
You know better than
to get involved with Kramer.

279
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,700
- He said he'd give me a lift.
- The lift.

280
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,600
Like the lure of the Siren's song.
Never what it seems to be.

281
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,300
Yet who among us can resist?

282
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,800
Where do you come up
with this stuff?

283
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,200
- Well, look who's here.
- Oh, hi, Dad.

284
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,500
Hello, dear.

285
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,300
- Who's the lipstick for?
- No one.

286
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,200
- How's your mother?
- Fine.

287
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,600
How about you, are you working?

288
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,300
Yeah. I'm reading manuscripts
for Pendant Publishing.

289
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,900
I told you 10 times.

290
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,600
Pendant? Those bastards.

291
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,300
Well, all right, boys.

292
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,500
We'll go to that Pakistani
restaurant on 46th Street.

293
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,100
You're not afraid of a little spice,
are you?

294
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,500
Pipe down, chorus boy.

295
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,700
Chorus boy?

296
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,200
It's snowing.

297
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,700
It's beautiful.

298
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,500
Snow?

299
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
Snow, that can't be good for suede,
can it?

300
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,900
I wouldn't think so.

301
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,800
What should I do?

302
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,900
We're taking a cab, aren't we?

303
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,500
Cab? It's only five blocks.

304
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,200
- Why don't you turn it inside out?
- Inside out. Great.

305
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,300
Wait a minute.

306
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,400
- What the hell do you call this?
- I turned my jacket inside out.

307
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
Well, you look like a damn fool.

308
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,800
Well, it's a new suede jacket.

309
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,100
It might get ruined.

310
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,900
Well, you're not walking with me
and my daughter dressed like that.

311
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,100
That's for damn sure.

312
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,300
It's... It's only a few blocks.

313
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,800
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

314
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,400
Come on up.

315
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,700
- Hey.
- Hey.

316
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,800
- I gotta feed the birds.
- So?

317
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,200
You got any of those Mini Ritzes?

318
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I can't believe that I do.

319
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,200
- What, are you going out?
- Yeah.

320
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
Hey, where's your new jacket?

321
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,200
- Oh, what'd you do to it?
- I was out in the snow last night.

322
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,500
Don't you know
what that does to suede?

323
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,100
I have an idea.

324
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,200
We can make the 9:30
at Cinema Three.

325
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,800
Okay.

326
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,600
Hello.

327
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,100
Thanks again for coming last night.
Dad said he had a great time.

328
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,500
- Is he still in town?
- He's driving back to Maryland tonight.

329
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,000
So, what are you gonna do
with that one now?

330
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,000
- I don't know.
- Well...

331
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,600
I didn't wanna tell you this,
but usually he hates everyone.

332
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,200
Really?

333
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,600
- You gonna throw this out?
- Well, I can't wear it.

334
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,500
Yeah, he liked you, though.

335
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,500
Said you reminded him
of somebody he knew in Korea.

336
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,800
Well, if you're just gonna throw it out,
you know, I could take it.

337
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Yeah. Go ahead. Take it.

338
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,300
Dad thinks George is gay.

339
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,700
Oh, because of all the singing?

340
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,300
No. He pretty much thinks
everyone is gay.

341
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,700
See, I like it like this.

342
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,900
Isn't that...?

343
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,300
Is this from the snow last night?

344
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,100
You know what you should have done?
You should have turned it inside out.

345
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,600
I'll try and remember that.

346
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,000
Boy, it's too bad
you gave me this one too.

347
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,000
Yeah. Too bad.

348
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,300
Gonna have to do something
about this lining.

349
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:57,200
I had a leather jacket that got ruined.
Now, why does moisture ruin leather?

350
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,700
I don't get this.

351
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,500
Aren't cows outside
most of the time?

352
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,700
I don't understand. When it's raining,
do cows go up to the farmhouse:

353
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,400
"Let us in. We're all wearing leather!

354
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,600
Open the door. We're gonna
ruin the whole outfit here."

355
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,700
"Is it suede?"
"I am suede.

356
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,200
The whole thing is suede. I can't
have this cleaned. It's all I got."

357
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
