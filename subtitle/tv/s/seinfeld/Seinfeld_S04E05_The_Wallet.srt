1
00:00:03,428 --> 00:00:05,953
My parents had two arguments
while they were driving...

2
00:00:06,131 --> 00:00:08,827
...over either how fast
my father was going...

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,059
...or how much gas
was left in the tank.

4
00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:14,205
My father had a standard defense
for either one of these.

5
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:18,809
It was always, "That's because
you're looking at it from an angle.

6
00:00:20,378 --> 00:00:23,438
If you were over here...
It looks from where you're sitting...

7
00:00:23,615 --> 00:00:26,948
...it looks like
I'm doing 90 on empty.

8
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:29,810
But that's because
you're over there.

9
00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:34,123
If you were over here, you'd know
I'm in the driveway with a full tank."

10
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:42,858
George and I went up to NBC, and
we told them the idea for the series.

11
00:00:43,034 --> 00:00:45,594
- We're waiting to sign the contract.
- They liked the idea?

12
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,170
- Yeah.
- What, you got leather seats here?

13
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:51,433
- Since when is George a writer?
- What writer? It's a sitcom.

14
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:54,043
This is exciting. When are
you gonna sign the contract?

15
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:55,645
Soon. There's a few problems.

16
00:00:55,814 --> 00:00:57,782
I wanna tell you,
that meal was the worst.

17
00:00:58,049 --> 00:00:59,812
What do you expect?
It's airline food.

18
00:00:59,984 --> 00:01:01,349
They give you that fish.

19
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,009
How could you
eat fish on a plane?

20
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,089
Because she puts up a stink
every time I have a piece of meat.

21
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:07,485
What kind of problems?

22
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:10,383
Well, George doesn't think
$ 13,000 is enough money.

23
00:01:10,562 --> 00:01:11,961
What? He's not even working.

24
00:01:12,263 --> 00:01:15,198
George is right. Those people
will try to get away with murder.

25
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,231
Believe me, they're all crooks.

26
00:01:17,602 --> 00:01:20,400
- Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
- We're gonna sign it.

27
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:23,200
In fact, George is out with
the woman from NBC right now.

28
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:28,602
So I'm afraid we're gonna
have to pass.

29
00:01:29,814 --> 00:01:32,840
- You're passing?
- Well, it's much too low.

30
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:36,748
Are you and Jerry
in agreement on this?

31
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:40,479
Yeah, we've talked. I believe I can
speak for the both of us on this.

32
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:45,353
You know, because this is your
first show, it's a pretty standard deal.

33
00:01:46,097 --> 00:01:48,565
- Standard?
- Yeah.

34
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,868
Is Ted Danson's deal standard?

35
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:53,094
- Ted Danson?
- You know, the guy from Cheers.

36
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:55,671
Yeah, I know who he is.

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,832
You're not Ted Danson.

38
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:01,941
I didn't say I was Ted Danson.

39
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:05,844
- All right, I'll tell Russell tomorrow.
- You tell Russell.

40
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,914
Oh, before I forget.

41
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:15,690
Cuban cigars.
It's a present from my father.

42
00:02:16,227 --> 00:02:18,354
Do I have to write him
a note or something?

43
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,294
- I'm sure he'd appreciate that.
- What would I say in the note?

44
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:23,866
You're a writer.
You'll think of something.

45
00:02:24,135 --> 00:02:29,835
Oh, yeah. I'm a writer. I forgot.

46
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:32,875
Were you waiting
long at the gate?

47
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:35,308
I don't even know.

48
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,675
Where's that watch
we bought you?

49
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,382
Oh...

50
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:41,542
That's it for this piece of junk.
I've had it.

51
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,279
- Is it the one your parents gave you?
- It never works.

52
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,446
It's being fixed.

53
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:50,060
I got a guarantee on that watch.
Give it to me. I'll take it back.

54
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:52,196
- It's at the jeweler.
- You send me the bill.

55
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:53,591
I'm not sending it.

56
00:02:53,765 --> 00:02:56,233
That watch was a gift.
You shouldn't have to pay for it.

57
00:02:57,335 --> 00:02:59,462
- That's $ 18.50.
- Here, I got it.

58
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,935
What are you talking about?
It's my car. Let me pay.

59
00:03:02,106 --> 00:03:03,539
- No, no, put it away.
- Dad.

60
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,767
- Stop it.
- I have money. I make money.

61
00:03:05,944 --> 00:03:09,744
- Yeah, yeah, you make money.
- You don't think I make money.

62
00:03:09,914 --> 00:03:12,508
- I don't think that.
- You do. That's what you both think.

63
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:14,481
- I'm paying.
- Dad, I'm paying.

64
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,017
- Get out.
- You're not paying.

65
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:18,985
- Jerry, do not do this.
- No, no.

66
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,785
Over my dead body, Jerry.
I'm telling you right now...

67
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,257
...you're not gonna do it.

68
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,490
Boy, you got a lot of stuff here.

69
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:32,995
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Nothing, nothing.

70
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,139
Leave it. What about your back?

71
00:03:35,306 --> 00:03:37,866
- Morty, what are you doing?
- All right, all right.

72
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:39,873
You come here
to see a back specialist...

73
00:03:40,044 --> 00:03:42,535
...and you're lifting heavy suitcases.

74
00:03:42,714 --> 00:03:44,511
Hey, Morty.

75
00:03:45,149 --> 00:03:47,913
Hey, Mr. Kramer.

76
00:03:48,653 --> 00:03:51,383
- Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld.
- Kramer, hi.

77
00:03:52,156 --> 00:03:53,384
What happened to you?

78
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:55,992
Oh, some guy kicked me
in the side of the head.

79
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,728
- What guy?
- Crazy Joe Davola.

80
00:03:58,896 --> 00:04:01,126
- Why?
- Well, I was having this party...

81
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:05,395
...and I didn't invite him,
and then Jerry tipped him off.

82
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:10,800
Why did you tell this guy that
Kramer didn't invite him to his party?

83
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:13,466
I didn't know he wasn't invited.

84
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:16,705
Hey, these are very
comfortable pants.

85
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,179
You know what I paid for these,
Jerry?

86
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,750
- So why did you say anything?
- It was a mistake.

87
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,888
They're good around the house,
and they're good for outside.

88
00:04:25,857 --> 00:04:28,257
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

89
00:04:28,426 --> 00:04:30,519
I was little off last week, huh, Jerry?

90
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:33,994
But the doctor says
it's just a slight concussion.

91
00:04:34,165 --> 00:04:35,894
What's the matter
with this Davola guy?

92
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,728
He's got, like, a chemical imbalance.

93
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,961
- He needs to be on medication.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

94
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:42,572
He's after Jerry now.

95
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,475
- Kramer.
- He's what?

96
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:47,941
- He's joking.
- He's after you?

97
00:04:48,112 --> 00:04:49,340
- No.
- Why's he after you?

98
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:51,106
He's not after me.

99
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:53,842
Morty, do you hear this?
Some crazy guy is after Jerry.

100
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:56,680
- I'll make a few phone calls.
- Who you gonna call?

101
00:04:56,854 --> 00:04:58,151
What are you worried about?

102
00:04:58,322 --> 00:05:00,290
I wanna know what
you did to this guy.

103
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,926
- I didn't do anything.
- You must've done something.

104
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,686
No, he just doesn't like me.

105
00:05:05,163 --> 00:05:08,792
Doesn't like you?
How could anyone not like you?

106
00:05:09,167 --> 00:05:11,897
- I know, it seems impossible.
- Doesn't...

107
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,697
Doesn't like you?
How could that be?

108
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,130
Ma, this may be hard
for you to understand...

109
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:19,504
...but I'm sure there are many people
who do not like me.

110
00:05:19,677 --> 00:05:22,168
Jerry, don't say that.

111
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:24,810
- It's true.
- No, it isn't.

112
00:05:24,982 --> 00:05:28,349
It's not true. You're a wonderful,
wonderful boy.

113
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:31,283
Everybody likes you.
It's impossible not to like you.

114
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,684
Morty?

115
00:05:32,857 --> 00:05:35,792
Maybe some people don't like him.
I can see that.

116
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,357
- Kramer?
- Yeah, I like him.

117
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:42,499
Hey, Jerry, what time you got?

118
00:05:43,835 --> 00:05:46,065
I haven't got my watch on.
It's being fixed.

119
00:05:46,437 --> 00:05:48,268
When are you getting it back?

120
00:05:49,907 --> 00:05:52,375
- Next week.
- Next week?

121
00:05:52,543 --> 00:05:54,875
How come it's taking so long?

122
00:05:57,415 --> 00:05:59,349
I said, how come it's taking so long?

123
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:03,180
I don't know. They're backed up.

124
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,881
Wait a minute.
Where did you take it?

125
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,024
- Where did I take it?
- Yeah.

126
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:14,354
Where did I take it?

127
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:18,629
To that place on Columbus...

128
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:21,795
...and 85th, okay?

129
00:06:21,973 --> 00:06:23,998
What, Jimmy Sherman?

130
00:06:25,943 --> 00:06:27,205
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I know the guy.

131
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:28,606
I take my stuff in there.

132
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,973
I can get your watch back
by tomorrow morning.

133
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:33,777
No, I don't want you
to say anything to him.

134
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:36,010
I'd be happy to.
He's a friend of mine.

135
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:38,212
I'd like to follow
the regular procedures.

136
00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:40,448
I don't want any special treatment.

137
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,526
Hey, I'm gonna get that watch back
for you by tomorrow, buddy.

138
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:47,061
- Bring me the receipt.
- I'll get that too.

139
00:06:51,502 --> 00:06:53,060
Be right back.

140
00:06:57,008 --> 00:07:00,136
Look, there's no watch. I threw it
in the garbage can on the street.

141
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,903
My parents gave it to me,
but I didn't like it.

142
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,207
So don't mention it again, okay?

143
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,782
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

144
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:08,179
Wait, wait...

145
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,410
Well, no...

146
00:07:13,324 --> 00:07:15,292
What was that about?

147
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:17,017
Oh, no...

148
00:07:17,428 --> 00:07:19,988
...he's got my calamine lotion.

149
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:25,632
I told him not to return it.
If he needs it, he should keep it.

150
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:30,001
He's got a thing on his ankle.

151
00:07:32,677 --> 00:07:35,305
How could anyone not like him?

152
00:07:43,454 --> 00:07:46,651
Hi. Morty Seinfeld.
I have a 2:00 appointment.

153
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:49,952
Yes, Mr. Seinfeld.
Would you please fill this out?

154
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:52,857
All this? This whole thing?

155
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,895
It's gonna take me 45 minutes.

156
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,091
I know, it's very long.

157
00:07:59,203 --> 00:08:02,195
Look at this. It's a book.

158
00:08:03,207 --> 00:08:06,233
"Employer's address."
Why do they need this?

159
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:08,008
I never had a back problem...

160
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:10,477
...until that night I slept
on the convertible sofa.

161
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:14,651
- My back was fine.
- Oh, it's not the sofa.

162
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,346
You stick up for that sofa
like I'm criticizing a person.

163
00:08:18,522 --> 00:08:20,615
We got it from Sullivan's.
It's a good store.

164
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:25,285
Well, one day somebody's gonna
sleep on that thing, and we'll get sued.

165
00:08:25,663 --> 00:08:27,563
I hope this doctor
knows what he's doing.

166
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:30,029
Leo says he's the best there is.

167
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:31,566
Leo.

168
00:08:31,736 --> 00:08:33,727
I'm listening to Leo now.

169
00:08:33,905 --> 00:08:37,432
You're lucky he got you this.
You know what the waiting list is?

170
00:08:37,608 --> 00:08:40,475
Well, if he fixes my back,
I'll be happy.

171
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,945
Have you ever had a sexually
transmitted disease?

172
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:46,913
That's it.

173
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:52,081
Here, you got my name, you
got my address. That's enough.

174
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:55,655
Julie, you wanna take him back?

175
00:08:59,764 --> 00:09:02,096
You what? You passed?

176
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:04,598
How could you do that?

177
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:06,794
Jerry, my young friend...

178
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:13,233
...you're so naive.
You are so, so naive.

179
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:15,003
You know about a few things.

180
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,703
You know about comedy...

181
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:19,372
...a little bit about relationships,
some baseball...

182
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,214
...but you're so far out of your element
here, you're embarrassing yourself.

183
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:26,948
Now, listen to me. I'm negotiating.

184
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:30,287
Negotiation.
This is what you do in business.

185
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:32,986
Let me explain to you
what you just did.

186
00:09:33,164 --> 00:09:37,260
There are literally hundreds of people
trying to get pilot deals with them.

187
00:09:37,435 --> 00:09:42,771
They go with maybe five, okay?
If we pass, that's it.

188
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,339
They go to the next show.

189
00:09:45,276 --> 00:09:47,938
I'm scared.

190
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:51,842
Oh, they're not gonna do the show.

191
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:55,542
We're lucky they're even interested
in the idea in the first place.

192
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,985
We got a show about nothing.

193
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,187
With no story.

194
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:04,726
Do you think they're going, "Maybe
we should give those two guys...

195
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:09,730
...who have no experience
and no idea, more money"?

196
00:10:10,768 --> 00:10:16,035
Oh, what are we gonna do?
I'm shaking. I'm shaking.

197
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:18,038
- I think you're wrong.
- We'll just see.

198
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:19,437
- Yes, we will.
- Yes, we will.

199
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,009
- I just said that.
- I know.

200
00:10:21,178 --> 00:10:22,509
- Good for you.
- Good for you.

201
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,376
- Are you repeating everything?
- Are you repeating everything?

202
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:28,017
- Well, George is an idiot.
- Well, George...

203
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:35,422
All right.

204
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,391
All right. Let's go already!

205
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:44,866
They keep you in here a year.
They don't give a damn.

206
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:47,129
I could die in here.

207
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:52,266
Excuse me. Excuse me!
What's going on?

208
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,911
I'm in here 20 minutes.
Can somebody please help me?

209
00:10:56,147 --> 00:10:59,548
- Quiet. Everyone can hear you.
- I've been waiting 20 minutes.

210
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:01,378
Well, the doctor must be busy.

211
00:11:01,552 --> 00:11:04,578
Well, why do they make appointments
for if they can't keep them?

212
00:11:05,156 --> 00:11:08,922
Look, if I did that in my business,
I wouldn't have made a nickel.

213
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:13,059
Hello, Mr. Seinfeld.

214
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:16,231
- I thought you forgot about me.
- We didn't forget.

215
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:19,131
- What's wrong?
- The Velcro.

216
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,602
I can't stand Velcro.
That tearing sound.

217
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:26,265
I used to be in raincoats. I refused
to put that in any of my lines.

218
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:30,505
Okay, Mr. Seinfeld, please come
this way. We need some x-rays.

219
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,550
- Leave all my stuff here?
- Leave it.

220
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:39,919
Oh, hey, by the way...

221
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:43,060
...do you want a box
of Cuban cigars?

222
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:46,491
I smoked one last night.
I got nauseous.

223
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:49,156
No, I don't want them.

224
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:53,896
I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?

225
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:56,130
- Here you go.
- What, cigars?

226
00:11:56,307 --> 00:11:57,740
- Yeah, Cubans.
- Oh, yeah?

227
00:11:57,908 --> 00:12:00,741
Yeah, the kind that Castro smoked.
You can't buy them anywhere.

228
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:02,469
Castro, huh?

229
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:13,780
- Yeah?
- Federal Express.

230
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,950
Federal Express? Come on up.

231
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:20,029
Federal Express?
I'm not expecting a package.

232
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,223
You know what you just did?
You let a burglar in the building.

233
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,996
- You think so?
- Federal Express? Of course.

234
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:28,763
That's the oldest trick in the book.

235
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:31,237
It might not be a burglar.
It could be a murderer.

236
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,504
So you wanna just abolish
all home-package delivery?

237
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:38,045
Yes, it's dangerous.

238
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:40,040
Wait.

239
00:12:45,356 --> 00:12:47,586
- Who is it?
- Federal Express.

240
00:12:47,758 --> 00:12:49,521
Okay.

241
00:13:00,037 --> 00:13:02,369
Hi, Kramer.

242
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,370
Oh, God.
I thought you were in California.

243
00:13:05,543 --> 00:13:08,808
- Well, I came back for you.
- Oh, shut up.

244
00:13:08,979 --> 00:13:10,276
- I missed you.
- Really?

245
00:13:10,447 --> 00:13:12,540
- You really missed me?
- Yeah.

246
00:13:12,716 --> 00:13:14,115
Me too, miss. I miss.

247
00:13:14,285 --> 00:13:16,947
Yeah, big missing
going on around here.

248
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:18,713
Hey, I'm gonna get a match.

249
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:20,720
Oh, God. Whose suitcase is this?

250
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:23,485
My parents'. My father came up
to see a back specialist.

251
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:27,358
Oh, God. It's probably
from sleeping on that sofa.

252
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,528
- Boy, you look really great.
- Yeah.

253
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:33,932
- You lie.
- No, no, you really look great.

254
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,299
So tell us about the trip.
How's Dr. Reston?

255
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:38,134
Oh, he's fine.

256
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:41,176
- Things are good?
- Yeah, you know.

257
00:13:43,881 --> 00:13:45,109
- What?
- Did you see that?

258
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:47,113
Yeah, I saw it.

259
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,880
- What?
- It's a tell. You got a tell.

260
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,217
What tell? What's a tell?

261
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:57,326
When you ask about their relationship
and they touch their face...

262
00:13:57,494 --> 00:13:59,086
...you know it's not going too well.

263
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:01,788
Go ahead. Ask me
how it's going with somebody.

264
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:07,002
- How's it going with Alice?
- Good, going good.

265
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:12,134
The higher up on the face you go,
the worse the relationship is getting.

266
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:16,712
You know, it's like: Pretty good.
Not bad. I gotta get out.

267
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:23,514
- How high did I go?
- You almost did the nose.

268
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:31,651
Are you eating my peanut butter out of
the jar with your disgusting fingers?

269
00:14:32,429 --> 00:14:34,192
This is a sickening display.

270
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:36,829
What, I'm not eating bread now.
I'm off bread.

271
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,629
You're off bread.

272
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,634
- So, what happened? Is it over?
- No, not quite.

273
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:45,639
- Why not?
- He was my psychiatrist, you know.

274
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:48,369
I mean, he knows all my patterns.

275
00:14:48,545 --> 00:14:51,241
He knows in relationships
I always find some reason to leave.

276
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:54,009
So he says, as my doctor,
he can't allow me do this...

277
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,948
...so he's not letting me leave.

278
00:14:58,455 --> 00:15:01,720
- What do you mean, not letting you?
- He has this power over me, okay?

279
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:05,259
He has this way of manipulating
every little word that I say.

280
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:08,125
He's like a Svenjolly.

281
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:11,726
Svengali.

282
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:14,496
- What did I say?
- Svenjolly.

283
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,064
Svenjolly? I did not say, Svenjolly.

284
00:15:18,242 --> 00:15:20,142
- George?
- Svenjolly.

285
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,370
I don't see how
I could've said, Svenjolly.

286
00:15:24,782 --> 00:15:28,115
Maybe he's got, like,
a cheerful mental hold on you.

287
00:15:30,988 --> 00:15:33,684
- I can't find a match anywhere.
- You know what you should do?

288
00:15:33,857 --> 00:15:36,826
Tell this guy you're seeing somebody
else. That's the easiest way.

289
00:15:36,994 --> 00:15:38,723
No, it's not gonna work
with this guy.

290
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,865
You just tell him an old boyfriend's
come back into your life.

291
00:15:42,132 --> 00:15:43,429
I don't think so.

292
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,929
- Nice try.
- Took a shot.

293
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:48,103
This is a good cigar.

294
00:16:01,719 --> 00:16:03,277
So when do I get to see the doctor?

295
00:16:03,454 --> 00:16:06,480
He'll be in with the x-rays
in a few minutes.

296
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:08,625
You can get dressed.

297
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,959
He stole my wallet.
The bum stole my wallet.

298
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,640
My wallet's gone! My wallet's gone!

299
00:16:26,377 --> 00:16:28,504
I had my wallet in my back pocket.
It's gone.

300
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,476
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

301
00:16:30,647 --> 00:16:34,048
I went in to get my x-rays. Somebody
takes my wallet. Is that the operation?

302
00:16:34,318 --> 00:16:37,253
Mr. Seinfeld, I'm Dr. Dembrow.
I've been going over your x-rays.

303
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:40,413
I'm not interested in the x-rays.
I want my money back.

304
00:16:40,591 --> 00:16:43,617
Somebody stole my wallet.
I had $225 in there.

305
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:46,285
- I don't see how that happened.
- Oh, you don't see.

306
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,626
You don't see.
Well, it happened. Believe me.

307
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,132
- What's going on?
- They stole my wallet.

308
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,566
- What?
- Yeah, while I was in getting x-rayed.

309
00:16:54,738 --> 00:16:57,229
All right, Mr. Seinfeld,
I am sorry about your wallet.

310
00:16:57,408 --> 00:16:59,239
Would you like me
to look over the x-rays?

311
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,607
- What kind of joint you running here?
- All right.

312
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,247
Fine.

313
00:17:05,082 --> 00:17:07,107
At least you could've
heard your diagnosis.

314
00:17:07,284 --> 00:17:10,014
I'm not interested in his diagnosis.
He's a bum.

315
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:12,178
You came all the way from Florida
to see him.

316
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:16,357
I wanna know what kind of office this
is where you can't leave your pants.

317
00:17:16,527 --> 00:17:18,324
You tell me.

318
00:17:21,398 --> 00:17:24,731
I'm sorry,
but there's somebody else.

319
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:31,737
Well, it's nothing I planned
on happening, you know.

320
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:34,104
It just kind of happened.

321
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:38,378
- Tell me about him.
- Well, there's not really much to tell.

322
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:41,211
You know, he's just a guy, really.

323
00:17:41,385 --> 00:17:44,946
- Yes, well, I assume he's a guy.
- Right.

324
00:17:45,122 --> 00:17:47,283
And you've known him how long?

325
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:51,350
Years. Many years.

326
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:55,862
We've been close friends, and then
recently, something just, you know...

327
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,830
...happened.

328
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,895
- You mean sexually?
- Yeah, yeah.

329
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:04,631
Sexually.

330
00:18:12,015 --> 00:18:13,505
I think your...

331
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:17,252
Excuse me. Yes?

332
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:19,785
Oh, yes, Bobo.

333
00:18:19,957 --> 00:18:22,255
No, it's just east of Madison.

334
00:18:22,426 --> 00:18:26,795
Around 4 will be fine.
All right, Bobo, see you then.

335
00:18:29,032 --> 00:18:31,364
I'm sorry. Where were we?

336
00:18:31,702 --> 00:18:35,900
Well, I was just telling you
about this other guy.

337
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:39,265
Elaine, do you remember
your dream...

338
00:18:39,443 --> 00:18:42,344
...where you had a sexual
encounter with a Chinese woman?

339
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:48,378
Yeah, yeah.

340
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,909
Elaine, I'm concerned about you.

341
00:18:51,221 --> 00:18:54,520
Oh, no. Don't concern yourself
with me, because I'm good.

342
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:58,957
I'm very good. I mean,
I'm really very, very good.

343
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:00,653
Elaine...

344
00:19:01,298 --> 00:19:03,357
...have you been urinating
a lot again?

345
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:11,438
No.

346
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,940
And how often
have you been seeing...

347
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,405
I'm sorry. What is his name?

348
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,208
- His name?
- Yes, his name.

349
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:22,375
- Well, what's the difference?
- Are you afraid to tell me his name?

350
00:19:22,753 --> 00:19:25,551
No, I just don't really see
how that's relevant.

351
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:29,089
It doesn't matter if you
don't see how. I see how.

352
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,694
His name.

353
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:34,057
I don't even know.
You wanna know his name?

354
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:36,722
I'll tell you his name. His name is...

355
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,561
...Kramer.

356
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:41,866
Kramer.

357
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:44,264
Is that his first name
or his last name?

358
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:48,571
You know, I'm really uncomfortable
talking about this.

359
00:19:48,745 --> 00:19:50,940
- Elaine, I want you to do me a favor.
- What?

360
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:53,906
I want you to tell this young man
to give me a call.

361
00:19:54,084 --> 00:19:57,349
- It's very important that I speak to him.
- Oh, no, no, I can't do that.

362
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:01,015
- You can do it, and you will do it.
- No, I can't.

363
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:03,452
You can, and you will.

364
00:20:04,461 --> 00:20:08,090
Okay. Okay, yeah, I'll have Kramer
give you a call.

365
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,734
So you didn't even let
the doctor treat you?

366
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:14,302
I wouldn't give him the satisfaction.

367
00:20:14,471 --> 00:20:16,530
Why did you leave
your wallet in your pants?

368
00:20:16,707 --> 00:20:19,835
What are you talking about?
What, was I supposed to hide it?

369
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,705
- You could've taken it with you.
- Yeah.

370
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:25,370
I'll be lying on an x-ray table
with my wallet in my mouth.

371
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,912
- Hello.
- Hello.

372
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:29,552
Hi, Uncle Leo.

373
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:33,215
I just spoke to Dr. Dembrow's son.

374
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,654
He said they almost
had to call the police.

375
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:39,690
What? I'm the one who should've
called the police. They stole my wallet.

376
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,889
You know how hard it was for me
to get that appointment for you?

377
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:46,729
You can't just walk in on this guy.
He did me a personal favor.

378
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:49,997
- All right, Leo.
- And you walked out without paying.

379
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:52,835
How was I supposed to pay?
I didn't have my wallet.

380
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:55,478
Well, I hope you send him a check.

381
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:57,910
- What for?
- What for?

382
00:20:58,081 --> 00:21:00,049
This man was nice enough
to see you.

383
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,515
He did me a personal favor.

384
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:06,417
That's the second time you said
personal favor. Why do you say that?

385
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,922
- I said it once.
- Twice.

386
00:21:09,092 --> 00:21:10,753
And Dembrow
doesn't even know you.

387
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:14,192
His son happens
to live on your floor.

388
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:19,602
Leo, where did you get that watch?

389
00:21:20,137 --> 00:21:21,968
You know where I got this?

390
00:21:22,706 --> 00:21:25,698
I found it in the garbage can.

391
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:27,735
It kept terrible time.

392
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:32,007
I brought it over to Jimmy Sherman
right here on 85th and Columbus.

393
00:21:32,182 --> 00:21:35,583
Gave it to me back the next day,
works great.

394
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:40,086
What kind of an idiot throws away
a perfectly good watch?

395
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,725
Doesn't that watch look like
the one that we gave Jerry?

396
00:21:43,293 --> 00:21:46,023
Hey, where's the waiter?
Dad, let's have some red meat.

397
00:21:46,196 --> 00:21:49,131
- Let's live a little.
- Let me see that.

398
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:52,434
Could we continue this
another time?

399
00:21:58,008 --> 00:22:00,203
Don't you hate
"to be continueds" on TV?

400
00:22:00,377 --> 00:22:03,540
It's horrible when you sense the
"to be continued" coming, you know.

401
00:22:03,714 --> 00:22:06,512
You're watching the show.
You're into the story.

402
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:09,208
There's five minutes left,
and you realize:

403
00:22:09,386 --> 00:22:13,846
"Hey, they can't make it.
Timmy's still stuck in the cave.

404
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:16,788
There's no way they wrap this up
in five minutes."

405
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,124
I mean, the whole reason you watch
a TV show is because it ends.

406
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:26,201
If I wanted a long boring story
with no point to it, I have my life.

407
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:30,863
A comedian can't do that, see? I can't
go, "A man walks into a bar with a pig.

408
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,305
Can you come back next week?"
