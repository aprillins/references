1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,111
I've never been any place
there was no coffee.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,511
And people constantly try
to give you coffee.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,558
"Who's having coffee?
Can I get you some coffee?"

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,756
Coffee's one of the only things
you can have...

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,388
...that people continue
to try and give it to you.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,791
Waitresses ask, " Can I fill it up?
Can I warm it up? Can I top it off?"

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,439
You could lift up a manhole cover:

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,034
"We just made a fresh pot.
Would you like some?"

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,828
It has taken over humanity.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,117
There are coffee machines
we have to call "mister."

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,950
"Coffee anyone?"
"Hey, that's Mr. Coffee to you."

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,917
Then I hear this rabbi on television.
I mean, imagine.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,196
I'm really sorry, George.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,319
I wasn't jealous of you.
It was just the whole marriage thing.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,232
You know, I was just
a little surprised.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,039
Why would anyone eat canned fruit?

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,509
I mean, can anybody answer that?

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,877
- What about all the "loser" stuff?
- I don't know where the rabbi got that.

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,989
You know, I never said that.
I said, "I've never seen you looser."

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,870
I could see the can
if you're in the Army.

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,838
But fresh fruit, it's available.
It's there.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,911
It's two aisles over.

23
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,913
Well, scintillating as always.

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,640
- Where you going?
- I'm going shopping with Susan.

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,916
- What kind of shopping?
- Clothes shopping.

26
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,718
- Where you going?
- Ross'.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,757
- That's a nice store.
- It's her uncle's.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,878
- Discount?
- One would hope.

29
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,790
So my friend and I,
we were going to the movies...

30
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,428
...and we stopped off
and bought this café latte.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,556
- Is that Italian coffee?
- Yeah, that's right.

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,836
- Half milk, half coffee?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,034
- You take a sip?
- Yes, I did.

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,872
When you did,
did you notice it was hot?

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,712
Could you sip it
in your normal fashion?

36
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,674
No, I wasn't able to sip it
in my normal fashion.

37
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,712
All right, all right.

38
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,429
You take big sips?

39
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,792
Well, I think I take a normal sip.

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,474
Okay, you take normal sips.
Nothing wrong with that.

41
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,108
- Then what happened?
- Well, you know...

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,477
...they don't allow outside drinks
in the movie theatre...

43
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,790
...so I had to put it in my shirt
and sneak it in.

44
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,269
Yeah, see, they like
to sell their own coffee.

45
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,670
- Is that gonna be a problem?
- Yeah, it's a problem.

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,159
It'll be a problem for them.

47
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,515
It's a clear violation of
your rights as a consumer.

48
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,591
An infringement
on your constitutional rights.

49
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,593
It's outrageous,
egregious, preposterous.

50
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,031
It's definitely preposterous.

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,792
So then what happened?

52
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,351
Well, I was trying to get to my seat,
and I had to step over someone...

53
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,750
...and I kind of got pushed,
and it spilled on me.

54
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,990
- Was there a top on it?
- Yeah.

55
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,628
Did you put the top on,
or did they put it on for you?

56
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,030
- They put the top on.
- And they made the top.

57
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,191
You didn't make the top, did you?

58
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,074
Suzy, I want you to go down
to Java World.

59
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,708
Get me a café latte with a top.

60
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,791
We're gonna run
some tests on that top.

61
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,870
- Have you been to the doctor?
- No. No, I haven't.

62
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,351
Suzy, call Dr. Bison.

63
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,114
Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer.
Tell him it's for me.

64
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,192
- So, what do you think, Mr. Chiles?
- Jackie.

65
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,195
- Jackie. I mean, we got a chance?
- Do we have a chance?

66
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,078
Get me one coffee drinker
on that jury...

67
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,992
...you gonna walk out of there
a rich man.

68
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,195
I don't like it. It's red.
It's too flashy.

69
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,271
Well, you could use a little flash.

70
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,672
All right, don't change me.
Susan, don't change me.

71
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,469
There's a lot of women that would love
to be in your position right now.

72
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,878
Name one.

73
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,632
So did you find anything?

74
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,076
Oh, he is impossible
to shop for, Uncle Ned.

75
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,918
I'm going on vacation to Costa Rica.

76
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,798
Maybe I'll see you
in a couple of weeks.

77
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,076
Excuse me, Mr. Ross.

78
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,715
- See, now, this I don't get.
- What?

79
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,070
- The security guard.
- What about him?

80
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,799
Why does he have to stand?

81
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,390
Because he's a security guard.

82
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,834
I mean, look at him.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,833
He's gotta be on his feet like that
all day? I mean, that's brutal.

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,798
- I'm gonna say something to your uncle.
- George, you just met him.

85
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,871
Don't say anything to him.

86
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,395
Aren't you concerned
about the security guard?

87
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,954
Not really.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,036
She's not concerned
about the security guard.

89
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,349
What kind of person is this?

90
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,437
I'm marrying a person
who doesn't care...

91
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,511
...this man has to stand
eight hours a day...

92
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,159
...when he could easily
be sitting.

93
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,788
All right, George.
What do you think?

94
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,512
- So, what did you do last night?
- Nothing.

95
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,318
I know, but what did you
actually do?

96
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,473
Literally nothing.
I sat in a chair and I stared.

97
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,759
- Wow, that really is nothing.
- I told you.

98
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,674
- Hey.
- Hey.

99
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,034
What are you dressed up for?

100
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,839
I just came from a meeting
with my lawyer.

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,230
- How's that looking?
- I'll tell you how it's looking.

102
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,960
My lawyer says if there's
one coffee drinker on that jury...

103
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,951
...l'm gonna be a rich man.

104
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,476
Oh, that's despicable.

105
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,074
How does he know
how all coffee drinkers will vote?

106
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,676
I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on
that jury, I wouldn't give you a nickel.

107
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,469
Well, you wouldn't be on that jury.
He would've weeded you out.

108
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,357
Frankly, I'm surprised
you're so litigious.

109
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,750
Oh, I can be quite litigious.

110
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,148
Whoever heard of this anyway?

111
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,232
Suing a company
because their coffee is too hot?

112
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,632
- Coffee is supposed to be hot.
- But Jackie says the top was faulty.

113
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,678
Jackie says the top was faulty.

114
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,953
- Hey, Maestro.
- Kramer.

115
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,758
- I'm in here. How's it going?
- Fine.

116
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,638
Hi, Bob.

117
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,792
I'm sorry. Maestro.

118
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,678
Oh, boy. This is a surprise.
Look at you.

119
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,549
I just wanted to drop off
this Chinese balm for your burns.

120
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,393
It's supposed to be great stuff.
It's all herbal.

121
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,473
Oh, Maestro, what are you doing?
You don't have to do this.

122
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,835
- Do you believe this Maestro?
- It's nothing.

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,956
You know, you haven't
been around for a while.

124
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,872
Oh, yeah. I've been
at my house in Tuscany.

125
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,873
Tuscany, huh? You hear that, Jerry?
That's in Italy. Yeah.

126
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,468
I hear it's beautiful there.

127
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,712
Well, if you're thinking
of getting a place there, don't bother.

128
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,189
There's really nothing available.

129
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,790
- Hello.
- Well, hello.

130
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,997
- And who might you be?
- I might be Elaine.

131
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,196
- This is Bob Cobb.
- Maestro.

132
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,036
- Maestro?
- It is my very great pleasure.

133
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,592
- I have to get going.
- I have to be going.

134
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,796
Jinx. Buy me a Coke.

135
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,191
- I love it when that happens.
- I know, I know. That is so...

136
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,191
- Coincidental.
- Yeah.

137
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,112
- Okay, bye, you guys.
- Yeah, yeah.

138
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,998
- Ciao.
- Yeah, see you. Oh, hey.

139
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,436
Thanks for the balm. Yeah.

140
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,030
You know
you hurt the Maestro's feelings.

141
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,794
- Because I didn't call him Maestro?
- That's right.

142
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,235
I feel a little funny
calling somebody Maestro.

143
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,789
- Why?
- It's a stupid thing to be called.

144
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,951
- Jerry, he's a conductor.
- Oh, conductor?

145
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,795
He conducts the Policemen's
Benevolent Association Orchestra.

146
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,712
Well, he's still a conductor.

147
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,711
He sure worked
pretty fast with Elaine.

148
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,189
You should see him do
"Flight of the Bumblebee."

149
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,191
He just...

150
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,519
New shirt?

151
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,314
- Yeah, you like it?
- No. Not particularly.

152
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,959
- Why? The colour?
- Yeah.

153
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,588
- Too flashy?
- Yeah, it's burning my retina.

154
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,238
Susan picked that out
for you, right?

155
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,833
No.

156
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,989
All right, what's it gonna be here?

157
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,593
Let me ask you something.

158
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,671
When you're in a store,
does it bother you...

159
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,434
...that they make the security guard
stand there all day?

160
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,872
No.

161
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,157
See, it didn't bother Susan either.

162
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,719
That's why I'm different.

163
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,758
I can sense
the slightest human suffering.

164
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,955
Are you sensing anything
right now?

165
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,109
Let me just say this.

166
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,510
It's inhumane to make a man stand
on his feet...

167
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,591
...in one spot for eight hours a day.

168
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,637
Why shouldn't he have a chair?

169
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,599
What about criminal activity?
He's gotta be alert.

170
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,194
He can't jump out of the chair?
How long does that take?

171
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,193
Look at this. Here, watch.
Criminals. Boom, I'm up.

172
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,669
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

173
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,949
Maybe they offered him a chair
and he turned it down.

174
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,554
Would you get out of here.
Who's gonna turn down a chair?

175
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,439
I'd be very interested to know
how he felt about all this.

176
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,875
- Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
- I know you will.

177
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,951
Hey, hey. Listen to this.

178
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,792
- Jackie just called.
- Who?

179
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,678
- His lawyer.
- Java World wants to settle.

180
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,398
- What?
- Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.

181
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,913
- Why are they settling?
- They're afraid of bad publicity.

182
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,116
All this because
you spilled coffee on yourself?

183
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,271
Yeah, that's right.

184
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,949
I'm gonna need a coffee here!
Very hot! Boiling!

185
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,274
And then, about four years ago...

186
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,514
...I was on holiday in Tuscany,
and I fell in love with this house.

187
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,432
Are you ready to order?

188
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,673
Gosh, what are you getting, Bob?

189
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,833
Good question.
We'll need a few minutes.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,797
Thanks.

191
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,954
You know, I'm sorry, but...

192
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,554
I didn't mention it earlier, but,
actually, I prefer to be called Maestro.

193
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,714
- Excuse me?
- Well, you know, I am a conductor.

194
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,553
Yeah. So?

195
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,235
I suppose it's okay for Leonard
Bernstein to be called Maestro...

196
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,675
...because he conducted
the New York Philharmonic.

197
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,274
So he gets to be called Maestro
and I don't.

198
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,357
Well, don't you think
that he was probably called Maestro...

199
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,239
...while he was conducting.
Not in social situations.

200
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,550
I mean, his friends
probably just called him Lenny.

201
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,236
I happen to know for a fact that he was
called Maestro in social situations.

202
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,356
I once saw him in a bar,
and somebody said:

203
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,274
"Hello, Maestro, how about a beer?"
Okay? So that's a fact.

204
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,630
Maestro, huh?

205
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,278
Okay.

206
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,153
Maestro.

207
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,635
Jerry! Jerry!

208
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,158
Jerry, my burn, it's gone, look.

209
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,956
- What do you mean?
- I put that Chinese balm on it.

210
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,111
- Look, it healed it.
- So?

211
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,748
So my lawsuit. I'm finished.

212
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,992
- I thought they wanted to settle.
- What happens if they wanna see it?

213
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,990
- Then you're in a lot of trouble.
- Yeah!

214
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,798
- Tired?
- No.

215
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,156
How come no chair?

216
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,593
What?

217
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,718
I couldn't help but notice
that you don't have a chair.

218
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,348
- I don't need a chair.
- I didn't mean to imply you did.

219
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,398
You're obviously
a very well-proportioned individual.

220
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,109
What I was just wondering is...

221
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,631
...have they ever
offered you a chair?

222
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,514
- No.
- Would you like a chair?

223
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,716
I suppose if they gave me one
I'd sit down.

224
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,834
You would, wouldn't you?

225
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
Obviously I'd rather sit,
if that's what you're asking.

226
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,756
- That's exactly my point.
- Who wouldn't?

227
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,992
Because, I tell you, frankly...

228
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,755
...l'd like to walk in here one day
and find you sitting down.

229
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,798
That would give me
a lot of pleasure.

230
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,474
Call me crazy.

231
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,990
You put the balm on?
Who told you to put the balm on?

232
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,390
I didn't tell you to.
Why'd you put the balm on?

233
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,118
You haven't even been
to the doctor.

234
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,191
Let a doctor put a balm on.

235
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,037
- I guess I screwed up, huh, Jackie?
- You're damn right, you screwed up.

236
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,838
Where'd you get
that damn balm anyway?

237
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,752
- The Maestro.
- The who?

238
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,388
- What you talking about, Maestro?
- My friend's a conductor.

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,594
So a maestro tells you
to put a balm on, and you do it?

240
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,432
Well, my stomach was burning.

241
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,909
I'll tell you what this is.
It's a public humiliation.

242
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,356
- I didn't know the balm would work.
- Do you know what a balm is?

243
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,239
You ever seen a balm?
Didn't you read the instructions?

244
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,870
No one can tell what a balm's
gonna do. They're unpredictable.

245
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,154
All right, I'm sorry, Jackie.

246
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,795
- Pull over here, driver. This is it.
- Yeah, get over.

247
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,235
- You have a good time?
- Yeah, he's very interesting.

248
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,994
Did you know that Mozart died
while writing the "Requiem"?

249
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,958
Yeah. Everyone knows that.
It was in Amadeus.

250
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,519
Really?

251
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,029
What about the name?
Did he make you call him Maestro?

252
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,270
- Yeah, I called him Maestro.
- You didn't mind?

253
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,075
Well, I did at first,
but, actually, I kind of got used to it.

254
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,708
Okay, from now on, I want you
to call me Jerry the Great.

255
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,792
- I'm not calling you Jerry the Great.
- Why not? You call him Maestro.

256
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,837
- He is a maestro.
- Well, I'm great.

257
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,116
So you say.

258
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,790
What about his house in Tuscany?
He mention that?

259
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,030
Yeah. I'm invited.

260
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,715
When I told him it was beautiful there,
out of the clear blue sky, he says:

261
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,077
"There's nothing to rent," as if
he doesn't want anyone else there.

262
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,434
Why?

263
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,318
Maybe he's embarrassed
by Americans.

264
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,596
Well, maybe there aren't
any houses to rent there.

265
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,228
In all of Tuscany? I wonder.

266
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,517
I say we offer him $50,000, that's it.
Take it or leave it.

267
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,875
How do we know
how severe the burns are?

268
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,632
Let's have him
examined by a doctor.

269
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,109
Listen, the faster
we dispose of this, the better.

270
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,316
This thing gets into the paper,
it'll kill us.

271
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,631
All right, we'll start with 50,000
and free coffee at all of our stores.

272
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,068
- Yes?
- Mr. Chiles and Mr. Kramer are here.

273
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,798
Send them in.

274
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,313
Gentlemen.

275
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,192
Gentlemen, come in.

276
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,629
Now, we don't want to take up
much of your time.

277
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,472
Let's make this short and sweet.

278
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,230
We're prepared to offer you
all the free coffee you want...

279
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,472
...at any of our stores throughout
North America and Europe, plus...

280
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,471
I'll take it!

281
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,636
"I'll take it"? "I'll take it"?
Who told you to take it?

282
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,233
- Did I tell you to take it?
- No.

283
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,470
The Maestro didn't tell you to.
He wasn't there.

284
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,074
- We were lucky to get anything.
- Free coffee?

285
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,992
- Yeah.
- I don't want free coffee.

286
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,196
It's not hard to get coffee.
I can get it myself.

287
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,157
I wanna know
what came after that "plus."

288
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,390
I didn't hear any "plus."

289
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,074
Twenty years, I've never experienced
anything like this.

290
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,549
Look, Java World.
Hey, listen, I'm getting out here.

291
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,518
I'm gonna get myself
a free café latte.

292
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,032
Hey.

293
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,872
Hi, Maestro.

294
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,991
- "Beethoven's 7th."
- Yeah.

295
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,991
- We were just talking about you.
- Oh, yeah?

296
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,152
The other day, you mentioned
there were no houses in Tuscany.

297
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,833
You didn't find one, did you?

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,754
- No. Not really looking.
- Nor should you.

299
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,629
But are you telling me there's not
one house to rent in all of Tuscany?

300
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,553
The houses are passed down
from generation to generation.

301
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,438
It's very hard.

302
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,479
I can't get a sublet,
a guest room, a cot, nothing?

303
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,519
- It's booked solid.
- It's booked, Jerry.

304
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,477
- How'd you get yours?
- Got lucky.

305
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,633
Come on, Elaine, let's take a ride.
I was about to pop in some Verdi.

306
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,110
Maybe I'll check out France.

307
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,792
Hey, George.
Hey, you believe this guy?

308
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,712
- Who?
- Bob Cobb.

309
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,509
- Bob Cobb?
- You know, the Maestro.

310
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,669
I missed the Maestro?

311
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,515
Get this, he tells me there are no
houses anywhere in Tuscany to rent.

312
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,113
- You renting a house in Tuscany?
- No.

313
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,754
So, what do you care?

314
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,392
I wish I could figure out if this guy's
trying to keep me out of Tuscany.

315
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,791
Of course he is. There's got
to be houses for rent in Tuscany.

316
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,315
- Do you know how big Tuscany is?
- I have no idea.

317
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,994
It's huge.
It's probably like North Dakota.

318
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,197
- Oh, no way it's that big.
- It's a big region.

319
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,316
You know how big
North Dakota is, stupid?

320
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,913
- Why do I bother talking to you?
- There's no gun to your head.

321
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,513
All right.

322
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,189
- So I spoke to the security guard.
- Yeah? And?

323
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,839
It was tough to get a good read...

324
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,197
...but I think if I brought him
a chair, he'd sit.

325
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,677
- So you're gonna get him a chair?
- Yeah. It's a question of what kind.

326
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,274
- Thinking about a barstool.
- That'd give him some height.

327
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,954
Be able to check things out.
With a back or without?

328
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,348
I think I'd go for the back.

329
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,590
- Swivel?
- I suppose he could swivel.

330
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:57,912
- Maybe one of those director's chairs.
- That's kind of a pompous look.

331
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,113
My parents had a kitchen chair
that would've been perfect.

332
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,633
- One of those vinyl things?
- Yes.

333
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,791
Vinyl, yeah. Maybe.

334
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,637
How can I figure out if there's
any places to rent in Tuscany?

335
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,639
Wait a minute.
Poppie's from Tuscany.

336
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,110
- I'm gonna go call him.
- Yeah, good luck.

337
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,991
Hey, I'll meet you outside.

338
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,556
Poppie told me to talk to his cousin.
He lives down in Little Italy.

339
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,597
What do you think
about a rocking chair?

340
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,069
You can't limit my café lattes.
It says so right here.

341
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,437
And no dirty looks. If I want
a café latte, you give me a café latte.

342
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,830
If I have any problems,
I'll get my lawyer down here.

343
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,319
You'll be in big trouble.

344
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,554
Hey, hey, slow down, Eddie.
What's the matter?

345
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,029
They're making faces
because I've had some café lattes.

346
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,272
But I can have as many café lattes
as I want. That was the settlement.

347
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,715
- That's it?
- That's it. You want one, George?

348
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,394
Jerry, you want one?
They're delicious. My pleasure.

349
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,791
You've got to stop it.
You're all hopped up on the caffeine.

350
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,872
- I feel like I'm talking a little faster.
- You're racing.

351
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,951
Well, I got things to do.
See you later. Bye.

352
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,993
Oh, Bob.

353
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,639
Bob.

354
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,470
Maestro.

355
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,472
Maestro.

356
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,393
Excuse me. Can I help you?

357
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,199
No. Just giving a chair
to the security guard.

358
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,191
Did Mr. Ross tell you to do this?

359
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,314
- What's your name?
- Evan Fane.

360
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,516
I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece.

361
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,671
I'll be taking over this whole
place someday...

362
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,876
...so if I were you,
I'd stay on my good side.

363
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,958
I'm terribly sorry. I didn't know.

364
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,917
Innocent mistake.

365
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,038
Well, here you go.
What do you think?

366
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,799
Mr. Ross said this was okay?

367
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,076
I'm his nephew, all right?
Don't worry about it.

368
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,151
Go ahead. Check it out.

369
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,994
Well...

370
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,472
Not bad.

371
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,951
Not bad at all.

372
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,239
Excuse me,
I'm looking for a Mr. Ciccio.

373
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,588
I'm Ciccio.

374
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,877
Poppie sent me
to see you, Mr. Ciccio.

375
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,439
Si, si, Poppie.

376
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:44,199
Did he mention to you why I called?

377
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,280
- The house in Toscana.
- Yeah, right, right.

378
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,112
So is there anything there to rent?

379
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,435
Two million lire.
You give me the check.

380
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,752
- No, I didn't actually want to rent it.
- The keys. Here are the keys.

381
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,832
You give me the check.
Two million lire.

382
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,432
Seventeen-hundred American.

383
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,558
No, see...

384
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,560
...I didn't say that I wanted to rent it.

385
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,395
I was just wondering
if there were houses there to rent.

386
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,518
This one.

387
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,831
It's been a rough couple of weeks.
I really needed to get away.

388
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,592
I told you.

389
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,478
It's paradise.

390
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,154
You were right, Maestro.

391
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,832
Come on, Jerry, this guy's crazy.
Get out.

392
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,673
I'm getting out.
You didn't have to push me.

393
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,033
- How much did you pay that guy?
- Seventy-five thousand lire.

394
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,668
Seventy-five thousand lire?
Are you out of your mind?

395
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,876
Kramer, you don't understand
the conversion rate.

396
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,189
The conversion rates.

397
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,318
- I don't even know why I brought you.
- Nobody put a gun to your head.

398
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,834
- Not bad.
- Yeah.
