1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,955
I feel bad for the silver-medal winner
in the Olympics.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,997
I mean, how do you live with that?

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,516
"How much did you lose by?"
I don't even know.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,878
It was like from now to now.
Now to now. Now, now, now."

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,597
It was... and that was it, I lost.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,671
I trained, I worked out, I exercised.

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,159
I was doing pushups, sit-ups.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,311
I never did anything but exercise
for 20 years.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,391
I flew halfway around the world...

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,390
And that was that.
It was a photo finish.

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,637
Silver, gold.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,199
"If I had a pimple, I would have won."

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,710
Can't believe you write
for the J. Peterman catalogue.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,475
Get this one,
"I packed my rod and reel.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,074
Thirty hours later, lost in the fjord...

16
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,719
...a welcoming smile.

17
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,192
Thank God she spotted the epaulets
on my Norwegian ice-fishing vest."

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,720
This catalogue is all about
how to score in a foreign country.

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,110
- Yeah, what do you do all day?
- Not that much.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,994
I thought that new promotion
was supposed to be more work?

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,309
When the season starts.

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,357
Right now, I sit around
pretending I'm busy.

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,751
- How do you pull that off?
- I always look annoyed.

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,634
When you look annoyed all the time,
people think that you're busy.

25
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,752
Think about it.

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,709
Yeah, you do.

27
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,313
- He looks busy.
- He looks very busy.

28
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,833
I know what I'm doing.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,719
In fact, Mr. Wilhelm gave me
one of those little stress dolls.

30
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,997
All right. Back to work.

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,032
So did you come up
with a stupid story...

32
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,952
...for the Himalayan
walking shoe yet?

33
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,270
No, I'm completely blocked.

34
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,954
In fact, I'm gonna work on it tonight.

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,599
Oh, no.

36
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,753
I can't. I got that marathon runner
coming in tonight.

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,148
What marathon runner?

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,117
You know, this guy, Jean-Paul...?

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,157
I met him when I was
working at Pendant...

40
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,639
...editing a book on running.

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,520
- Oh, wait Jean-Paul Jean-Paul.
- Yes.

42
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,750
He overslept at the Olympics
four years ago...

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,115
...missed the marathon.

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,034
Yeah, that's him.

45
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,156
He's from Trinidad and Tobago,
right?

46
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,437
Yeah, he's
Trinidadian and Tobagan.

47
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,311
How do you oversleep
at the Olympics?

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,112
I know. I know.

49
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,032
It's like the biggest event
of your life.

50
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,997
You'd think you'd have
six alarm clocks...

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,628
...paying off little kids
to come banging on your door.

52
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,279
Well, he was pretty devastated.

53
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,670
This is his first race in three years.

54
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,071
That's a big responsibility
on your hands.

55
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,630
What responsibility?
I don't have any responsibility.

56
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,155
Well, you gotta wake him up.

57
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,152
He'll get up.

58
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,152
- Hi, Judy.
- Hi, Elaine, how are you?

59
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,594
Fine.

60
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,352
- I've seen her in your building.
- Yeah.

61
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,670
- I didn't know she was married.
- She's not.

62
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,031
And the guy just took off.

63
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,675
- Don't say anything.
- Who am I gonna tell?

64
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,274
I know, it's just something
you have to say.

65
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,110
George, we just got
the final budget numbers.

66
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,032
We went over budget
on some of the items...

67
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,714
...but I don't think
there's gonna be a problem.

68
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,472
I'll let you get back to work,
George.

69
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,198
He overslept
and missed the whole race.

70
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,476
- Isn't that amazing?
- I'll tell you what happened.

71
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,154
I bet he got
the a.m. -p.m. mixed up.

72
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,193
My money's on the snooze.

73
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,511
I bet he hit the snooze for an extra five,
and it never came back on.

74
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,436
Imagine, your whole life riding
on an alarm clock.

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,558
Alarm clocks? No, I never use them.
Don't trust them.

76
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,359
- What do you do?
- I have a mental alarm.

77
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,909
I set my head
for quarter to 7...

78
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,469
...and... I get up.

79
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,392
- It always works?
- It never fails.

80
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,152
See, it's based on your body clock.

81
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,676
Your body has an internal mechanism.
It knows what time it is.

82
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:08,593
- What's with the bucket?
- Lomez, he sold me his hot tub.

83
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,512
- Hot tub?
- Yeah, it's in my living room.

84
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,669
I just gotta fill it.

85
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,799
You put a hot tub
in your living room?

86
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,758
It's a beauty. It's got these
high-volume accusage jets...

87
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,471
...oscillating and pulsating,
soothing your every aching muscle.

88
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,837
That water's gonna get
over 120 degrees.

89
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,070
- Is that tolerable?
- Oh, it's tolerable.

90
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,271
Isn't that the same temperature
of the coffee that scalded you?

91
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,192
I think it's a little cooler than that.

92
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,432
He doesn't have any running water?

93
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,511
I don't ask those kind
of questions anymore.

94
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,989
Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.

95
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,515
- Hi, Jean-Paul, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

96
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,116
- Sorry about the Olympics.
- Me too.

97
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,957
Listen, I'm gonna go call work,
see if I can get my deadline extended.

98
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,350
I can't come up
with anything for this thing.

99
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,873
Catalogue-writer's block?

100
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,516
Yeah, that's funny.

101
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,072
So, what happened?

102
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,077
The snooze alarm, wasn't it?

103
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,832
No, man, it wasn't the snooze.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,356
Most people think it was the snooze,
but no, no snooze.

105
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,513
- A.m. -p. m?
- Man, it wasn't the a.m. -p.m.

106
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,033
It was the volume.

107
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,471
- Oh, the volume.
- Yes, the volume.

108
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,154
There was a separate knob
for the radio alarm.

109
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,678
- Oh, separate knob.
- Yeah, separate knob.

110
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,674
Why separate knob!
Why separate knob!

111
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,037
Some people like to have the alarm
a little louder than the radio.

112
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,998
Oh, please, man, please!

113
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,789
It's not gonna happen again.
Not if I have anything to say about it.

114
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,554
Elaine, what's the alarm clock
situation at your house?

115
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,676
- Jerry...
- It's a simple question.

116
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,593
I've got an alarm, okay?

117
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,957
That old one? Didn't I miss a flight
to Cleveland because of that clock?

118
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,872
- Flight to Cleveland?
- It works.

119
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,112
- Elaine.
- It works.

120
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,794
"Singing duo, Captain and..."?

121
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,031
Tennille!

122
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,311
Come on.

123
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,479
George...

124
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,870
...I think you may be
taking work too seriously.

125
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,395
Well, I've got a lot to do.

126
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,516
George, I'll tell you
what I'd like you to do.

127
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,195
I'd like you to drop everything.
I have this fun little assignment.

128
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,430
There are some reps in
from the Houston Astros...

129
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,272
...for talks on
that Interleague Play...

130
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,590
...and I want you
to show them a good time.

131
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,388
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

132
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,073
You're 40 minutes late.

133
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,959
- What happened?
- I got held up.

134
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,839
- Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?
- No.

135
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,230
What? What is the problem?

136
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,436
You said you were gonna be here
a certain time...

137
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,352
...and you weren't.

138
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,272
And this all means what?

139
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,510
It means that a man
has come from very far away...

140
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,432
...to compete in
a very difficult race...

141
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,909
...put his faith in you,
and I'm a little concerned.

142
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,877
- Oh, are you?
- Yes, I am.

143
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,713
Hey, I'm not running
in the marathon, he is.

144
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,949
- Yeah, I know that.
- Yeah.

145
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,634
I've got enough to think about
trying to come up with...

146
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,711
...some crap for that
Himalayan walking shoe.

147
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,110
I've given him a place to stay,
I'll set an alarm...

148
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,748
...but I'm not gonna turn my life
completely upside down.

149
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,833
I'm not talking about upside down,
I'm talking about waking him up.

150
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,952
Hey, Jean-Paul.

151
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,632
Jean-Paul, how was your soak?
A good soak?

152
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,634
Oh, man, very good soak.
The soak of the year.

153
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,197
What's burning?

154
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,912
My muffin.

155
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,154
Shoot.

156
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,878
- What happened?
- I don't know.

157
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,519
I set this thing for 20 seconds.

158
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,399
This was for two minutes, see?

159
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,834
Don't say anything.

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,911
Don't say anything.

161
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,150
You mis-set the timer?

162
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,152
Jean-Paul, it's not
my microwave, okay? Okay?

163
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,550
All right, listen, let's just go.
Come on, Jean-Paul.

164
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,517
- Let's go.
- Okay.

165
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,750
- We'll see you at the race, okay?
- Yeah, I hope so.

166
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,478
Oh, that's cute.

167
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,359
Kramer, I'm telling you,
Elaine doesn't know what she's doing.

168
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,034
I gotta take over
this whole operation.

169
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,237
Jerry, look how tense you are.

170
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,470
You need to take a soak.

171
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,029
I'm not taking a soak...

172
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,351
...in that human bacteria frappe
you got going there.

173
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,353
I'm telling you, it's great.
I opened up all the windows.

174
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,432
The air is cold,
the tub is boiling hot.

175
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,318
It's like Sweden, man.

176
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,994
Sweden.

177
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,310
Oh, yeah.

178
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,273
Till this bastard over here says:

179
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,034
"Let's call the sons of bitches,
go visit them in New York."

180
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,996
Well, we're certainly glad
that you could make it.

181
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,116
I like your organization, George.

182
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,716
We've been talking to a friendly
son of bitch in the front office.

183
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,236
- Wilhelm, I think his name is.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, Mr. Wilhelm.

184
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,791
He told us George Costanza's gonna
be taking us bastards out on the town.

185
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,873
We said, "That son of a bitch doesn't
know what he's got in store for him."

186
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,190
- Finish your drink?
- Oh, yeah, almost. Almost.

187
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,397
Let's get that bastard
to bring us another round, huh?

188
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,873
You a big drinker, George?

189
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,635
Well, maybe not
as much as this bastard.

190
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,319
I can hold my own.

191
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,636
Jean-Paul, I asked you down here
because I am concerned.

192
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,839
Concerned that tomorrow is perhaps
the biggest race of your entire career...

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,834
...and the person with whom
you have chosen to stay is...

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,788
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, get the hell out of there!

195
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,309
Let me put you in a hotel.
You'll be comfortable.

196
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,711
You'll be near the starting line,
and most importantly...

197
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,314
...you'll have a wake-up call,
Jean-Paul.

198
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,199
- A wake-up call.
- Wake-up call?

199
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,429
These people never fail.

200
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,558
They sit in a room
with a big clock all night long...

201
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,915
...just waiting to make that call.

202
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,433
No, I will stay with Elaine,
it would be rude.

203
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,511
Hey, you bastards.

204
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,909
Hey, so how was the meeting?

205
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,310
I really like those sons of bitches.

206
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,391
- Sons of bitches?
- Yeah. That's how they talk.

207
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,835
You know, everyone's a bastard
or a son of a bitch.

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,117
Yeah, it's like, " Boy, that son of a bitch
Boggs can really hit."

209
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,395
- Really?
- Yeah.

210
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,835
That's how they talk
in the major league.

211
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,398
Oh, boy.

212
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,629
Hey.

213
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,833
- How many sweaters you got on?
- Four.

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,037
Could I have a cup of tea,
boiling hot?

215
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,992
What's going on?

216
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,311
I fell asleep in the hot tub,
and the heat pump broke.

217
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,119
Water went down to 58 degrees.

218
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,078
I can't get
my core temperature back up.

219
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,675
Your core temperature?

220
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,600
Here, feel my hand.
Yeah, feel.

221
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,513
This son of a bitch is ice cold.

222
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,989
- Hello?
- Is that you, George?

223
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,718
Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?

224
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,270
Well, listen, you son of a bitch,
you know where we are?

225
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,512
Thirty thousand feet
above your head, you bastard.

226
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,711
What are they doing
letting you on an airplane?

227
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,836
Don't they know
that's against FAA regulation?

228
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,558
Hush up now. I can't hear.

229
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,757
Listen, I want you to send those
agreements the minute you land.

230
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,797
Our boys can't wait
to kick your butts.

231
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,552
When's that bastard
coming to Houston?

232
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,473
Zeke wants to know when you
bastards are coming to Houston?

233
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,428
Hey, you tell that son of a bitch
no Yankee is ever coming to Houston.

234
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,750
Not as long as you bastards
are running things.

235
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,195
Speak up, George, I can't hear you.

236
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,476
You tell that son of a bitch...

237
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,154
...no Yankee
is ever coming to Houston.

238
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,754
Not as long as you bastards
are running things.

239
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,195
- George! Get ahold of yourself.
- Mr. Wilhelm.

240
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,430
What's the matter with you?

241
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,431
It was a cold winter's night
in Timbuktu.

242
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,590
This stinks.

243
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,235
Come on. Come on.

244
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,233
- Hello.
- Hello.

245
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,709
- I'm a friend of Elaine's.
- Oh, hi.

246
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,237
Oh, look at that cute little bastard.

247
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,188
You are mommy's little bastard,
aren't you?

248
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,717
What are you doing
harassing my tenants?

249
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,555
Oh, come on, you son of a bitch,
I'm just trying to be friendly.

250
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,353
All right, that's it. Let's go.

251
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,953
Man, I got a race tomorrow.

252
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,073
- It's like a furnace in here.
- What the hell is going on?

253
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,229
I turned up the heat.

254
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,072
Turn up the heat
in your own apartment.

255
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,753
I'm freezing.

256
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,512
I just need
to get my hot tub running.

257
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,917
I'm waiting for my new heat pump.

258
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,116
Well, what's in this giant box
out in the hall?

259
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,951
- Oh, that must be it.
- It's huge.

260
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,635
Yeah, I got the biggest one they had.
Yeah, it's industrial strength.

261
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,598
Sixteen thousand Btu's.

262
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,679
Hello.

263
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,354
Yeah, I can be there
in 10 minutes.

264
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,989
You can count on me.

265
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,993
- What?
- I got the call.

266
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,151
- Jean-Paul?
- Jean-Paul.

267
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,231
Very lucky to find this hotel,
Jean-Paul.

268
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,072
Man, I just want to get some sleep.

269
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,678
All right.
Let's check out the clock.

270
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,478
Notch good.

271
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,676
6:50.

272
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,116
Volume check.

273
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,792
What kind of music
you wanna wake up to?

274
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,110
- Top 40, Classical?
- Man, whatever.

275
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,919
- How about adult contemporary?
- Fine, adult contemporary.

276
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,435
- Just pick one.
- All right.

277
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,149
We're going with adult contempo.

278
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,632
Now the fail-safe.

279
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,554
The wake-up guy.

280
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,870
Yes, yes, the wake-up guy.

281
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,917
- Front desk.
- Yes, this is room 419.

282
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,152
I'd like a wake-up call
for 6:50 a.m. tomorrow morning.

283
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,548
Yes, sir.

284
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,030
That's room 419, 6:50 a.m.

285
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,668
Four-one-niner.

286
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,078
Yes, I got it, sir.
You only had to say it once.

287
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,516
But it's a very important wake-up call,
and I don't wanna take any chances.

288
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,398
Every wak e-up call I mak e
is important.

289
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,596
You're no more important
than any of our guests.

290
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,228
Well, I don't want to get into
a thing with you here, but...

291
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,075
- Are you through?
- Yeah, I am, but I just...

292
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,796
What is it?

293
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,350
I think I offended the wake-up guy.

294
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,956
- No, no.
- No, no, I did.

295
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,839
- I think he's got it in for me.
- He doesn't have it in for you.

296
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,389
- What if he doesn't call out of spite?
- It is his job.

297
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,878
I'm not comfortable.

298
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,276
For God's sake.

299
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,117
Jean-Paul?

300
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,876
Hey, Jean-Paul?

301
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,512
Jean-Paul?

302
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,878
Jean-Paul?

303
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,996
Oh, man.

304
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,517
- Oh, machine.
- I'm not here. Leave a message.

305
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,037
Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul is missing.
He's alone in the city. Call me back.

306
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,117
- Judy, hi, listen...
- You have got some nerve, Elaine.

307
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,748
I told you about that baby
in confidence.

308
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,754
Oh, I didn't tell anyone.

309
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,116
Well, your friend certainly seemed
to know all about it.

310
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,712
Jerry!

311
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,390
I feel much better here
at my home base, Jean-Paul.

312
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,959
It's a controlled environment.

313
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,997
It's a marathon, you know?
Twenty-six miles.

314
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,309
I need to get some sleep.

315
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,358
Hey, believe me, if I had been
with you there in Barcelona...

316
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,557
...you'd be polishing that medal
right now.

317
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,668
I left a comfortable hotel bed for this.

318
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,990
That wake-up guy was trouble.

319
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,431
All right, I'll be right back.

320
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,268
Man, that thing is noisy.

321
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,274
We're cranking along pretty good.
We're almost up to 80 degrees.

322
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,796
Listen, do me a favour, set your mental
alarm for 6:30 and give me a call.

323
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,518
Okay.

324
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,314
Done.

325
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,389
He's put his faith in you.
He's put his faith in you.

326
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,596
I trust Elaine, she is my friend.

327
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,671
I trust Elaine, she is my friend.

328
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,077
Frankly, I'm a little concerned.

329
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,917
I'm exhausted.

330
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,753
I've been on this street
1000 times.

331
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,150
It's never look ed so strange.

332
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,595
The faces, so cold.

333
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,388
In the distance, a child is crying.

334
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,879
Fatherless.

335
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,429
A bastard child, perhaps.

336
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,836
My back aches.

337
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,560
My heart aches, but my feet...

338
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,710
My feet are resilient.

339
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,119
Thank God I took off my heels
and put on my...

340
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,555
...Himalayan walking shoes!

341
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,271
4:02?

342
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,920
8:47? Jean-Paul!
Wake up, wake up!

343
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,750
Jean-Paul, the electricity went out!
Wake up, wake up, we've gotta go!

344
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,150
- It's 8:47!
- 8:47?

345
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,677
Come on. Just put your clothes on.
You'll get dressed in the car.

346
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,551
Idiot, I trusted you!

347
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,030
Kramer, what happened?
The electricity went out.

348
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,589
Yeah, the heat pump
blew all the fuses.

349
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,757
What happened to your mental alarm?

350
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,992
Well, I guess I hit the snooze.

351
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,951
Make way. Watch out.
I've got a runner here.

352
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,269
Get out of the way.

353
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,996
Make way, make way.
Make way, he's a contender.

354
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,072
- Hey, hold it.
- I'm late, man. I'm in the race.

355
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,639
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, Jerry.

356
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,836
You're a wonderful driver.
Fantastic route, man.

357
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,991
All right, go.
It's a race. Come on.

358
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,278
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes, George, come in, come in.

359
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,795
Word has it you've been
cracking under the pressure.

360
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,951
Can't cope, can't stand the heat.
Spit the bit.

361
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,759
Mr. Steinbrenner, I can explain...

362
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,115
We all get a little cuckoo.
I used to be like you.

363
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,113
Berating personnel, calling managers
on the field during a game.

364
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,840
Threatening to move the team
to New Jersey to upset people.

365
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,194
Then I found a way to relax.

366
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,112
I've got two words
to say to you, George.

367
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,838
Hot tub.

368
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,790
I'm telling you, I never told
anyone about that baby.

369
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,473
I never even went near your building.

370
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,598
- Then how did she find out, Jerry?
- You should check with the rabbi.

371
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,993
- You want some hot tea?
- Oh, no, thank you.

372
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,037
Oh, there's some runners.
Here they come.

373
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,991
There's Jean-Paul.
He's out front.

374
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,234
- He's leading! Go, Jean-Paul!
- Yeah!

375
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,515
Come on!

376
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,717
- One mile to go, Jean-Paul.
- Go, Jean-Paul!

377
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,956
How are you enjoying it, George?
Melts that tension away, doesn't it?

378
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,714
You gotta get that jet
on the good spot.

379
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,189
Yes, that feels good.
Yes, that's real good.

380
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,078
Yeah, that's where I keep
all my tension.

381
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,514
Right under that chicken bone.

382
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,513
I get my wife to stick her thumb
right in there like a screwdriver.

383
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,238
The Phillips head, not the flat one.

384
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,311
Oh, God, those flat ones
frustrate me.

385
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,597
You got it in, but it slips out.
Put it in again, it slips out again.

386
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,274
- You a single man, George?
- Well, I just recently...

387
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,670
You wanna get something wild
going on in your life...

388
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,512
...get a girl and
bring her in one of these.

389
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,318
It's like four shots of Wild Turkey.

390
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,198
She'll think you're Hopalong Cassidy.

391
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,271
Terrible about that Mickey Mantle,
wasn't it?

392
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,318
You know, we used to talk.
I don't think he liked me very much.
