1
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:05,472
There's no easy way
to break up.

2
00:00:05,646 --> 00:00:07,773
When you start dating,
they ought to give you...

3
00:00:07,948 --> 00:00:09,745
..."Get out of Relationship Free"
cards.

4
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:12,681
You know what I mean? So you
could just go up to the person...

5
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:14,445
...and go, "Here you go. I'm sorry.

6
00:00:14,622 --> 00:00:17,147
I'll grab the tennis racket.
Don't even bother to get up.

7
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:19,315
Have a good one. Sorry."

8
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:22,462
Which is fine, unless the person
you're in the relationship with...

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,031
...has a "Eight More Months of Guilt,
Torture and Pain" card.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,661
"Hold it. I got a little something
for you."

11
00:00:34,642 --> 00:00:35,973
- We're dead.
- We're not dead.

12
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:37,576
- We are dead.
- Come on.

13
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:39,679
We got all day tomorrow
to think of a story.

14
00:00:39,847 --> 00:00:42,577
All day tomorrow? We had a month
to come up with something.

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,377
We didn't do anything.

16
00:00:44,652 --> 00:00:46,517
So we'll do it tomorrow.

17
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:49,119
Let me ask you: when's the last time
you went skiing?

18
00:00:49,557 --> 00:00:50,785
About six years ago.

19
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:54,689
I think you can take the lift ticket
off your jacket now.

20
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,423
Women like skiers.

21
00:00:57,598 --> 00:01:00,123
So what? You can't meet anybody.
You're with Susan.

22
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:03,203
Yeah. Right.

23
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:05,762
See those two women over there?

24
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,034
I almost dated the one on the right.
She's in the closet business.

25
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:11,074
Closet business?

26
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:13,975
- What's the closet business?
- What is it your business?

27
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:17,816
- I'm interested.
- She reorganizes your closet...

28
00:01:17,985 --> 00:01:21,045
...and shows you how to maximize
your closet space.

29
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:22,449
She looked into my closet.

30
00:01:22,856 --> 00:01:25,552
You thought she was good-looking.
This was a way to meet her.

31
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:28,660
- Yeah.
- Yeah. So, what happened?

32
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,024
She mentioned she had
a boyfriend. Then it hit me:

33
00:01:31,198 --> 00:01:33,689
What do I need
more closet space for?

34
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:37,732
- Hi, Marla.
- Jerry.

35
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:39,133
- George, Marla.
- Marla.

36
00:01:39,306 --> 00:01:40,967
George. Jerry, Stacy.

37
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:42,665
- Stacy. George, Stacy.
- Jerry.

38
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:44,401
- Stacy.
- George.

39
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,710
George.

40
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:51,851
Jerry, Marla. Stacy.

41
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:58,984
- So, how was your trip to Berlin?
- Trip to Berlin?

42
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,252
Remember, that's why you
put off the closets.

43
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:02,952
You said you were going to Berlin.

44
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,064
Oh, right, right.

45
00:02:05,232 --> 00:02:07,894
The Wall had just come down.
You told me you wanted to be...

46
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:09,296
...part of the celebration.

47
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,735
Yes, yes, I did, but you know,
I was watching it on CNN...

48
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:17,502
...and they covered it so well, I thought,
why knock my brains out?

49
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:19,202
You know, my boyfriend went.

50
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,644
- Really?
- Yes, I told him all about you going...

51
00:02:21,815 --> 00:02:24,045
...and he got all excited
and decided to go.

52
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:26,948
- Oh, did he like it?
- I don't know. He never came back.

53
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:30,390
Anyway, we met with NBC
about a month ago, and they...

54
00:02:30,557 --> 00:02:33,082
...gave us the green light
to go ahead and write a pilot.

55
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,989
We got a big meeting
with them tomorrow.

56
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:37,460
They gotta approve the story
before we can write it.

57
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:42,632
Wow. What a great job. A writer.

58
00:02:42,803 --> 00:02:45,499
Not a bad way to earn a buck.

59
00:02:45,673 --> 00:02:47,004
Sounds great.

60
00:02:47,174 --> 00:02:49,142
Well, I'll tell you, Stacy...

61
00:02:49,309 --> 00:02:51,777
...it's a lot of hard work.

62
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:54,470
But it comes fairly easy to me.

63
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:58,580
Some people write symphonies.
This is my gift.

64
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:07,160
- So you gonna go out with her?
- I might.

65
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:10,188
- What about Susan?
- What? I'm not married.

66
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:12,525
I'm not allowed to go out
with somebody else?

67
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,133
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

68
00:03:14,301 --> 00:03:16,394
- On many factors.
- Like what?

69
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,698
Well, how long
you've been seeing her.

70
00:03:19,873 --> 00:03:22,433
What's your phone-call frequency?
Are you on a daily?

71
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:25,578
No. Semi-daily. Four,
five times a week.

72
00:03:25,746 --> 00:03:28,510
Saturday nights, do you ask her out,
or is the date implied?

73
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,140
- Implied.
- She got anything...

74
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:32,546
...in your medicine cabinet?

75
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:35,587
Might be some moisturizer.

76
00:03:37,257 --> 00:03:39,191
Let me ask you this:

77
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,123
Is there any Tampax in your house?

78
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:49,099
Yeah.

79
00:03:49,903 --> 00:03:51,632
- I'll tell you what you got here.
- Yeah?

80
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:53,033
You got a girlfriend.

81
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:56,267
Oh, no, no. What...?
Are you sure, a girlfriend?

82
00:03:56,443 --> 00:03:59,435
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily,
with Tampax in his house...

83
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:02,013
...and an implied date
on Saturday night.

84
00:04:02,182 --> 00:04:05,640
- I would like to help you out, but...
- Do you believe my luck?

85
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:07,878
The first time I have a good answer to...

86
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:10,046
..."What do you do?"
and I have a girlfriend.

87
00:04:10,557 --> 00:04:12,889
You don't need a girlfriend
when you can answer that.

88
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,187
That's what you say
in order to get girlfriends.

89
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:19,389
Once you can get girlfriends,
you just want more girlfriends.

90
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:22,660
You're gonna make
a very good father someday.

91
00:04:23,203 --> 00:04:25,501
Well, it's not fair, Jerry.
It's just not fair.

92
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:27,537
That's it. I'm getting out
of this thing.

93
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:30,003
Break up with her.
But you know what this means.

94
00:04:30,177 --> 00:04:32,304
- No, what?
- The script, the pilot, the TV show.

95
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,106
- That's all over.
- What do you mean?

96
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:36,272
Figure it out. She's one
of the executives...

97
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:39,476
...that's gonna make the decision
whether or not they pick up the show.

98
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:41,018
She's one of our biggest fans.

99
00:04:41,789 --> 00:04:43,780
You drop her, you think
they're gonna pick us up?

100
00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:47,484
Oh, right. Oh, no! Man.

101
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:50,096
You know, it's a very
interesting situation.

102
00:04:50,264 --> 00:04:52,960
Here you have a job that could
help you get girls.

103
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:54,998
But you also have a relationship.

104
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,967
But if you get rid of the
relationship so you can get girls...

105
00:04:58,138 --> 00:05:00,003
...you lose the job.

106
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:04,100
- You see the irony?
- Yeah, yeah. I see the...

107
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:06,709
All right, what about this?

108
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,212
What if I could find some way
to break up with her...

109
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:12,216
...so that she'll still like me,
and it doesn't affect the deal?

110
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:14,013
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait. Hear me out.

111
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,713
Hear me out. Don't dismiss this.
You're quick to dismiss.

112
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,619
Don't dismiss.

113
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,124
She's got a big crush on
David Letterman. I mean, a big crush.

114
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:24,787
She talks about him all the time.

115
00:05:25,465 --> 00:05:28,059
Suppose I go up to
David Letterman.

116
00:05:28,235 --> 00:05:31,932
He works at NBC. I work at NBC.

117
00:05:32,105 --> 00:05:33,538
I explain my situation.

118
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:36,767
He agrees to meet her. They go out.
They fall madly in love...

119
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:39,845
...and she dumps me
for David Letterman.

120
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,877
- This is your plan?
- No, no, I'm just thinking.

121
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:46,246
I don't think you are.

122
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,318
Well, let me tell you what I see.

123
00:05:55,562 --> 00:05:58,326
Please. And be brutal.
I have no closet sensitivity.

124
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:03,598
- Are you very fussy about your pants?
- I don't think I am.

125
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,328
Because I have a very radical idea.

126
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:07,200
- Can you handle it?
- Try me.

127
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,700
Here's what I'm proposing.
We'll eliminate all this.

128
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:15,838
The hangers, the bar, the shelves, and
in its place, install a series of hooks.

129
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:18,083
We'll put everything on hooks.

130
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,913
- Everything?
- Everything.

131
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:23,181
The shirts, pants,
sports jackets, pajamas.

132
00:06:23,357 --> 00:06:25,848
We can get 80 hooks on here.

133
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:28,024
You're quite mad, you know.

134
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:34,030
Oh, I don't believe this.

135
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:36,263
Hey. Well, what are you doing?

136
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:38,165
I'm watching
The Bold and the Beautiful.

137
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:39,896
- No.
- Wait, wait.

138
00:06:40,073 --> 00:06:41,802
- This is not a good time.
- Five minutes.

139
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:43,806
What did you give your TV
to George for?

140
00:06:43,977 --> 00:06:47,435
Because I've been watching too much.
It was an addiction. I couldn't stop.

141
00:06:47,614 --> 00:06:49,411
It was destroying my brain cells.

142
00:06:50,784 --> 00:06:52,615
Yeah, but now you're in here
all the time.

143
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:54,048
Well... Whoa.

144
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:55,620
- Marla, Kramer.
- Hello.

145
00:06:58,392 --> 00:07:01,384
- Go out. It's nice out.
- There's nothing out there for me.

146
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:03,461
- There's weather.
- I don't need weather.

147
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,927
Weather doesn't do it for me.

148
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:07,032
I'm telling George to give you
your TV back.

149
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,828
No, no. I don't want it back.

150
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:12,062
Are you gonna watch
the Knick game tonight?

151
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:14,230
- I don't know.
- Will you tape it?

152
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:17,673
- Kramer.
- Oh, yeah.

153
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:27,443
So your boyfriend never
came back from Berlin.

154
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:30,146
- Never came back.
- Oh, you must have been devastated...

155
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,655
...being left for a wall.

156
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:33,122
Well...

157
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,425
...it was about to end anyway.

158
00:07:35,595 --> 00:07:38,223
There was this problem.

159
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:40,457
Excuse me one second.

160
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:41,862
- Yeah.
- It's me.

161
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:43,866
Come on up.

162
00:07:44,371 --> 00:07:46,305
That's Elaine. She's just
a friend of mine.

163
00:07:46,473 --> 00:07:48,270
I don't know what
she's doing here now.

164
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,342
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,138
- What?
- I didn't get it.

166
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:58,982
So you were saying
there was this problem.

167
00:07:59,152 --> 00:08:01,712
Well, he wanted me
to move in with him.

168
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:03,913
- Snapple?
- No, thanks.

169
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:08,616
- Go on.
- Well, I wouldn't move in, because...

170
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:10,786
- Yes?
- Well, because...

171
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:14,422
- Yeah?
- Well, because I'm a...

172
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:16,034
...virgin.

173
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,962
Hello.

174
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:21,906
Hi. Marla, Elaine.

175
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:23,736
Sorry, I didn't know
you had company.

176
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,004
- I wanted to return your tape.
- Oh, thanks a lot. Two weeks late.

177
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,980
Now it cost me $35 to see Havana.

178
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,979
I'm sorry. I really am.
I just kept forgetting.

179
00:08:36,156 --> 00:08:38,147
- I should be going.
- No, no, no. I'm leaving.

180
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:39,883
I like that thing in your hair.

181
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,652
Yeah? This woman
was selling them...

182
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:44,023
...at this crazy party
I was at last night.

183
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:46,192
You'll appreciate this. Snapple?

184
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:48,163
No, thanks.

185
00:08:49,603 --> 00:08:52,163
I was talking to this guy,
and I just happened to throw...

186
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:53,636
...my purse on the sofa.

187
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:57,436
And my diaphragm goes flying out.

188
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,277
So I just froze, you know:

189
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,078
Staring at my diaphragm, you know?
It's just lying there.

190
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:08,244
So this woman who sold me
this hair thing...

191
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:11,050
...she grabbed it before
the guy noticed, so I mean...

192
00:09:11,224 --> 00:09:13,454
...big deal, right?

193
00:09:13,627 --> 00:09:16,323
So I carry around my diaphragm.
Who doesn't?

194
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:18,487
I mean, like, it's a big, big secret...

195
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:20,690
...that women carry around
their diaphragms.

196
00:09:22,235 --> 00:09:24,032
You never know when
you're gonna need it.

197
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:32,707
I should be going.

198
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,815
- So we'll talk about the hooks then.
- Yes.

199
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:42,887
- What, was it something I said?
- She's a virgin. She just told me.

200
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:46,719
- Well, I didn't know.
- Well, it's not like spotting a toupee.

201
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:52,893
Well, you think I should
say something?

202
00:09:53,066 --> 00:09:54,658
Should I say something, apologize?

203
00:09:54,835 --> 00:09:56,996
- Was I being anti-virgin?
- No, no.

204
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,365
- I mean...
- Because I'm not anti-virgin.

205
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:03,202
- I'm gonna... I'll be right back.
- Don't... Elaine. Elaine.

206
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:05,537
- Yeah?
- It's George.

207
00:10:06,713 --> 00:10:09,546
- She's a virgin?
- A virgin.

208
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:12,779
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

209
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:16,286
I'm very attracted to her.
That accent is so sexy.

210
00:10:16,456 --> 00:10:18,788
I don't think I could do it.

211
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,757
They always remember
the first time.

212
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:24,590
I don't wanna be remembered.
I wanna be forgotten.

213
00:10:25,265 --> 00:10:28,063
You need a little pioneer spirit.
You don't have any of that...

214
00:10:28,235 --> 00:10:30,100
...Lewis and Clark in you.

215
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:34,031
You know, sometimes those guys
don't make it back.

216
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:39,002
- I'm really hungry.
- Yeah, me too.

217
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,340
We gotta get something.
I don't wanna go...

218
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,346
...on an empty stomach.
Let's get Chinese.

219
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,213
- Wanna order?
- All right, then we gotta get work done.

220
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:49,378
Let me just call Kramer.
See if he wants anything.

221
00:10:50,457 --> 00:10:52,220
Hey. We're ordering Chinese food.

222
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:54,189
If you want anything,
let me know what...

223
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:57,524
...and I'll order it...

224
00:10:57,697 --> 00:10:59,790
...for you.

225
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,991
- I'm in. Let's go for it.
- All right. What do you want?

226
00:11:03,303 --> 00:11:04,634
- I don't care.
- All right.

227
00:11:04,804 --> 00:11:06,795
Why don't we get a couple of
dishes and share.

228
00:11:06,973 --> 00:11:08,463
- All right.
- What are you getting?

229
00:11:08,775 --> 00:11:11,175
- I think I'm gonna get a chow fun.
- What's a chow fun?

230
00:11:11,344 --> 00:11:13,141
It's a broad noodle.

231
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:16,476
- What do you mean "a broad noodle"?
- It's a big, flat noodle.

232
00:11:16,783 --> 00:11:19,183
Well, I don't want a big, flat noodle.

233
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:23,012
- What kind of noodle do you want?
- Who says I want a noodle?

234
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:26,557
I'm getting the chow fun.
You don't have to have any.

235
00:11:26,726 --> 00:11:29,422
I'll get the pea pods, and you can't
have any of my pea pods.

236
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:32,888
- Fine.
- And get extra MSG.

237
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:41,500
Look, Marla, this whole sex thing
is totally overrated.

238
00:11:42,075 --> 00:11:44,305
Now, the one thing
you've gotta be ready for...

239
00:11:44,477 --> 00:11:48,846
...is how the man changes into
a completely different person...

240
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:50,505
...five seconds after it's over.

241
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,644
I mean, something happens
to their personality.

242
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,947
It's really quite astounding. It's like...

243
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:59,683
...they committed a crime and wanna
flee the scene before police get there.

244
00:12:01,228 --> 00:12:03,719
- So they just leave?
- Yeah. Pretty much, yeah.

245
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:08,527
Well, the smart ones start working
on their getaway stories during dinner.

246
00:12:08,702 --> 00:12:11,296
How, you know, they gotta
get up early tomorrow.

247
00:12:11,471 --> 00:12:13,336
It's always about being up early.

248
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:15,371
They all turn into farmers suddenly.

249
00:12:16,743 --> 00:12:19,109
It must be really good
to put up with all that.

250
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,877
Let's go. We don't have time
before the meeting.

251
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:27,485
The food. What happened to Ping?

252
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:30,122
Don't worry, he'll be here.
Look, we only got two hours.

253
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,851
We need to come up with one good
idea, we can get through this meeting.

254
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:36,286
There's your food.

255
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:38,055
Hey, what about this?

256
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:41,325
I'm in a car accident.
The motorist is uninsured.

257
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:43,230
- You with me?
- Yeah.

258
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,199
My car's totaled.

259
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:47,636
It's all his fault. Now, he has
absolutely no money.

260
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:50,105
There is no way
that he could pay me.

261
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:52,507
So the judge decrees...

262
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,271
...that he becomes my butler.

263
00:12:55,882 --> 00:12:57,474
- Your butler?
- Right.

264
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,677
He cooks my food, cleans my house,
does my shopping, there you go.

265
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:02,446
That's your program.

266
00:13:03,156 --> 00:13:04,418
- What about me?
- Don't worry.

267
00:13:04,591 --> 00:13:06,616
We find something for you.

268
00:13:08,995 --> 00:13:11,395
That's the stupidest idea
I ever heard.

269
00:13:11,564 --> 00:13:14,624
Sentenced to be a butler.

270
00:13:15,735 --> 00:13:17,999
- Ping, what happened?
- There was an accident.

271
00:13:18,171 --> 00:13:19,934
Head hurts.

272
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:23,837
- Head really hurts.
- What happened?

273
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:27,212
Marla and I went out for coffee,
and I was crossing the street...

274
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,349
...and he was biking towards me,
so I got out of the way in time...

275
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:32,644
...but he ran into a parked car,
hit his head...

276
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:34,150
...and everything went flying.

277
00:13:34,321 --> 00:13:36,448
Something happened to the food?

278
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:38,422
Could only save one bag.

279
00:13:38,591 --> 00:13:40,650
Should I call an ambulance?
Wanna see a doctor?

280
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,590
I'll get some ice.

281
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:45,492
The pea pods? All you saved
was the pea pods?

282
00:13:45,932 --> 00:13:47,524
- Hey, you got the food?
- Yeah, here.

283
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,601
Man, what took you so long?
Hey, Ping.

284
00:13:49,803 --> 00:13:51,862
- Kramer.
- Yeah.

285
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,800
- Where's yours?
- He dropped it.

286
00:13:54,974 --> 00:13:57,875
Oh, that's too bad.

287
00:13:58,044 --> 00:14:01,013
You should slow down, you know.
It's dangerous to go that fast.

288
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:03,376
No, no, I have green light.
You jaywalk.

289
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,484
- Are you watching Oprah?
- I did not jaywalk.

290
00:14:05,652 --> 00:14:07,017
You're giving him back that TV.

291
00:14:07,187 --> 00:14:08,916
- Yes, you jaywalk.
- No, I don't want it.

292
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:11,023
Jaywalker. I can slap a suit on you.

293
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:12,419
- What?
- We've got work to do.

294
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:15,060
- What about the meeting?
- An hour with Patrick Swayze.

295
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,725
A month and a half we had.
We did nothing.

296
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:25,462
We put it off until today.
Then we couldn't do anything...

297
00:14:25,638 --> 00:14:27,833
...because Elaine runs
to apologize to a virgin...

298
00:14:28,007 --> 00:14:31,443
...crosses against the light and
knocks over a Chinese delivery boy.

299
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:34,409
And now we're gonna go make
fools of ourselves. We got nothing.

300
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:38,142
You're not even in show business.
I got a reputation.

301
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:40,843
You're dragging me into
the sewer with you.

302
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,215
I've been on TV, buddy boy.

303
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:47,588
You know how fast word spreads
in show business? Just like that:

304
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,889
One bad impression,
you're out of the business!

305
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:53,065
Let's postpone it.
Let's get out of here.

306
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,564
What? They know we're here.

307
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:58,397
I'll fake an illness. My back!
My back! I can't move my back!

308
00:14:58,571 --> 00:14:59,936
No, no. Would you get up?

309
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:02,438
- I could do this, Jerry.
- No.

310
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:05,100
All right, I'll tell them
that my sister died.

311
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:07,405
My poor sister died.

312
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,378
She was standing on the street,
and then she was laughing...

313
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,984
...and then they shot her!

314
00:15:13,153 --> 00:15:15,280
That's the kind of a sick city
we're living in!

315
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,286
They shoot you for laughing!

316
00:15:17,457 --> 00:15:20,119
I must go and comfort my poor family.
Jerry, come on.

317
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:23,729
Take me home so I can comfort my...
My poor family.

318
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,857
- What?
- That's David Letterman.

319
00:15:26,032 --> 00:15:27,829
I just saw David Letterman walk by.

320
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:30,961
Be right back.

321
00:15:31,137 --> 00:15:32,866
Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready
for you now.

322
00:15:36,609 --> 00:15:40,739
Yes, I was very wise
to hitch my wagon to his star.

323
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:46,918
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hi.

324
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:48,610
How you doing?
Nice to see you all.

325
00:15:48,788 --> 00:15:51,882
- Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kirson.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

326
00:15:52,058 --> 00:15:54,458
- Where's Russell?
- He had to go to L.A.

327
00:15:54,627 --> 00:15:56,356
There's a problem on the set
at Blossom.

328
00:15:56,696 --> 00:16:00,530
Oh, poor Blossom.

329
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,600
Anyway, he asked me
to sit in for him.

330
00:16:03,369 --> 00:16:04,358
Where's George?

331
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:06,437
He ran to say something
to David Letterman.

332
00:16:06,673 --> 00:16:09,369
- David Letterman's on the floor?
- Yeah, he just walked by.

333
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:14,311
I think we should
get started, anyway.

334
00:16:14,581 --> 00:16:16,549
Yeah. Good idea.

335
00:16:16,816 --> 00:16:18,943
- So how are you guys coming along?
- Good. Good.

336
00:16:19,118 --> 00:16:21,348
We've got a number of ideas.

337
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:22,886
Good.

338
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,354
Have you been to
a Chinese restaurant...

339
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:30,291
...and they say five minutes
for a table, and you wind up...

340
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,896
...waiting there for 30 minutes?

341
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:36,058
Well, we thought it would be
very funny...

342
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:37,863
...to do an entire show...

343
00:16:38,037 --> 00:16:40,369
...where all you're doing
is waiting for the table.

344
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:46,244
Because we've all
been in that situation.

345
00:16:47,981 --> 00:16:51,348
You know, you're... You're waiting,
and you're hungry...

346
00:16:51,518 --> 00:16:54,510
...and you bump into somebody
you know.

347
00:16:59,058 --> 00:17:02,050
- When is Russell coming back?
- So that's the idea?

348
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:05,057
Well, no. That's one.

349
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:06,493
We have many others.

350
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,327
We have an idea where...

351
00:17:10,403 --> 00:17:13,998
l... I get into an accident with a guy
who has no insurance...

352
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:16,539
...and the judge sentences him
to be my butler.

353
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:22,306
You know, and he cooks.
He has to cook for me.

354
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:24,507
And cleans my house...

355
00:17:24,684 --> 00:17:26,845
...and he's doing my shopping,
you know.

356
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,347
And I'm walking around with
one of those big neck-collar things.

357
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:34,383
Those collars are funny.

358
00:17:34,561 --> 00:17:37,621
You see somebody in one of those,
you start laughing immediately.

359
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:40,895
Are you telling them
the butler story?

360
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:43,331
Is that beautiful or what?

361
00:17:43,503 --> 00:17:45,027
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

362
00:17:45,405 --> 00:17:47,032
Russell?

363
00:17:48,474 --> 00:17:50,533
- I'm Rita Kirson.
- Oh, Rita.

364
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,371
Hey, Mr. Schirmack. How are you?

365
00:17:52,545 --> 00:17:56,072
Good to see you, Stu and Jay.
Always a pleasure. Hi, sweetie.

366
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:58,774
Yeah, yeah, that butler idea,
that's beautiful, isn't it?

367
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,442
Is that a killer?

368
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,850
- I thought I was getting the butler.
- Don't worry.

369
00:18:03,022 --> 00:18:04,455
We'll find something for you.

370
00:18:13,032 --> 00:18:16,433
So Letterman didn't
spark to your idea, huh?

371
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:19,203
He said there was nothing
he could do and next time...

372
00:18:19,372 --> 00:18:21,932
...I should probably break
the Prozacs in half.

373
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:24,469
Hey, wanna hold it down.
I'm watching JEOPARD Y!

374
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:27,078
Would you give him back the TV?

375
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,575
Oh, by the way, Susan called for you
a minute ago.

376
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:32,684
I'll bet they're probably doing
somersaults about us over there.

377
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:35,844
You think they get butler stories
like that every day?

378
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:41,722
Who is Joseph Cotten? Giddyup.

379
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:44,422
- Hello?
- Yeah, hi, it's me. It's Georgie boy.

380
00:18:44,597 --> 00:18:46,827
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

381
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,093
What's going on? I'll tell you
what's going on.

382
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:51,031
I'm fired.

383
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:52,432
Fired, why?

384
00:18:52,605 --> 00:18:54,038
Because you kissed me.

385
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:56,402
You kissed me, you stupid idiot.

386
00:18:56,576 --> 00:18:59,511
Rita called Russell, and he fired me
over the phone.

387
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,010
What is pi?

388
00:19:02,181 --> 00:19:04,547
Giddyup again. I'm killing, man.

389
00:19:04,984 --> 00:19:07,316
But I didn't... I had no idea...
I didn't realize.

390
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:11,321
You didn't realize? How could you
not realize? You're stupid.

391
00:19:11,491 --> 00:19:14,289
You are a stupid, stupid man.

392
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,394
I just feel terrible.
This is just terrible.

393
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:18,928
What is the cha-cha?

394
00:19:19,098 --> 00:19:20,429
Yes, indeed.

395
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,498
I'll speak to you later.

396
00:19:26,639 --> 00:19:29,199
This is great. He fired her!

397
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,776
This is incredible. He fired her!
I'm out, baby! I'm out!

398
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:35,846
- Why'd he fire her?
- Because I kissed her in the meeting!

399
00:19:36,015 --> 00:19:38,245
Russell found out. He fired her
over the phone!

400
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:40,909
Finally, my stupidity pays off!

401
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:44,579
What is "Here Come De Judge"?
"Here Come De Judge"!

402
00:19:45,591 --> 00:19:48,685
You can't break up with her.
Her life is shattered. You got her fired.

403
00:19:48,861 --> 00:19:50,328
You gotta be there for her.

404
00:19:50,496 --> 00:19:52,396
You gotta wait until
she gets another job.

405
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:55,227
- Another job?
- A couple of interviews.

406
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:58,131
Oh, this is unbelievable.

407
00:19:58,304 --> 00:20:00,363
I'm stuck.

408
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,371
Every time I think I'm out...

409
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:05,010
...they pull me back in.

410
00:20:12,552 --> 00:20:15,248
Are you going to want to leave
after it's over?

411
00:20:15,421 --> 00:20:17,013
You know, if we have sex.

412
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:20,248
What, leave? Where, why?

413
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,958
You know, the apartment.

414
00:20:23,262 --> 00:20:27,164
- Why would I? This is my apartment.
- Well, what if it was my apartment?

415
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:29,198
Who gave you this idea
I would wanna leave?

416
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:32,897
Well, Elaine said men like to leave
after it's over.

417
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:35,506
I wouldn't put stock in
anything Elaine has to say...

418
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:38,109
...about relationships.
She comes from a broken home.

419
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:41,769
And I mean that literally. A tree fell
on the roof and cracked the structure.

420
00:20:41,948 --> 00:20:45,281
Her parents got along beautifully,
but the house was in bad shape.

421
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,946
Maybe I should be going.

422
00:20:50,823 --> 00:20:52,757
- And what else did you say to her?
- Nothing.

423
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:55,120
I was just giving her
the straight dope.

424
00:20:55,428 --> 00:20:58,591
More like a dope was giving it
to her straight.

425
00:20:58,765 --> 00:21:01,632
Another cup of coffee with you,
she'll wind up in a convent.

426
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:04,832
Listen, there was a lot more
I could've told her, believe me.

427
00:21:05,004 --> 00:21:07,336
What about leaving after sex?
Did I leave with you?

428
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,633
You might have, if I had stayed.

429
00:21:10,977 --> 00:21:13,241
So you know what,
I got served with papers today.

430
00:21:13,412 --> 00:21:15,505
Ping is suing me.

431
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:17,672
I need your virgin as a witness,
so be nice.

432
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:19,181
I was trying to be.

433
00:21:19,752 --> 00:21:21,686
Look at George.
He lucked out, huh?

434
00:21:22,288 --> 00:21:25,416
You're not kidding. Who figured
Susan would break up with him?

435
00:21:25,591 --> 00:21:27,149
- They had a good thing going.
- Yeah.

436
00:21:27,326 --> 00:21:29,260
Since she met him,
she's been vomited on...

437
00:21:29,428 --> 00:21:31,362
...her family cabin's been
burned down...

438
00:21:31,531 --> 00:21:35,365
...learned her father's a homosexual
and got fired from a high-paying job.

439
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:39,603
Yeah, they had
a real good thing going.

440
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,902
What do I do?

441
00:21:42,942 --> 00:21:45,342
Well, actually, I'm a writer.

442
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:50,141
In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot
for NBC right now.

443
00:21:50,883 --> 00:21:52,783
A sitcom?

444
00:21:52,952 --> 00:21:56,388
How can you write that crap?

445
00:21:56,556 --> 00:21:59,787
Carol. This guy's writing a sitcom.

446
00:21:59,959 --> 00:22:01,927
A sitcom?

447
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:08,565
A sitcom.

448
00:22:08,734 --> 00:22:10,258
Can you imagine?

449
00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:13,872
And he actually tried to use it
to hit on me.

450
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,976
In ancient tribal cultures,
they would actually sacrifice a virgin.

451
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:21,739
I mean, they would find some girl
that had never been with anybody...

452
00:22:21,914 --> 00:22:25,680
...and throw her into a volcano.
There's a first date you'll never forget.

453
00:22:26,118 --> 00:22:29,645
She winds up in heaven,
talking with Chuck Woolery, so...

454
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:34,586
"Tell me, Lisa, how did the date end?"
"Not well, Chuck. Not well."

455
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,890
"Well, if you'd like to be thrown into
a volcano again, we'll pay for it."
