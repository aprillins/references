1
00:00:03,874 --> 00:00:05,808
Last week on Seinfeld.

2
00:00:05,976 --> 00:00:07,443
Yeah, I'm here for the audition.

3
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:09,476
The Tonight Show called
and they want me...

4
00:00:09,647 --> 00:00:12,480
...to do the show on the 28th.
They're giving me tickets to L.A.

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,049
- You wanna go?
- A free ticket?

6
00:00:14,218 --> 00:00:15,913
In fact, we could track down Kramer.

7
00:00:16,086 --> 00:00:19,055
I got a very big meeting. I got people
interested in my treatment.

8
00:00:19,223 --> 00:00:20,952
- Pretty young thing.
- She was.

9
00:00:21,125 --> 00:00:23,423
It's a two-day trip.
What are you, Diana Ross?

10
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:26,563
Ladies and gentlemen,
I implore you.

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,755
Don't look. Don't look.
It's Fred Savage.

12
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:32,302
Did I frighten you?
I may look weird, but I'm just like you.

13
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:35,302
I'm just a regular guy, just trying
to make it in this business.

14
00:00:35,472 --> 00:00:37,838
- No witnesses?
- Just the trees, Johnny.

15
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,436
Just the trees.

16
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,408
Could you not tuck the blankets in?

17
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,571
Because I can't sleep all tucked in.

18
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:50,310
I think we just caught a break.

19
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:53,479
All right. So that's one tuck
and one no-tuck.

20
00:00:53,657 --> 00:00:58,924
So that's when I said, "Hey, Kramer,
dude, you ever kill a man before?"

21
00:00:59,096 --> 00:01:00,961
You're on The Tonight Show. NBC.

22
00:01:01,131 --> 00:01:02,655
- Who else is on?
- I don't know.

23
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:03,959
Corbin Bernsen.

24
00:01:04,134 --> 00:01:07,695
Do I have a case for you guys
to do on L.A. Law.

25
00:01:07,871 --> 00:01:09,805
I don't wanna tell you
how to run the show...

26
00:01:09,974 --> 00:01:12,602
- No, of course not.
- It's enough with the bar already.

27
00:01:12,776 --> 00:01:17,213
He's a very handsome man.
Passionate, intense.

28
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:19,042
But troubled, strange.

29
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:22,879
- Let's pick up this Kramer.
- Kramer!

30
00:01:23,053 --> 00:01:25,681
Police have just released
a photo of the suspect...

31
00:01:25,856 --> 00:01:28,086
...being sought in connection
with the slayings.

32
00:01:28,258 --> 00:01:32,058
He is known only as Kramer.

33
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,664
There are many different jobs
in the police.

34
00:01:36,233 --> 00:01:38,565
It seems to me
that "chalk outline guy"...

35
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:41,796
...is one of the better jobs
that you can get.

36
00:01:42,206 --> 00:01:45,664
You know, it's not too dangerous.
The criminals are long gone.

37
00:01:45,843 --> 00:01:47,401
That seems like a good one.

38
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:51,014
I guess they're people that wanted
to be sketch artists...

39
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,581
...but they couldn't draw too well.

40
00:01:53,751 --> 00:01:55,616
"Listen, Johnson,
forget the sketches.

41
00:01:55,786 --> 00:01:58,687
Do you think if we left the body
right there on the sidewalk...

42
00:01:58,856 --> 00:02:01,552
...you could manage to trace
around it?

43
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:04,387
Could you do that?"

44
00:02:05,062 --> 00:02:07,053
How does that even help them
solve the crime?

45
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:09,756
They look at the thing.
"His arm was like that...

46
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:11,400
...when he hit the pavement.

47
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:15,197
That means the killer must
have been Jim."

48
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:23,637
- He's on the loose.
- Let go of my arm. You'll get us killed.

49
00:02:23,814 --> 00:02:26,647
What are we supposed to do?
What do you do in this situation?

50
00:02:26,817 --> 00:02:28,682
Should we call a lawyer
or the police?

51
00:02:28,852 --> 00:02:32,811
Obviously, we're gonna call the police
and tell them he's not the guy.

52
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:37,383
- We hope he's not the guy.
- Couldn't be the guy.

53
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:41,455
God, I'm starved.
I'm weak with hunger.

54
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:44,294
How can you think of food
at a time like this?

55
00:02:44,468 --> 00:02:46,299
A time like what? I'm hungry.

56
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,461
My stomach doesn't know
that Kramer's wanted.

57
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:50,773
I told you, you should
have had breakfast.

58
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:53,876
I couldn't have breakfast.
It was lunchtime.

59
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:56,274
The three-hour time difference
threw me.

60
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:59,280
I wanted a tuna fish sandwich.
They wouldn't serve me one...

61
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,418
...because they were only
serving breakfast.

62
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:05,612
- You should've had some eggs.
- For lunch? Who eats eggs for lunch?

63
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:08,781
Have you ever heard of egg salad?

64
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:10,791
Why didn't you say something?

65
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:12,758
I gotta tell you about egg salad?

66
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,832
I need food, Jerry. I'm feeling faint.
I'm getting lightheaded.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,093
I gotta call the police.
There's a pay phone.

68
00:03:19,536 --> 00:03:21,834
Pay phone in L.A.
Look, it's a miracle.

69
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:32,677
I have no change.
You got any change?

70
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,681
No, I don't. I never carry change.

71
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:37,286
- We need change. All I got is 20s.
- I have a 10.

72
00:03:37,454 --> 00:03:39,285
- So break it.
- I hate asking for change.

73
00:03:39,456 --> 00:03:42,425
They make a face. It's like I'm asking
them to donate a kidney.

74
00:03:42,593 --> 00:03:44,720
- So buy something.
- What?

75
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:47,591
I don't know.
Some mints or Tic Tacs.

76
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:50,256
- Breath problem?
- No. I just want some change.

77
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:52,265
- Tell me.
- Your breath is fine.

78
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:54,165
It's delightful. It's delicious.

79
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:58,240
- You know, I haven't eaten anything.
- I just wanna call the police.

80
00:03:58,408 --> 00:04:01,138
Why don't you just call 911?

81
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:03,844
- But is this an emergency?
- Of course it is.

82
00:04:04,014 --> 00:04:05,345
How is this an emergency?

83
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:08,509
Your friend has been accused
of being a serial killer.

84
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:10,152
I think that qualifies.

85
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:13,818
All right, I'll call 911.

86
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:17,356
Do you think he did it?
Could he have done it?

87
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:19,621
He couldn't have done it.
How could he have?

88
00:04:19,797 --> 00:04:22,493
Couldn't do it. Could he?

89
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,863
Hello, 911? How are you?

90
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:27,765
I'm sorry. Just a reflex.

91
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:31,897
I know it's an emergency number.
It is an emergency.

92
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:34,566
My friend's been accused
of being the Smog Strangler...

93
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:36,645
...and I know he didn't do it.

94
00:04:37,147 --> 00:04:39,741
They're putting me through
to the detective in charge.

95
00:04:39,917 --> 00:04:41,248
Making terrific headway.

96
00:04:41,418 --> 00:04:44,046
What is my name? Who am I?

97
00:04:44,221 --> 00:04:47,213
I'm George Costanza.

98
00:04:47,457 --> 00:04:48,981
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?

99
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:51,354
- What are you using my name for?
- Don't be a baby.

100
00:04:51,528 --> 00:04:54,463
- What are you scared of?
- I'm scared of the same thing you are:

101
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:56,997
Everything. Why don't you just
use your own name?

102
00:04:57,167 --> 00:05:00,364
Your name is a good name. Costanza.
Sounds like it stands for something.

103
00:05:00,537 --> 00:05:02,266
- They'll believe us.
- Really?

104
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,838
- Sure.
- You think so?

105
00:05:04,007 --> 00:05:05,304
Oh, yeah.

106
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:09,172
Yes, I have very important information
regarding the Smog Strangler.

107
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,773
Get yourself a mint or something.

108
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:13,576
Can I come in right now?

109
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,342
I suppose.

110
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,352
Where are you located?
Where is that?

111
00:05:18,822 --> 00:05:21,188
I don't know where we are.
Where are we?

112
00:05:21,358 --> 00:05:23,053
- I don't know
- We don't know.

113
00:05:23,227 --> 00:05:25,286
He says, "Ask somebody."
Ask that guy.

114
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:27,396
- Excuse me, where are we?
- Earth.

115
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:31,225
Hey, you know, I'm on the phone
with the police.

116
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,235
Some guy just gave me
a wise answer.

117
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:38,636
Ask that woman.

118
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:40,936
- Excuse me, what street are we on?
- I don't know.

119
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:42,669
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

120
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:45,542
How could you not know
what street you're on?

121
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:47,980
You don't know.

122
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:53,714
George, it says here on the phone.
It's 12145 Ventura Boulevard.

123
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:55,422
Okay.

124
00:05:55,592 --> 00:05:57,890
Do we know where the 101 is?
No.

125
00:05:58,061 --> 00:06:00,495
Do we know where the 170 is?
No.

126
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:02,791
Do we know where the 134 is?

127
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:04,732
No.

128
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:07,927
Okay.

129
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:11,839
He's gonna send a black and white
to pick us up.

130
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:14,068
- Black and white?
- Cop car.

131
00:06:14,244 --> 00:06:17,111
- Why didn't you just say that?
- I thought it sounded cool.

132
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:19,977
- Yeah, real cool. You're a cool guy.
- Oh, you are.

133
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,448
I guarantee you Lupe's gonna tuck
your covers in.

134
00:06:22,619 --> 00:06:24,519
- I'll bet you. How much?
- Her tip.

135
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:26,815
- You got a bet.
- Okay.

136
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,220
How much do you tip
a chambermaid?

137
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:31,759
Which one of you is Costanza?

138
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:33,926
Get in.

139
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:38,757
Hi. How are you?
Guys, listen...

140
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:43,032
...do either one of you have a mint,
or a piece of gum, or something?

141
00:06:54,785 --> 00:06:57,754
Hey, Jerry, do me a favor.
Close your window.

142
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:02,486
Hey, get out of here.

143
00:07:03,961 --> 00:07:07,863
- Hey, he's fooling around back here.
- Cut it out back there.

144
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,862
- He started it.
- I did not.

145
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,933
You guys gonna go through
some red lights?

146
00:07:12,102 --> 00:07:13,865
I don't think so.

147
00:07:14,037 --> 00:07:17,063
- But you could.
- Oh, yeah. Of course we could.

148
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,707
We could do anything we want.

149
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,776
We can drive on the wrong side
of the road.

150
00:07:21,945 --> 00:07:25,346
We do that all the time. You should
see the looks on the people's faces.

151
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:27,014
Shoot people.

152
00:07:27,184 --> 00:07:29,516
You guys ever shot anybody?

153
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:32,917
- No.
- No.

154
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,422
- Can I flip on the siren?
- Why are you bothering them?

155
00:07:35,592 --> 00:07:38,390
I'm just asking.
All they have to do is say no.

156
00:07:39,863 --> 00:07:41,831
Yeah, go ahead.

157
00:07:43,967 --> 00:07:46,629
- Check it out.
- Can I try it?

158
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:49,465
Yeah, go ahead. Hurry up.

159
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,170
Scared the hell out of that guy.

160
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,171
You know what I've never understood?
Why did they change the siren noise?

161
00:07:57,347 --> 00:07:59,542
When I was a kid, it was always:

162
00:08:01,051 --> 00:08:02,518
You know, and now it's:

163
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:05,745
Why'd they do that?
Did they do some research?

164
00:08:05,922 --> 00:08:08,356
Did they find out "woo-woo"
is more effective than "waa"?

165
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:11,119
Yeah, hey, what about those
English sirens, you know?

166
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:15,426
Hey!

167
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,353
I'm dizzy.

168
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,984
- Nice shotgun.
- Thanks.

169
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,361
- Clean as a whistle.
- You could eat off that shotgun.

170
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:49,328
- What is that, a 12-gauge?
- Yeah.

171
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:52,361
Twelve-gauge. Seems to be
the most popular gauge.

172
00:08:52,536 --> 00:08:55,232
- Big gauge. My favorite.
- Mine too. Love the 12-gauge.

173
00:08:55,405 --> 00:08:57,669
Makes the 11 -gauge look
like a cap pistol.

174
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,809
- What do we got over there?
- What?

175
00:08:59,976 --> 00:09:02,968
- I don't know.
- Looks like a possible 519.

176
00:09:03,146 --> 00:09:05,376
- 519? What's a 519?
- Where?

177
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,143
- You think so?
- Looks like it.

178
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:12,084
- I can't believe this. A 519?
- Where? Where? I can't see.

179
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:16,521
This is car 23. We have a possible
519 in progress. Over.

180
00:09:16,693 --> 00:09:19,025
All right. Let's pull over
and check it out.

181
00:09:19,196 --> 00:09:20,788
Pull over?

182
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:22,293
You can't pull over.

183
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:24,525
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

184
00:09:24,701 --> 00:09:27,932
Pull over? The lieutenant
is waiting to see us.

185
00:09:28,105 --> 00:09:30,869
- Hey, hey, hey. We're in a rush here!
- We have an appointment.

186
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,305
What are you doing?

187
00:09:41,184 --> 00:09:42,742
Great.

188
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:47,218
There's a bag of Pepperidge Farm
cookies up there.

189
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,018
- What kind?
- Milano.

190
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:54,027
Cops eating Milanos?
What kind of crazy town is this?

191
00:09:54,197 --> 00:09:57,633
- Should I take some?
- I think that's a 519.

192
00:09:57,934 --> 00:09:59,458
I'm starving.

193
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,531
- Spread them.
- Hey, they're busting this guy.

194
00:10:02,706 --> 00:10:04,469
They're cuffing him.

195
00:10:07,644 --> 00:10:10,238
I can't believe this.

196
00:10:17,154 --> 00:10:20,749
I can't believe that cops
still have to read...

197
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:23,916
...that whole "you have the right
to remain silent" speech...

198
00:10:24,094 --> 00:10:25,561
...to every criminal they arrest.

199
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:28,562
Is there anybody that doesn't
know that by now?

200
00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:31,565
Can't they go, "You're under arrest.
You ever seen a Baretta?"

201
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:34,203
"Yeah." "Good. Get in the car."

202
00:10:37,874 --> 00:10:39,364
Hi.

203
00:10:39,543 --> 00:10:40,805
Hi, I'm Jerry.

204
00:10:40,977 --> 00:10:43,343
George. How you doing?

205
00:10:43,947 --> 00:10:45,380
What'd you do?

206
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:47,107
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

207
00:10:47,284 --> 00:10:50,617
Oh, yeah, right. Me neither.
Hey, I didn't do nothing.

208
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:52,888
Shut up.

209
00:10:54,124 --> 00:10:57,560
- Hot out.
- Brutal.

210
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:04,862
What do you tip a chambermaid?

211
00:11:05,902 --> 00:11:08,132
I don't know. Five bucks a night.

212
00:11:08,405 --> 00:11:12,273
No. A dollar. Two, tops.

213
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:15,703
Hey, you guys aren't cuffed.
What are you, narcs?

214
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:19,007
- Narcs.
- Imagine. Us, narcs.

215
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:22,811
No, no. No, actually, we're friends
of a serial killer.

216
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:24,920
- Just trying to help him out.
- Really?

217
00:11:25,088 --> 00:11:26,555
- Yeah.
- That's very nice.

218
00:11:26,723 --> 00:11:29,317
- Thank you.
- Suspected serial killer.

219
00:11:29,492 --> 00:11:32,290
- He didn't actually do it.
- Yeah, well, we don't think.

220
00:11:32,462 --> 00:11:33,929
We're pretty sure.

221
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:38,762
- A dollar a night?
- Yeah. That's a good tip.

222
00:11:38,935 --> 00:11:41,631
- That stinks.
- I read it in Ann Landers.

223
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:46,742
- Ann Landers sucks!
- Hey, shut up back there.

224
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,311
Attention, all units. Attention, all units.
All units, code three.

225
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,471
All units in the area,
code three in progress.

226
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:57,746
1648 North Las Palmas. Units require
assistance in apprehension, 702.

227
00:11:57,921 --> 00:11:59,946
- That's the Smog Strangler.
- Kramer.

228
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:01,488
- They got him.
- Let's go.

229
00:12:17,674 --> 00:12:19,642
We've gotta go.
Let's see what's happening.

230
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:23,006
I don't know why I'm doing this.
Oh, man.

231
00:12:27,717 --> 00:12:29,776
Jerry. George.

232
00:12:29,953 --> 00:12:34,390
You're under arrest for first-degree
murder in the death of Chelsea Lange.

233
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:51,736
Why'd you do it? Why'd you do it?
People wanna know, please!

234
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:54,274
- What possessed you?
- Well, I don't know.

235
00:12:54,444 --> 00:12:57,675
- Do you have any regrets?
- How are you?

236
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:07,513
Hey!

237
00:13:08,158 --> 00:13:09,921
Hey!

238
00:13:11,594 --> 00:13:16,861
- Hey, how you doing? Jerry! George!
- We're doing fine. How are you?

239
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:20,093
What? Me? Fabulous.
Just fabulous.

240
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,068
I got a lot of auditions,
a lot of callbacks.

241
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:25,366
I got a lot of interest
in my movie treatment.

242
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:28,568
You know, I'm in development.
I'm developing vehicles.

243
00:13:28,745 --> 00:13:32,647
Man, there's a lot of energy here, man.
You know, the vibe, it's powerful.

244
00:13:32,816 --> 00:13:36,047
I'm just swept up in it.
Yeah, I'm a player.

245
00:13:36,219 --> 00:13:39,086
- You're a player?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm a player.

246
00:13:39,322 --> 00:13:42,120
Kramer, do you realize
what's going on here?

247
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:44,226
Do you know why you're here?

248
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:49,396
What, this? I'll be out of here
in a couple of hours.

249
00:13:49,632 --> 00:13:52,430
Hey, guess who I met today.
Fred Savage.

250
00:13:52,602 --> 00:13:55,036
Oh, nice kid. A really good kid.

251
00:13:55,205 --> 00:13:57,730
You know, we're talking about
doing a project together.

252
00:13:57,907 --> 00:14:01,365
Kramer, you've been arrested
as a serial killer.

253
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:05,642
So? I'm innocent.

254
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:09,046
I mean, you guys believe that
I'm innocent, don't you?

255
00:14:09,219 --> 00:14:12,052
Jerry? George?

256
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:14,713
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah, sure.

257
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:16,882
Kramer, let's go.
Lieutenant wants to see you.

258
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,461
Yeah, okay, yeah. All right.
Look, I'll be out of here by noon.

259
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,326
Hey, maybe we'll have lunch
together, huh?

260
00:14:27,303 --> 00:14:29,897
Hey, is it all right if I talk
to them again?

261
00:14:30,073 --> 00:14:32,007
Yeah, okay.

262
00:14:32,675 --> 00:14:39,080
Help me! Oh, God, help me! Get me
out of here! George, Jerry, get me out!

263
00:14:40,517 --> 00:14:41,779
Get me...!

264
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:44,886
I didn't kill anyone. I swear.
I swear to God!

265
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:47,579
Don't you ever swear
to my God, Kramer.

266
00:14:47,857 --> 00:14:51,452
My God protects the innocent
and punishes evil scum like you.

267
00:14:51,628 --> 00:14:53,823
- Have you got that?
- You're making a big mistake.

268
00:14:53,997 --> 00:14:56,989
No! You made a mistake, Kramer.

269
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:59,226
Sickies like you always do.

270
00:14:59,402 --> 00:15:02,530
The only difference is this time
you're gonna pay.

271
00:15:02,705 --> 00:15:04,639
Now, you might beat
the gas chamber, Kramer.

272
00:15:04,808 --> 00:15:06,571
But as long as I've got a breath...

273
00:15:06,743 --> 00:15:08,802
...you will never see the light
of day again.

274
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:12,175
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You got
the wrong man! It wasn't me!

275
00:15:12,348 --> 00:15:15,044
Yeah, right. Maybe it was one
of your other personalities.

276
00:15:15,218 --> 00:15:18,984
What? The wise guy, the little kid,
the bellhop, the ballplayer?

277
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:21,885
Maybe the door-to-door vacuum
cleaner salesman, but not you.

278
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:23,992
No, you wouldn't hurt a fly.

279
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,492
You just couldn't help yourself,
could you, Kramer?

280
00:15:26,663 --> 00:15:29,996
You saw a life, brimming brightly
with optimism and verve...

281
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:33,067
...and you just had to snuff it out.
- Can I talk to somebody?

282
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:36,228
- You're not letting me explain!
- I don't want your explanations.

283
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:39,336
Sure, I bet you've got
a million of them.

284
00:15:39,943 --> 00:15:41,638
Maybe your mom didn't love
you enough.

285
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:45,303
Maybe the teacher didn't call on you
when you had your hand raised.

286
00:15:45,482 --> 00:15:48,849
Maybe the pervert in the park
had a present in his pants, huh?

287
00:15:49,018 --> 00:15:50,713
Oh, I got another theory for you.

288
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:52,218
- You're a weed.
- No.

289
00:15:52,388 --> 00:15:53,912
- Society's filled with them.
- No.

290
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,082
You're choking the life out
of all the pretty flowers.

291
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,921
You see something young and pretty...

292
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:01,529
...you just got to choke
the life out of it, don't you?

293
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:04,360
You killed the pretty flowers,
didn't you, Kramer?

294
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:06,866
You killed the pretty little flowers,
didn't you?

295
00:16:07,036 --> 00:16:10,904
You dirty, filthy, stinking weed!
Didn't you?

296
00:16:11,074 --> 00:16:12,439
I...

297
00:16:14,577 --> 00:16:17,808
Lieutenant, for you.

298
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:21,144
Martel. Yeah.

299
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:22,909
Yeah.

300
00:16:23,553 --> 00:16:25,020
Yeah.

301
00:16:25,555 --> 00:16:27,284
Yeah.

302
00:16:27,457 --> 00:16:30,392
- What is it, lieutenant?
- Let him go.

303
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,051
- What? But, lieutenant...
- You heard me. Let him go.

304
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:34,457
Get him out of here.

305
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:37,566
They just found another body
up in Laurel Canyon.

306
00:16:37,734 --> 00:16:39,827
Go on, Kramer. Get out of my sight.

307
00:16:40,003 --> 00:16:41,834
How'd you know about
the guy in the park?

308
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:43,529
I said, beat it.

309
00:16:51,781 --> 00:16:53,476
- What happened?
- Somebody got killed...

310
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,641
...while they had me in custody.
- Really?

311
00:16:55,818 --> 00:16:57,410
Hear that?
Somebody else was killed.

312
00:16:57,587 --> 00:16:59,578
No kidding!
Somebody else got killed?

313
00:16:59,756 --> 00:17:02,224
While he was in jail.
So you're free!

314
00:17:02,392 --> 00:17:07,420
Yes, I'm free because the murderer
struck again. Hey!

315
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:13,761
So, Kramer, what are you gonna do?

316
00:17:13,937 --> 00:17:16,565
Do? Do?

317
00:17:16,739 --> 00:17:19,071
Hey, I'm doing what I do.

318
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:21,670
You know, I've always done what I do.

319
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:23,675
I'm doing what I do.

320
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:27,680
The way I've always done it,
and the way I'll always do it.

321
00:17:27,984 --> 00:17:29,918
Kramer, what the hell
are you talking about?

322
00:17:30,186 --> 00:17:31,619
Well, what do you
want me to say?

323
00:17:31,788 --> 00:17:34,086
That things haven't worked out
the way I've planned?

324
00:17:34,257 --> 00:17:37,488
That I'm struggling, barely able
to keep my head above water?

325
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,254
That L.A.'s a cold place
even in the middle of summer.

326
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:44,389
That it's a lonely place even when
you're stuck in traffic on the freeway?

327
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:47,434
That I'm no better than
the screenwriter driving a cab...

328
00:17:47,604 --> 00:17:50,971
...the starlet turning tricks, the
producer in a house he can't afford?

329
00:17:51,207 --> 00:17:53,767
Is that what you want me to say?

330
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:55,810
- I'd like to hear that.
- Yeah.

331
00:17:55,979 --> 00:17:58,413
Well, I'm not saying that.

332
00:17:58,581 --> 00:18:01,345
You know, things are going
pretty well for me here.

333
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:04,486
- I met a girl.
- Kramer, she was murdered.

334
00:18:04,654 --> 00:18:08,784
Yeah, well, you know, I wasn't looking
for a long-term relationship.

335
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:12,018
- I was on TV.
- As a suspect in a serial killing.

336
00:18:12,195 --> 00:18:15,995
Okay, yeah, all right. You guys gotta
put a negative spin on everything.

337
00:18:16,165 --> 00:18:19,566
What do they put in this tuna?
Tastes like a dill. I think it's a dill.

338
00:18:19,736 --> 00:18:23,536
- So you're not coming back with us?
- No, I'm not ready, you know.

339
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:26,106
I mean, things are starting
to happen for me.

340
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:28,539
Taste this. Is this a dill?

341
00:18:31,314 --> 00:18:32,975
No, it's a tarragon.

342
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:36,175
Listen, Kramer, I'm sorry
about that whole fight we had...

343
00:18:36,352 --> 00:18:39,219
...about you having my apartment keys
and everything.

344
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,681
All right.

345
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:44,349
Okay, it's forgotten.

346
00:18:44,527 --> 00:18:46,222
- Tarragon?
- Yeah.

347
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:48,496
Oh, you're crazy.

348
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:50,462
- Take it easy, buddy.
- Yeah, okay.

349
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:52,931
Yep, take care. Stay in touch.

350
00:18:53,102 --> 00:18:56,594
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Come on, give me a hug, you guys.

351
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:59,936
Kramer, my sandwich.
You're crushing my sandwich.

352
00:19:31,641 --> 00:19:36,044
You know, it's so nice
when it happens good.

353
00:19:52,595 --> 00:19:55,587
- Mint?
- No, thanks.

354
00:19:56,365 --> 00:19:58,959
I gotta tell you.
I'm really disappointed in Lupe.

355
00:19:59,302 --> 00:20:02,066
It's been three days already.
Forget about Lupe.

356
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:05,668
Think she gets to take any of those
little bars of soap home?

357
00:20:05,842 --> 00:20:07,139
No, I don't.

358
00:20:08,377 --> 00:20:11,778
You'd think when they hand out the
checks, they'd throw in a few soaps.

359
00:20:11,948 --> 00:20:15,042
Yeah, maybe they should throw
in a couple of lamps too.

360
00:20:15,218 --> 00:20:19,018
I'll tell you, if I owned a company,
my employees would love me.

361
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:22,055
They'd have huge pictures of me
on the walls and in their home.

362
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:24,125
Like Lenin.

363
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:26,921
How much did you wind up
tipping her?

364
00:20:27,096 --> 00:20:30,293
Oh, my God, I forgot.

365
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:32,627
That's why communism didn't work.

366
00:20:34,337 --> 00:20:36,032
Hey!

367
00:20:43,246 --> 00:20:46,272
- Got any mustard? This is empty.
- Yeah, there's a new one in there.

368
00:20:46,449 --> 00:20:48,883
No, no. I don't like this one.
It's too yellow.

369
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,077
- Did you know he was back?
- No.

370
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:53,722
- Got any pickles?
- Help yourself.

371
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,552
Yeah. All right.

372
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:59,895
Kramer, what are you doing here?

373
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:02,260
I'm getting something to eat.

374
00:21:02,431 --> 00:21:03,921
Kramer.

375
00:21:05,034 --> 00:21:06,524
Here.

376
00:21:18,514 --> 00:21:21,677
Authorities disclosed today that
the latest Smog Stranglings suspect...

377
00:21:23,186 --> 00:21:25,586
...was apprehended this week
on an unrelated charge...

378
00:21:25,755 --> 00:21:27,518
...but somehow managed to escape...

379
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,625
...from the police car
in which he was being held.

380
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:34,229
Tobias Lehigh Nagy,
who is also wanted...

381
00:21:34,397 --> 00:21:37,457
...in connection with unrelated
slayings in the Northwest...

382
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:40,966
...is still at large,
his whereabouts unknown.

383
00:21:41,137 --> 00:21:44,334
He is described as 5'5", bald...

384
00:21:44,507 --> 00:21:48,204
...and reputedly
a very generous tipper.

385
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:51,346
The thing about L.A. to me
that kind of threw me...

386
00:21:51,514 --> 00:21:54,210
...was when, you know, they have
the smog alerts out there.

387
00:21:54,383 --> 00:21:58,877
And they actually recommend
that people stay indoors...

388
00:21:59,055 --> 00:22:04,049
...during the smog alert.
Now, maybe I'm way off...

389
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:05,883
...but don't you think...?

390
00:22:06,062 --> 00:22:08,860
Wouldn't you assume that the air
in the house...

391
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:14,094
...pretty much comes from the air
in the city where the house is?

392
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:16,766
What do they think?
We live in a jar...

393
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:19,134
...with a couple of holes
punched in the top?

394
00:22:19,308 --> 00:22:21,708
What the hell's going on out there?
It's very strange.

395
00:22:21,878 --> 00:22:25,211
Do you realize it is now possible
for parents to say to their children:

396
00:22:25,381 --> 00:22:29,147
"All right, kids, I want you in the house
and get some fresh air.

397
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:32,810
Summer vacation.
Everybody indoors."
