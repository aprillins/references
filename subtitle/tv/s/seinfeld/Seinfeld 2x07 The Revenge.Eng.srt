1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,112
Whenever I see the news
and they're...

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:08,910
...hauling in some criminal, terrorist,
psycho, maniac, mass-murderer guy...

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,237
You notice he's always
covering up his face?

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,549
What is he worried about?

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,631
I mean,
what is this man's reputation...

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,917
...that he has to worry
about this kind of exposure...

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,548
...damaging his good name?

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,598
I mean, what is he,
up for a big job promotion...

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,273
...down at the office or something?

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,590
Afraid the boss is gonna
catch this on TV and go:

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,116
" Isn't that Johnson from sales?

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,636
He's up in that clock tower,
picking people off one by one.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,392
I don't know
if that's the kind of man...

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,710
...we want heading up
that new branch office.

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,193
He should be in bill collection.
I think he's got aptitude."

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,955
She was great.

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,912
You don't want to know.

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,959
Hey, Brecky, remind me to tell you
what we did in Lake George.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,430
Get this, I got it all on video.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,436
That's it. This is it.

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,511
I'm done! Through! It's over!

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,432
I'm gone! Finished! Over!

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,160
I will never work for you again!
Look at you.

24
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,276
You think you're an important man?

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,199
You are a laughingstock.
You are a joke.

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,157
These people are laughing at you!

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,871
You're nothing! You have no brains,
no ability, nothing!

28
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,712
I quit!

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,869
- Hey.
- Hey.

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,759
Boy, I have really
had it with Newman.

31
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,992
He wakes me up again, last night,
at 3:00 in the morning...

32
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,390
...to tell me he's going on the roof
to kill himself.

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,869
- Well, what did you say?
- I said, "Jump."

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,590
He's been threatening
to do this for years.

35
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,673
I said, " If you're gonna kill yourself,
do it already and stop bothering me."

36
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,311
At least I'd respect the guy
for accomplishing something.

37
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,754
What's his problem?

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,433
No job, no women.

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,155
He called the right guy.

40
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,399
What am I supposed to tell him?

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,471
How much there is
for him to live for?

42
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,958
Why should I lie to him?

43
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,438
I'm leaving. I'm going to the laundry.

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,989
Why don't you use the machines
down in the basement?

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,550
Fluff and fold, the only way to live.

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,679
I drop it off, I pick it up.
It's a delight.

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,750
- How about if I put a...?
- I don't want to do that.

48
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,198
- What, you're going over there, what?
- I don't want to mix in everything.

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,670
My guys don't know your guys.

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,271
You can't just lock them all
in the same machine together.

51
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,714
They'll start a riot.

52
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,393
Have you ever met my guys?

53
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,236
- No, I can't say as I have.
- Well...

54
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,470
All right, put them on top.

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,431
Oh, beautiful.

56
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,513
This stuff on top is my friend's.

57
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,716
Could I get it done
in a separate machine?

58
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,711
I'll have to charge you
for another machine.

59
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,393
Whatever it costs. In fact...

60
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,109
...I would prefer it if the machines
are not even touching each other...

61
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,953
...because something could,
you know, jump across.

62
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,433
Guess what.

63
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,314
- How did you know I was here?
- Kramer. Guess what.

64
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,710
- I don't know.
- I quit my job.

65
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,235
- Get out of here.
- I couldn't take it anymore.

66
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,879
You can have this on Monday.

67
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,189
What happened? Levitan?

68
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,238
I go in to use his private bathroom.
Everybody uses it.

69
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,152
And then I get a memo...
A memo...

70
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,198
...telling me to use
the men's room in the hall.

71
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,397
I mean, we share it with
Pace Electronics. It's disgusting!

72
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,148
You and your toilets.

73
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,357
I snapped. It was the last straw.

74
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,878
What are you gonna do?
Look for something else in real estate?

75
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,110
Nobody's hiring now.
The market's terrible.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,195
So, what are you gonna do?

77
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,236
I like sports. I could do
something in sports.

78
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,428
In what capacity?

79
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,032
You know, like the general manager
of a baseball team.

80
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,070
Yeah, well, that...
That can be tough to get.

81
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,192
Well, it doesn't even have to be
the general manager.

82
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,119
Maybe I could be, like, an announcer,
like, a colour man.

83
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,554
You know how I always make...

84
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,517
...interesting comments
during the game?

85
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,236
Yeah. Yeah,
you make good comments.

86
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,072
So, what about that?

87
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,755
Well, they tend to give
those jobs to ex-ballplayers...

88
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,993
...and people that are,
you know, in broadcasting.

89
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,073
- Well, that's really not fair.
- I know.

90
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,075
Well, okay, okay.
What else do you like?

91
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,073
Movies. I like to watch movies.

92
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,959
Yeah, yeah.

93
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,670
Do they pay people
to watch movies?

94
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,117
Projectionists.

95
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,998
- That's true.
- But you got to know...

96
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,071
...how to work the projector.

97
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,278
Right.

98
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,192
And it's probably a union thing.

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,752
Those unions.

100
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,674
Okay, sports...

101
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,671
...movies...

102
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,190
What about a talk show host?

103
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,550
Talk show host, that's good.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,479
I think I'd be good at that.

105
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,676
I talk to people all the time.

106
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,796
Someone said once I'd be
a good talk show host.

107
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,315
- Really?
- Yeah, a couple of people.

108
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,552
How do you get that?
Where do you start?

109
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,280
Well, that's where it gets tricky.

110
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,437
You can't walk into a building and say,
" I want to be a talk show host."

111
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,113
I wouldn't think so.

112
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,358
It's all politics.

113
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,636
All right, okay, sports, movies,
talk show host...

114
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,558
What else?

115
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,830
This could have been
a huge mistake.

116
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,157
Yeah, well, it doesn't sound like
you completely thought this through.

117
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,473
I guess not.

118
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,992
- What should I do?
- Maybe you can just go back.

119
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,268
- Go back?
- Yeah.

120
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,073
Pretend like it never happened.

121
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,233
You mean just walk in on Monday
morning like it never happened?

122
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,675
Sure. You're an emotional person.

123
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,638
People don't take you seriously.

124
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,035
Just go back.

125
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,675
- Pretend it never happened.
- Never happened.

126
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,797
I was blowing off a little steam.
So what?

127
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,191
- So what? You're entitled.
- I'm emotional.

128
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,271
That's right, you're emotional.

129
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,713
- Never happened.
- Never happened.

130
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,318
To me, the most annoying thing...

131
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,438
...about the couple of times
I did work in an office...

132
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,398
...is when you go in in the morning,
you say " hi" to everyone...

133
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,437
...and then, throughout the day...

134
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,558
...you have to continue
to greet these people...

135
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,075
...all day, every time you see them.

136
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,959
" Morning, Bill." " Morning, Bob."
" How you doing?" " Fine."

137
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,839
Ten minutes later, you see them
in the hall, " How you doing?"

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,753
Every time you pass, you've gotta
come up with another greeting.

139
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,478
You start racking your brains.

140
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,996
You do the little eyebrow,
you know, " Hey."

141
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,997
You start coming up
with nicknames for them.

142
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,957
"Jimbo."

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,592
How you doing?

144
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,350
What are you doing here?

145
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,272
What? I work here.

146
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,476
I thought you quit.

147
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,837
What quit? Who quit?

148
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,513
Bill, how was your weekend?

149
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,069
Excellent weekend.
What about your weekend?

150
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,549
- Fine weekend.
- Yeah, good weekend.

151
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,518
Went up to the Cape.
Took the kids sailing.

152
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,238
Lisa was a little scared at first...

153
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,470
...but that kid's gonna be
a good sailor someday.

154
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,437
She's gonna be a fine sailor.

155
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,315
Ava, what happened to you
Friday afternoon?

156
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,995
- I got tied up.
- I'll bet you did.

157
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,160
I want to remind everyone
that the 1 0th anniversary party...

158
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,835
...for Rick Barr Properties is gonna be
Wednesday afternoon at 4:00...

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,956
...in Lasky's Bar on Madison and 48th.

160
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,557
I want all of you to be there.
This really means a lot to me.

161
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,551
Is that Costanza over there?

162
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,317
What are you doing here?

163
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,555
- What?
- Am I crazy or didn't you quit?

164
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,196
- When?
- Friday.

165
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,998
Oh, what? That?

166
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,594
Are you kidding? I didn't quit.

167
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,990
Why, you took that seriously?

168
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,116
You mean " laughingstock,"
all that stuff.

169
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,633
Come on. Will you stop it?

170
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,872
- " No brains, no ability"?
- Teasing.

171
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,191
Okay, I want you out of here.

172
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,033
I don't know where
you're getting this from.

173
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,596
You're serious, aren't you?
Oh, you see...

174
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,478
...you just don't know
my sense of humour.

175
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,394
I mean, Dan, don't I joke around
all the time?

176
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,471
I wouldn't say all the time.

177
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,438
You can't win.
You can't beat me.

178
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,468
That's why I'm here,
and you're there.

179
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,753
Because I'm a winner.

180
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,960
I'll always be a winner...

181
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,476
...and you'll always be a loser.

182
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,469
" I'll always be a winner,
and you'll always be a loser."

183
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,312
This is what he said to me.

184
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,630
- Well, so that's that.
- No, that's not that.

185
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,031
- That's not that?
- No.

186
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,191
Well, if that's not that, what is that?

187
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,079
I got some plans. I got plans.

188
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,231
- What kind of plans?
- What's the difference?

189
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,072
You don't wanna tell me?

190
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,750
I'm gonna slip him a Mickey.

191
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,075
What, in his drink?
Are you out of your mind?

192
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,231
What are you, Peter Lorre?

193
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,109
You don't understand.
He's got this big party coming up.

194
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,556
He's been looking forward to this.
This is gonna destroy the whole thing.

195
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,274
- What if you destroy him?
- No, no, no. Don't worry.

196
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,237
It's perfectly safe. I researched it.

197
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,516
He'll get a little woozy.

198
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,831
He might keel over.

199
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,399
- Well, what does that do? Big deal.
- This is what they'd do in the movies.

200
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,949
It's the beautiful thing.
It's like a movie.

201
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,793
I'm gonna slip him a Mickey.

202
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,755
You've really gone mental.

203
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,149
Where are you gonna get this Mickey?
I can't believe I'm saying " Mickey."

204
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,150
I got a source.

205
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,437
You got a Mickey source?

206
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,040
And Elaine is gonna
keep him busy.

207
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,238
Elaine? How did you rope
her into this?

208
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,914
I told her what a sexist he is.
How he cheats on his wife.

209
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,878
- She knew that.
- She didn't know he doesn't recycle.

210
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,270
What is the point of all this?

211
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,637
- Revenge.
- The best revenge is living well.

212
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,429
There's no chance of that.

213
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,833
- Did you get your laundry?
- Yeah.

214
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,158
What's with you?

215
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,198
He jumped.

216
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,912
- What?
- Newman jumped.

217
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,559
- Did he call you last night?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

218
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,031
What did you say?

219
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,993
I said, "Wave to me
when you pass my window."

220
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,112
Did he wave?

221
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,551
No. He jumped
from the second floor.

222
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,518
Mr. Papanicolas saw him
from across the street.

223
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,716
He's lying out there faking.

224
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,472
See, he's trying to get back at me.

225
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,596
- Oh, my God.
- What? What's the matter?

226
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,593
On Thursday when I came home,
I had 1 500 dollars on me.

227
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,194
For some reason, I decided to hide it
in my laundry bag...

228
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,158
...and then I completely
forgot about it.

229
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,630
And then I took the laundry
in on Friday!

230
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,313
- Oh, come on, let's go.
- Where? Where?

231
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,277
To the Laundromat.

232
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,949
I never saw it.

233
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,032
Okay, come on, give the guy
his money. What are you doing?

234
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,918
Hey, you see that sign up there?

235
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,314
I see. You put up a sign
so you can do whatever you want.

236
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,993
You're not a part of society.

237
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,309
Yeah, that's right.

238
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,516
Because this place is my country...

239
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,468
...and I'm the president,
and that's my Constitution.

240
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,757
I'm not responsible.

241
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,593
So anybody leaves anything here,
you could just take it.

242
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,988
You have a license to steal.

243
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,311
You are like
the James Bond of laundry.

244
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,235
- You ever hear of a bank?
- Come on, let's go.

245
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,675
No, you can't let him
get away with this.

246
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,956
- Which one is he?
- That's him over there.

247
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,315
The one that looks like a blowfish.

248
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,273
- Oh, yeah. I see him.
- Yeah.

249
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,319
Hey, thanks for doing this.

250
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,517
Why pass up the opportunity
to go to prison?

251
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,230
This is the most exciting thing
I've ever done.

252
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,436
Yeah, it is kind of cool.

253
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,909
First time in my life I've ever
gotten back at someone.

254
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,470
I can't believe we're doing this. It's
the kind of thing they do in the movies.

255
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,039
That's exactly what I told Jerry.

256
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,872
- Really?
- Yes.

257
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,838
God, I've never felt so alive.

258
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,473
Maybe we should call this off.

259
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,472
Come on, what's the big deal?

260
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,030
We're just gonna put a little concrete
in the washing machine.

261
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,998
- And what's gonna happen?
- Well, it'll mix up with the water...

262
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,436
...and then, by the end of the cycle,
it'll be a solid block.

263
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,035
If only you could put your mind
to something worthwhile.

264
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,194
You're like Lex Luthor.

265
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,591
You keep him busy.

266
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,392
You go over there,
you start flirting with him...

267
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,438
...and I'll come by,
and while you're keeping him busy...

268
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,556
...l'll slip it in his drink.

269
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,029
Wouldn't it be easier
just to punch him in the mouth?

270
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,115
Come on. They're terrible.

271
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,998
They got no infield.

272
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,997
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

273
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,957
I'm gonna get some food.
You want some?

274
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,439
No.

275
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,519
Hi.

276
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,113
Hi.

277
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,952
God bless you.

278
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,757
Thank you. Thank you very much.

279
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,313
Really, I mean that.
I am not one of those people...

280
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,074
...who gives insincere thank-yous.
No, sir. No, sir.

281
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,754
When I thank somebody,
I really thank them.

282
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,276
So thank you.

283
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,273
- You're welcome.
- People don't say "God bless you"...

284
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,034
...as much as they used to.
Have you noticed that?

285
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,239
No.

286
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,837
So I'm going
to a nudist colony next week.

287
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,789
Nudist colony? Really?

288
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,191
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I love nudist colonies.

289
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,033
They help me unwind.

290
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,518
I've never been to a nudist colony.

291
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,797
Oh, really? Oh, you should go.
They're great. They're great.

292
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,272
Of course, when it's over, it's hard to
get used to all this clothing, you know.

293
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,874
So a lot of times I'll just lock the door
to my office...

294
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,712
...and I'll just sit there naked.

295
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,388
- Seriously?
- Oh, yeah.

296
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,516
I usually work naked
a couple hours a day.

297
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,758
Glenda, can I ask you a favour?

298
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,148
Could I have this seat?

299
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,395
What do you have to sit here for?
There are plenty of other seats.

300
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,996
I can't explain.
It's very important that I sit here.

301
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,594
What are you doing here anyway?
I thought you were fired.

302
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,320
Okay, okay. Fine.

303
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,916
I cook naked, I clean...

304
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,553
I clean naked. I drive naked.

305
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,075
Naked, naked, naked.

306
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,388
Who are you?

307
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,988
Oh, you don't want to know, mister.
I'm trouble.

308
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,991
Big trouble.

309
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,594
What about the gentle cycle?
You ever use that?

310
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,150
Do you think it's effeminate for a man
to put clothes in a gentle cycle?

311
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,069
What about fine fabrics? How do you
deal with that kind of temperament?

312
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,509
What about stonewashing?
You ever witness one of those?

313
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,151
That must be something. What, do they
just pummel the jeans with rocks?

314
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,560
I didn't realize it was a full box.

315
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,476
I'm gonna count to three.

316
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,835
If you don't give up the chair...

317
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,560
...the wig is coming off.

318
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,674
I don't wear a wig.

319
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,431
One...

320
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,430
No, I'm sorry.
I don't really have a phone.

321
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,352
In fact, I don't really have
an apartment.

322
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,511
I kind of sleep around.

323
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,158
I just like to have a few drinks...

324
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,914
...and then just let the guy do
whatever he wants.

325
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,510
Would you close your eyes
a second?

326
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,274
I want to tell you a secret
about my bra.

327
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,557
Hello, Rick.

328
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,153
Hey, look who's here.

329
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,709
That's right, Ricky boy, it's me.

330
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,077
You know something, Costanza,
I'm a very lucky man.

331
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,389
I've always been lucky.

332
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,552
Things just to seem to fall
right in my lap.

333
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,033
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

334
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,556
In fact, I'm glad you're here,
you know.

335
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,995
Maybe I've been
a little rough on you.

336
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,071
Why should we let
personal differences...

337
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,514
...get in the way of business?

338
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,955
I... I want you to come back.

339
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:10,591
And you can use my bathroom
anytime you want.

340
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,154
- You want me to come back?
- Yeah.

341
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,117
Hey, how about a toast, huh?

342
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,475
- Everybody, a toast!
- Rick.

343
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,551
Everyone, I want to propose a toast...

344
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,075
...to 1 0 great years
at Rick Barr Properties...

345
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,879
- Rick.
...and all the people in this room...

346
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,758
...that made that possible.
- Rick.

347
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,229
I'd also like to welcome back
into the fold...

348
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,790
...our little, shrimpy friend,
George Costanza...

349
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,270
...who, although he really didn't have
a very good year...

350
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,000
How you blew that McConnell deal,
I'll never know...

351
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,071
...but, hey, what the hell, huh?

352
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,310
We've always enjoyed his antics
around the office.

353
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,951
Anything you want to add to this?

354
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,392
Drink up!

355
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,000
I like history, the Civil War.

356
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,035
Maybe I could be a professor
or something.

357
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:11,197
Well, to teach something,
you really have to know a lot about it.

358
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,276
- I think you need a degree.
- Yeah, that's true.

359
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,550
- Hey, don't...
- What?

360
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,398
Oh, my God, the money.

361
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,394
- The 1 500, where'd you find it?
- It was in my laundry.

362
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,918
In your laundry? The whole time?

363
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,508
I told you not to mix in our guys.

364
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,635
What did we figure the damage
on that machine would be?

365
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,919
It was about 1 200 bucks.

366
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,038
Kramer!

367
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,191
That's Newman.

368
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,635
I'm on the roof!

369
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,076
Well? What are you waiting for?

370
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,311
Elaine, take a walk with me
to the Laundromat.

371
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,152
I got to pay this guy the money.

372
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,717
I like horses.
Maybe I could be a stable boy.

373
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,599
You want to shoot some pool tonight?

374
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,115
I can't. I'm going to a movie!

375
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,916
Nah, it's probably a union thing.

376
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,190
People like the idea of revenge.

377
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,511
You ever hear the expression:
"The best revenge is living well"?

378
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,990
I've said this. In other words,
it means, supposedly...

379
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,752
...the best way to
get back at someone...

380
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,071
...is by being happy and successful
in your own life.

381
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,835
Sounds nice. Doesn't really work
on that Charles Bronson kind of level.

382
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,072
You know, those movies where
his whole family gets wiped out...

383
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,754
...by some street scum.
You think you could go up to him:

384
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,549
" Charlie, forget the.357. You need
a custom-made suit and a convertible...

385
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,676
...new carpeting,
French doors, a divan.

386
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,400
That'll show those punks."

387
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,869
