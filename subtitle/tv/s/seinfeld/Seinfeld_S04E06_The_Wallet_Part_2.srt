1
00:00:02,506 --> 00:00:04,303
Here's what happened last week.

2
00:00:04,474 --> 00:00:07,671
George and I went up to NBC, and
we told them the idea for the series.

3
00:00:07,844 --> 00:00:09,072
We're waiting to sign the contract.

4
00:00:09,246 --> 00:00:12,181
- Jerry, I want you to sign that contract.
- We're gonna sign it.

5
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:14,442
In fact, George is out with
the woman from NBC right now.

6
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:16,449
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to pass.

7
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:19,680
- You're passing?
- Well, it's much too low.

8
00:00:19,856 --> 00:00:21,721
That's it for this piece of junk.
I've had it.

9
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:24,190
- Is it the one your parents gave you?
- It never works.

10
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:26,386
- Where's that watch we bought you?
- It's at the jeweler.

11
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:28,030
I would like somebody to hit me.

12
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:29,893
What's the matter
with this Davola guy?

13
00:00:30,066 --> 00:00:31,363
He's after Jerry now.

14
00:00:31,535 --> 00:00:35,062
I never had a back problem until that
night I slept on the convertible sofa.

15
00:00:36,806 --> 00:00:39,570
Cuban cigars.
It's a present from my father.

16
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:40,937
- Here you go.
- What, cigars?

17
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:42,100
Yeah, Cubans.

18
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:46,777
- What's wrong?
- The Velcro.

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,714
I can't stand Velcro.
That tearing sound.

20
00:00:49,886 --> 00:00:52,252
Now, listen to me. I'm negotiating.

21
00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:55,721
Negotiation.
This is what you do in business.

22
00:00:55,892 --> 00:00:57,723
- Leave all my stuff here?
- Leave it.

23
00:00:57,894 --> 00:00:59,725
Tell us about the trip.
How's Dr. Reston?

24
00:00:59,896 --> 00:01:01,488
He has this power over me, okay?

25
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:05,123
He has this way of manipulating
every little word that I say.

26
00:01:05,302 --> 00:01:07,133
He's like a Svenjolly.

27
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:09,966
Tell this guy you're seeing somebody
else. That's the easiest way.

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,267
His name is Kramer.

29
00:01:12,442 --> 00:01:14,342
I want you to tell this young man
to give me a call.

30
00:01:14,511 --> 00:01:17,002
My wallet's gone! My wallet's gone!

31
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,169
Where did you get that watch?

32
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:20,642
I found it in the garbage can.

33
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:24,446
What kind of an idiot throws away
a perfectly good watch?

34
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:29,016
It's an entire industry of bad gifts,
all those executive gifts.

35
00:01:30,594 --> 00:01:33,427
Any stupid, goofy, brass,
wood thing.

36
00:01:33,597 --> 00:01:35,758
They put a piece of green felt
on the bottom.

37
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:40,102
"It's a golf, desk, tie
and stress organizer, Dad."

38
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:43,467
Well, to me, nothing compares
with the paperweight as a bad gift.

39
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,803
There's no better way than a
paperweight to express to someone...

40
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:50,276
...that, "I refuse to put any thought
into this at all."

41
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:55,750
Where are these people working that
papers are blowing right off of desks?

42
00:01:55,919 --> 00:02:00,117
Are the desks screwed to the back of a
flatbed truck going down the highway?

43
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,622
Are they typing in the crow's-nest
of a clipper ship?

44
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:04,316
What do you need
a paperweight for?

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,395
I don't understand this jeweler,
Jimmy Sherman.

46
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,903
He brings a watch, takes over a week
to fix it. He fixed yours in one day.

47
00:02:17,073 --> 00:02:19,541
Oh, you know these jewelers.
They're enigmas.

48
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:22,337
They're mysteries wrapped
in a riddle.

49
00:02:24,014 --> 00:02:26,175
- She's very attractive.
- She's okay.

50
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:27,976
- Just okay?
- She's nice.

51
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:30,210
- She's better than nice.
- She's all right.

52
00:02:30,387 --> 00:02:32,480
- She's beautiful.
- She's not beautiful.

53
00:02:32,656 --> 00:02:35,284
- I think she's beautiful.
- So you ask her out.

54
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:37,085
- I'm not gonna ask her out.
- Why not?

55
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,660
If you don't think she's beautiful,
something's wrong.

56
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,820
She's pretty. She's not beautiful.

57
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:44,728
I should drop dead
if she's not beautiful.

58
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:48,667
- I think that's a little extreme.
- She's all right.

59
00:02:48,838 --> 00:02:52,604
Two exact same watches.
He tells you a week and him a day.

60
00:02:52,776 --> 00:02:54,641
How could that be?

61
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:56,540
Something's fishy about this.

62
00:02:58,114 --> 00:02:59,513
He said what?

63
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:02,516
- "The hell with them."
- "The hell with them"?

64
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:06,555
- Those were his exact words.
- Oh, boy.

65
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:10,215
He said, "We've got 500 shows
to choose from.

66
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:15,353
Why should we give two guys with
no idea or experience more money?"

67
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:17,523
He was pretty emphatic?

68
00:03:17,701 --> 00:03:20,226
- He pounded on his desk.
- He pounded?

69
00:03:20,403 --> 00:03:22,769
I told you to take the offer.

70
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:27,000
Look, I had nothing to do with this.
It wasn't my decision.

71
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:30,641
It was Jerry. Jerry told me.
I'm the creative guy.

72
00:03:30,814 --> 00:03:33,715
- He handles the business end.
- You said it was insulting.

73
00:03:33,883 --> 00:03:38,286
I was quoting him. Why would I be
insulted? I'm never insulted.

74
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:41,947
You could call me "baldy," dump soup
on my head. Nothing insults me.

75
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:45,356
- Well, there's nothing I can do.
- Don't they make a counteroffer?

76
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:49,055
How can he just cancel the deal?
What kind of a maniac is this guy?

77
00:03:49,232 --> 00:03:52,565
- He just says no, and that's it?
- Yeah, that's the way Russell is.

78
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:55,705
- He doesn't like to play games.
- He has to play. He can't not play.

79
00:03:55,872 --> 00:03:57,430
We're playing.

80
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,767
I gotta see him.
How do I get in touch with him?

81
00:03:59,976 --> 00:04:02,809
- You'll have to wait till Monday.
- No. I can't wait till Monday.

82
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:06,005
That's impossible. I gotta talk
to him now. Where does he live?

83
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:08,412
I can't give you his address.

84
00:04:09,018 --> 00:04:12,215
- Give me that address.
- Hey, give me that!

85
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:17,555
He just wants to talk to you.
I couldn't talk him out of it.

86
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:22,289
So you just tell him that you're my
boyfriend and that we're in love, okay?

87
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:24,660
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, I'm your boyfriend. Yeah.

88
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:28,167
- Okay.
- Have we been intimate?

89
00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:32,100
Yeah. Yeah, we've been intimate.

90
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:34,709
All right, how often do we do it?

91
00:04:35,845 --> 00:04:38,712
Kramer, how is that important?
Honestly, do you really think...

92
00:04:38,882 --> 00:04:40,873
...he's going to ask...?
- He's a psychiatrist.

93
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,143
They're interested in stuff like that.

94
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,254
All right. All right. We do it...

95
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:49,117
...five times a week, okay?

96
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:52,225
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, my...

97
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:55,154
All right, listen.

98
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,731
- Just tell me what you'll say.
- I know what to say.

99
00:04:57,901 --> 00:05:01,029
- No, but I would like to hear it.
- I don't wanna say it out loud.

100
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:04,833
It kills the spontaneity. You know,
Gleason, he never rehearsed.

101
00:05:05,308 --> 00:05:07,469
- Go ahead. Do it.
- Okay. You talk to him.

102
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:09,805
- I'll talk to him.
- Hey, how's your hair?

103
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,844
Well, yeah, it's good.

104
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:15,974
You're not the type who should be
playing with matches, seriously.

105
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:20,748
Yes. Dr. Reston.

106
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,690
Is he in?

107
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:26,226
Well, this is Kramer,
and he's expecting my call.

108
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,735
- Is he?
- Yes, yes, Dr. Reston.

109
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:43,035
Well, hello there.

110
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:46,614
- Well, I'm a good friend of Elaine's.
- No, no, not friends.

111
00:05:46,783 --> 00:05:51,447
We're actually... We're not friends.
We're much more than friends.

112
00:05:51,754 --> 00:05:56,316
And... I'm afraid
we have a bit of a problem.

113
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:59,689
Well, the point is doctor,
I'm very much in love with Elaine...

114
00:05:59,863 --> 00:06:04,095
...and she's very much in love
with me, and, well...

115
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:08,067
...we would appreciate it if
you would cease and desist...

116
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:11,105
...and allow us to pursue
our courtship unfettered.

117
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:16,472
If not, I can assure you, doctor, that I
can make things unpleasant for you...

118
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:20,309
...and your staff, if you have one.

119
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:25,118
Yes. Yeah, but the point that l...

120
00:06:27,557 --> 00:06:31,391
Well, no. Well, yeah, that's...
It's possible.

121
00:06:33,263 --> 00:06:36,755
Well, I suppose I could, but I'd
have to shift a few things around.

122
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:41,827
Wait. Hold on for a second, will you?
Go ahead. Yeah.

123
00:06:42,472 --> 00:06:43,905
All right.

124
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:48,276
Yeah. Yeah. Well, okay.
I look forward to it too.

125
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:50,841
Okay, so long.

126
00:06:51,014 --> 00:06:53,141
What happened? What did he say?
What's going on?

127
00:06:53,316 --> 00:06:57,116
- Okay, he wants to get together.
- Get together?

128
00:06:57,287 --> 00:06:59,278
- Why?
- You know, he wants to talk.

129
00:06:59,455 --> 00:07:02,652
Why didn't you just say no?

130
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:06,888
That's interesting.

131
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:11,422
- Did you enjoy your croissant?
- It was different.

132
00:07:12,168 --> 00:07:14,534
- And how was yours?
- Oh, very good.

133
00:07:14,704 --> 00:07:17,138
Try our mousse.
It'll change your life expectancy.

134
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:20,341
No, thanks. Just the check.

135
00:07:23,713 --> 00:07:25,442
What's the matter with you?

136
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:27,715
- What?
- Why didn't you didn't flirt?

137
00:07:27,884 --> 00:07:29,476
- Come on.
- She was flirting with you.

138
00:07:29,686 --> 00:07:31,813
- Why didn't you say something?
- What would I say?

139
00:07:31,988 --> 00:07:34,957
- You just sat there.
- Well, you made me uncomfortable.

140
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:38,321
You're a comedian. Couldn't you
come up with something?

141
00:07:38,895 --> 00:07:41,864
- Where's the bathroom?
- In the back, on your right.

142
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:48,562
- Dad.
- Will you stop it. Jerry, let go.

143
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:50,933
- Jerry.
- Would you let me pay just once?

144
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:53,974
- You're out of your mind.
- You don't even have a wallet.

145
00:07:54,143 --> 00:07:55,872
- Don't worry about it.
- What'll you do?

146
00:07:56,045 --> 00:07:58,036
What's the difference?
We'll figure it out.

147
00:07:58,214 --> 00:08:01,308
- You're not paying.
- All right, fine. You figure it out.

148
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:04,248
I'd be curious to know how you
pick up a check with no money.

149
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,287
Because if this works, the whole
monetary system's obsolete.

150
00:08:07,457 --> 00:08:09,652
We're back to wampum.

151
00:08:10,026 --> 00:08:12,051
I'm going to the bathroom.

152
00:08:13,096 --> 00:08:15,929
How the hell am I gonna pay
for this?

153
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:24,031
They give you some portion here,
huh?

154
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:28,807
Uncle Leo, I hope I wasn't rude that
day I bumped into you on the street.

155
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,379
- I really did have to get to a meeting.
- Oh, no, no, I understand.

156
00:08:32,548 --> 00:08:34,345
I got plenty of friends
in show business.

157
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,508
I know you're all very busy.

158
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:39,314
So you found that watch
in a garbage can, huh?

159
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:43,619
Yeah. In fact, it was right after
I ran into you.

160
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:46,727
You know, a friend of mine
has a watch just like that.

161
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:49,364
I'd love to replace it for him as a gift.

162
00:08:49,532 --> 00:08:52,501
Well, I haven't seen
too many like these.

163
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:54,829
Yeah, I know.

164
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:57,932
Maybe you wanna sell me that one?

165
00:08:58,107 --> 00:09:00,632
Oh, sure.

166
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:07,247
Hang on a second.
I got a little proposition for you.

167
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:12,477
There is a George Bonanza
to see you.

168
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:16,147
- Costanza. Costanza.
- George Costanza.

169
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:18,793
The guy who pitched the show
with stories about nothing.

170
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:22,624
- Jerry Seinfeld's friend.
- Seinfeld friend.

171
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,029
He says call him Monday.

172
00:09:26,502 --> 00:09:29,938
Mr. Dalrymple, I have to talk to you.
It's about the show.

173
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:35,042
It was all a terrible misunderstanding.
Just five minutes of your time.

174
00:09:35,645 --> 00:09:38,045
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Dalrymple.

175
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:41,277
Very good, sir.

176
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:45,248
You don't understand.
I can't allow my son to pay for me.

177
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:49,152
Look, as soon as I get back to Florida,
I promise you, I'll mail you a check.

178
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:52,488
Why don't you just let him pay,
and then you can pay him back.

179
00:09:52,662 --> 00:09:54,960
- No, no. He won't let me do that.
- Why don't you...

180
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:57,463
...put the money in his pants
pocket unsuspectingly?

181
00:09:57,633 --> 00:10:01,000
- He could wash them.
- We are running a reputable business.

182
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,264
Don't tell me about business.
I sold raincoats for 35 years.

183
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,137
- But you did not give them away.
- You don't understand...

184
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:11,439
I cannot get involved with you
and your family.

185
00:10:11,614 --> 00:10:13,878
Okay, now, look. Don't take too long.

186
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,245
Look at this building.
What is this?

187
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:18,216
I don't know. It's a building.

188
00:10:18,387 --> 00:10:21,049
- The doors are on a diagonal.
- So what?

189
00:10:21,524 --> 00:10:24,186
It's architecturally incorrect.

190
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:27,085
Just go.

191
00:10:33,336 --> 00:10:36,305
Is this a bad time?
I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

192
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:38,872
We were about to sit down to dinner.

193
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:48,840
- This is Cynthia.
- Oh, hi. Hi. Nice to meet you.

194
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:51,820
- What are you having? Veal?
- No.

195
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:54,821
- Looks like veal.
- It's not veal.

196
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:58,257
Well, it's a good-looking
piece of meat.

197
00:10:58,628 --> 00:11:00,994
Wow, this is some place.
A duplex, huh?

198
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:03,997
Look, stairs in an apartment.
All my life I dreamed about...

199
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:08,103
...having steps in an apartment.
Even one step. Sunken living room.

200
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:11,231
Although one step is not
all that sunken.

201
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:16,638
- Who gave you my address?
- No, that's a fair question. It is.

202
00:11:18,114 --> 00:11:20,412
Jerry. Yeah. Jerry's a friend of mine.

203
00:11:20,883 --> 00:11:24,546
He gave it to me. Unbelievable
how many addresses this guy has.

204
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,247
He's got Marlon Brando's. I could go
to Marlon Brando's house if I wanted.

205
00:11:28,424 --> 00:11:33,589
Of course, I wouldn't. The guy is...
Obviously, the guy has his problems.

206
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:36,363
So you wanna talk about the show?

207
00:11:36,532 --> 00:11:38,557
Well, you know,
it's really very funny.

208
00:11:38,734 --> 00:11:41,498
Because, you know what we
got here, really?

209
00:11:41,671 --> 00:11:44,105
We really just have a terrible
misunderstanding. See...

210
00:11:44,273 --> 00:11:47,709
...when I passed on the deal, I thought
that's what Jerry wanted me to say.

211
00:11:47,877 --> 00:11:51,711
- I misinterpreted.
- Russell, where's the TV Guide?

212
00:11:51,881 --> 00:11:54,475
What time is it? 8:30. I'll tell you
what's on. You got...

213
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,244
...Major Dad, Blossom...
Very funny program.

214
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,718
- Blossom's on Monday.
- Are you sure?

215
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,881
Look who I'm talking to.
The president of NBC.

216
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:08,463
Mr. Costanza, it's too late anyway. I
made a deal with another writing team.

217
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:11,725
All right, look.
We're people, you and me.

218
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:14,426
Businessmen, colleagues, if I may.

219
00:12:14,604 --> 00:12:17,300
Let's not quibble.
We'll do it for the $ 13,000.

220
00:12:17,473 --> 00:12:20,169
Thirteen thousand, and I never
came up here. We never talked.

221
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:22,743
You take good care.
It's nice seeing you again.

222
00:12:22,912 --> 00:12:25,176
- Nice meeting you. Cynthia, right?
- Now, look.

223
00:12:25,348 --> 00:12:27,873
These deals are already made.

224
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,245
All right. Let me just say this.

225
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:33,655
Ten thousand dollars. I'm going
below what you wanted to pay.

226
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:36,849
You're having your dinner. Have your
veal or whatever it is. Enjoy.

227
00:12:37,026 --> 00:12:39,221
- Mr. Costanza.
- All right. That's it.

228
00:12:39,395 --> 00:12:44,094
All right. Good, $8000.
Cynthia, again, nice meeting you.

229
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:48,101
Have I commented on the shoes?
I love suede. It's so thick and rich.

230
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:51,468
Do you ever rub it against the grain?

231
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:55,043
Russell, can we eat?

232
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:00,606
- All right, 8000.
- You made Jerry very happy.

233
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:11,386
Could I just use your bathroom
for a moment?

234
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:16,564
All right, 200. That's as high as I can
go. I think you're being unreasonable.

235
00:13:16,732 --> 00:13:20,293
Jerry, I'd give you the watch.
It's not the money. I happen to like it.

236
00:13:20,469 --> 00:13:23,666
Look, I happen to know how much
that watch costs. It's a $60 watch.

237
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,364
You paid 40 to get it fixed.
That's $ 100.

238
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:30,808
- I'm offering you 200.
- I never seen a band like this.

239
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,679
All right, 300. Plus 50 for the repair.
Three-fifty, that's it.

240
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:37,648
Do you have it on you?

241
00:13:38,387 --> 00:13:40,252
Yeah, I think I do.

242
00:13:40,756 --> 00:13:43,816
This is unbelievable.

243
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:47,923
What the hell is going on here?

244
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,498
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.

245
00:13:56,672 --> 00:13:58,765
- Thank you for coming in.
- Thank you.

246
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:01,034
- Please sit down.
- Alrighty.

247
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:16,486
Could I offer you something to drink?
Coffee, anything?

248
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:21,858
Okay, yeah. I'll have a...
Do you have a decaf cappuccino?

249
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,829
I don't think we have that.

250
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:28,568
Well, that's a little strange.

251
00:14:28,738 --> 00:14:34,040
- Why does that surprise you?
- Well, it's a very popular drink.

252
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:38,037
- This is an office.
- That's true.

253
00:14:38,748 --> 00:14:41,683
- But, you know, I can't help but think...
- So tell me, Mr. Kramer...

254
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:43,250
Okay, sure.

255
00:14:43,786 --> 00:14:46,949
Tell me all about you and Elaine.

256
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:49,683
Oh, alrighty...

257
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:54,863
Well, what we have here,
doctor, is...

258
00:14:55,264 --> 00:14:58,756
...an extraordinary situation.
- Is it?

259
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:00,765
Oh, you'd better believe it.

260
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,770
You really have a terrible voice.

261
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:15,041
Do I know you?

262
00:15:15,251 --> 00:15:18,277
- I don't think so.
- Because you really look familiar.

263
00:15:18,888 --> 00:15:21,618
Oh, well, maybe you've seen me.
My face is on...

264
00:15:22,124 --> 00:15:25,093
...Mount Rushmore.
- Yes, of course. That's it.

265
00:15:25,261 --> 00:15:28,594
I guess I'm just used to seeing
it on a much larger scale.

266
00:15:28,764 --> 00:15:31,631
Oh, yeah, right.
I replaced Teddy Roosevelt.

267
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:33,268
Oh, really?

268
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:37,130
Trustbuster. Bust this.

269
00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:46,671
You know, I never thought of it
like that before, doctor.

270
00:15:46,849 --> 00:15:50,410
- You are absolutely right.
- I'm glad we agree.

271
00:15:50,719 --> 00:15:53,085
Would you like a cigar?
They're Cubans.

272
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:55,314
- I'd love one.
- Yeah.

273
00:15:55,491 --> 00:16:00,019
I think Elaine is a wonderful woman.
You two will make a wonderful couple.

274
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:04,462
If you ever feel...

275
00:16:05,034 --> 00:16:07,468
...you need to talk to someone...

276
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,231
...about anything,
you have my number.

277
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:12,640
Well, that's very kind of you.

278
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:16,534
These are good, huh?

279
00:16:26,355 --> 00:16:30,348
I cannot believe I'm doing this.
I never meet people like this.

280
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:34,792
- You're not a nut, are you?
- No, I don't think so.

281
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:41,428
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I never do stuff like this.

282
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:46,041
Really? I give my number to just about
every customer who comes in here.

283
00:16:46,642 --> 00:16:48,576
- You don't seem that desperate.
- Oh, yeah.

284
00:16:48,744 --> 00:16:53,113
Actually I'm a little disappointed.
I kind of had my eye on Uncle Leo.

285
00:16:54,016 --> 00:16:56,644
Well, I'll give you a call,
and thanks for the fish.

286
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:59,049
- You know why fish are so thin?
- Why?

287
00:16:59,221 --> 00:17:01,246
They eat fish.

288
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:25,880
- Hey.
- What happened?

289
00:17:26,048 --> 00:17:28,073
- What took you so long?
- He's a terrific guy.

290
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,650
What are you talking about?
What did he say?

291
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:33,845
- We talked about a lot of things.
- You talked about a lot of things.

292
00:17:34,023 --> 00:17:36,048
Well, did you talk about us?

293
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,489
I'm in love. I just met her outside
in the street. Her name's Elaine.

294
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:44,861
She is the most beautiful
woman I have ever seen.

295
00:17:45,534 --> 00:17:47,434
Did you say Elaine?

296
00:17:48,571 --> 00:17:51,836
How come with the psychiatrist,
every "the hour" is only 50 minutes?

297
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:54,938
What do they do with that
10 minutes that they have left?

298
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,546
Do they just sit there going,
"Boy, that guy was crazy.

299
00:17:59,448 --> 00:18:03,111
I couldn't believe the things
he was saying. What a nut.

300
00:18:03,285 --> 00:18:06,186
Who's coming in next?
Oh, no, another headcase."

301
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:12,122
- You should've told me it didn't work.
- I know, I know.

302
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:15,593
- You didn't have to throw it out.
- I was always late. It was frustrating.

303
00:18:15,764 --> 00:18:17,698
I'm sorry. I really am.

304
00:18:17,866 --> 00:18:20,528
- That must be Leo.
- I would've taken you to the airport.

305
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:22,967
- He has nothing to do.
- Neither do I.

306
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:24,772
- Yeah?
- It's George.

307
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,669
Come on up. It's George.

308
00:18:26,842 --> 00:18:29,709
- Oh, George.
- Whatever happened with NBC?

309
00:18:30,145 --> 00:18:33,273
- George turned it down.
- He turned it down?

310
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:35,883
- Why did he do that?
- Because of Ted Danson.

311
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:39,782
- What does he have to do with it?
- Maybe he doesn't like Ted Danson.

312
00:18:39,955 --> 00:18:42,446
Who knows? Maybe we'll wind
up getting more money.

313
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:45,155
- Hey.
- Hey, Georgie boy. How are you?

314
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:47,192
Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.
How are you?

315
00:18:47,363 --> 00:18:49,627
What's the matter with you?

316
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:52,797
- What did I do?
- What about NBC? Hear anything?

317
00:18:52,968 --> 00:18:55,232
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.

318
00:18:55,938 --> 00:18:58,236
We got a deal.

319
00:19:00,542 --> 00:19:03,602
You see, he had the right idea.
Hold out.

320
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:05,872
That's how you get the big money,
huh, George?

321
00:19:06,048 --> 00:19:09,245
- Please, Morty.
- He knows how to talk to these people.

322
00:19:09,418 --> 00:19:11,750
No one's gonna take advantage
of Georgie.

323
00:19:12,087 --> 00:19:14,885
I'm just happy to be working
with your talented son...

324
00:19:15,057 --> 00:19:18,959
...who is not doing this for the money.
That is so refreshing.

325
00:19:19,128 --> 00:19:21,153
- So, what did we get?
- Eight thousand dollars.

326
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:25,130
- Beautiful.
- That's for the two of us.

327
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,162
- Four thousand apiece?
- Let me see if I understand this.

328
00:19:29,338 --> 00:19:33,365
In other words,
you held out for less money.

329
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:37,471
- I was wrong. You were right.
- The basic idea of negotiation...

330
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:42,242
...as I understand it
is to get your price to go up.

331
00:19:43,052 --> 00:19:45,646
- You're smart. I'm dumb.
- This is how they negotiate...

332
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:48,449
...in the Bizarro World.

333
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:50,683
That's gotta be Leo.

334
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:52,793
- Yeah.
- It's Leo.

335
00:19:52,961 --> 00:19:55,395
- All right, we're coming down.
- Let's get going.

336
00:19:55,564 --> 00:19:59,295
Dad, before we go,
I got a little something for you.

337
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:01,629
- A present.
- A present?

338
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:07,907
Hey, look at this, a wallet.
Exactly what I needed.

339
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:10,045
- You see?
- Come on, you lost your wallet.

340
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:13,181
- I figured I'd get you another.
- I hope you didn't spend too much.

341
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:16,806
This is one of the most thoughtful
gifts anyone's ever given me.

342
00:20:16,985 --> 00:20:20,819
- He's something, your son, isn't he?
- All right. Let's go.

343
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:24,015
- You're a terrific kid.
- Yeah, he's something, isn't he?

344
00:20:24,193 --> 00:20:26,661
How can anybody not like you?

345
00:20:27,096 --> 00:20:29,030
- You're very special.
- Yeah.

346
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:31,666
I'm good for about $4000.

347
00:20:32,434 --> 00:20:37,371
- Hey, let's go. It's 12:22.
- All right, Leo.

348
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:40,440
- Hey, Uncle Leo. How you doing?
- Hi, hi. I got it.

349
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:43,510
This is some beautiful parking spot
you've got here.

350
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,647
- I hate to give it up.
- Yeah.

351
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:47,714
Dad, you're sure you don't
need more money?

352
00:20:47,883 --> 00:20:50,215
- Jerry.
- All right, I'm just joking.

353
00:20:50,385 --> 00:20:51,943
Listen, have a nice trip.

354
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:56,251
- Bye, Mrs. Seinfeld. Take care.
- Thanks again for the wallet.

355
00:20:56,425 --> 00:20:58,757
- Morty, always a pleasure.
- Yes.

356
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:01,259
Take care, now. So long.

357
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,057
- Yeah, like he'd take your money.
- He took it. I put $400 in the wallet.

358
00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:09,068
He lost all that cash. It was the
only way I could give it back.

359
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:13,971
- Otherwise, he wouldn't accept it.
- I'd love to see the look on his face.

360
00:21:16,378 --> 00:21:18,403
- You believe this?
- What?

361
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,741
- It's Velcro.
- You're kidding.

362
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:24,818
Who needs this? Leo, let's go.

363
00:21:39,134 --> 00:21:43,537
The main difference between women's
and men's wallets is the photo section.

364
00:21:44,006 --> 00:21:47,840
True? Women carry with them a photo
of every person they've ever met...

365
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,173
...every day in their whole life
since the beginning of time.

366
00:21:51,346 --> 00:21:53,541
Every picture's out of date.
You know what I mean?

367
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:57,048
"Here's my cousin, 3 years old.
She's in the Marines now.

368
00:21:57,219 --> 00:22:00,985
This is my dog. He died during
the Johnson administration."

369
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,881
You get stopped by a cop.
No license, no registration.

370
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:06,220
"Here's 56 people that know me."

371
00:22:07,196 --> 00:22:10,757
Cop goes, "Just wanted to make sure
you had some friends. Move it along.

372
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:13,267
Routine pal check."
