1
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:03,427
The concept behind the car phone...

2
00:00:04,853 --> 00:00:06,914
...speakerphone, airline phone,
portable phone...

3
00:00:07,077 --> 00:00:09,030
...pay phone, cordless phone,
multiline phone...

4
00:00:09,187 --> 00:00:10,791
...the phone pager, the call waiting...

5
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:14,787
...call forwarding, conferencing, speed
dialling, direct dialling and redialling...

6
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:17,396
...is that we all have
absolutely nothing to say...

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,386
...and we've got to talk to someone
about it right now.

8
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:23,302
Cannot wait another second.

9
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:25,214
You're at home, you're on the phone.

10
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:26,520
You're in the car making calls.

11
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,250
You get to work,
"Any messages for me?"

12
00:00:28,406 --> 00:00:32,541
You gotta give people
a chance to miss you a little!

13
00:00:36,883 --> 00:00:39,720
It's bad enough you have a car phone.
You have to use the speak er?

14
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:43,666
It's safer. Plus, it's more annoying
to the other person.

15
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:46,694
- Oh, look at this guy.
- What's going on?

16
00:00:46,857 --> 00:00:49,540
A guy's trying to get in front of me,
has to ask permission. Yes.

17
00:00:49,695 --> 00:00:51,681
Go ahead. Get in, get in.

18
00:00:52,572 --> 00:00:55,180
- Did you get a thank-you wave?
- No, nothing.

19
00:00:55,334 --> 00:00:56,938
How could you not
give a thank-you wave?

20
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,936
Hey, buddy, where's
my thank-you wave?

21
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:02,421
Give me that wave!

22
00:01:03,352 --> 00:01:05,882
- Hey, Jerry, are you free on Friday?
- Yeah, I'm free. Why?

23
00:01:06,037 --> 00:01:09,103
Oh, God. I bumped into
Robin Sandusky today.

24
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:11,867
She asked me to have dinner
with her and her husband.

25
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:13,668
Oh, my God.

26
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:16,770
You won't believe what I saw.
A car just bashed into a parked car...

27
00:01:16,931 --> 00:01:18,611
...and sped off, right on my block.

28
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:21,912
- You've got to follow that car.
- What?

29
00:01:22,071 --> 00:01:25,017
- You can't let him get away with that.
- The guy could be dangerous.

30
00:01:25,524 --> 00:01:28,895
- What are you, yellow?
- I'm not yellow.

31
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,419
Jerry, if you don't follow him,
you're yellow.

32
00:01:32,582 --> 00:01:34,415
- Wait. He stopped. He's parking.
- What?

33
00:01:34,577 --> 00:01:36,257
What? I can't hear you. Jerry?

34
00:01:37,952 --> 00:01:39,479
Excuse me.

35
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,128
I was driving behind you, you know...

36
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:45,004
...a few blocks back, and l...
I couldn't...

37
00:01:45,164 --> 00:01:47,619
...help... Maybe you didn't realize l...

38
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:49,758
l... I witnessed that...

39
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:53,754
...your... Your left rear tire's
a little low.

40
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,314
That can affect the performance
of the twin l-beam suspension...

41
00:01:57,477 --> 00:02:01,197
...not to mention, you know,
your rack-and-pinion steering.

42
00:02:05,073 --> 00:02:08,171
So I wound up going out
for a decaf cappuccino with her.

43
00:02:09,177 --> 00:02:11,010
Boy, what a story.

44
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:14,384
I'm speechless, speechless.
I have no speech.

45
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,535
You know, I really liked her.
We talked, we flirted.

46
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:22,677
And when she laughed,
she'd reach out and touch my arm.

47
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,623
Love when they touch your arm.
I can't get enough of that.

48
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:29,505
- Me either.
- Why is that?

49
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,112
Let's not even analyse it.

50
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:35,025
- So you didn't turn her in.
- I couldn't go though with it.

51
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:37,444
- You gonna see her again?
- Friday night.

52
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:39,317
- Yeah.
- It's me.

53
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:40,856
Come on up.

54
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:45,387
By the way, Elaine does not
need to know about anything.

55
00:02:45,543 --> 00:02:47,572
Hey, hey, hey.

56
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:49,563
I dig.

57
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:52,445
- Oh, you dig?
- Yes.

58
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:55,056
- I see enormous potential here.
- Why?

59
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,613
Because great couples always have
a great story about how they met.

60
00:02:58,777 --> 00:03:00,991
That's why I've never been in
a long-term relationship.

61
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:02,497
I never had a good meeting story.

62
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:04,943
I wonder if I'm nuts
for pursuing this woman at all.

63
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:06,251
I don't think so.

64
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,549
Look, she slammed
into a parked car.

65
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:11,778
She took no responsibility for
mutilating the property of a stranger...

66
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:14,618
...and then she sped off
like a criminal.

67
00:03:15,617 --> 00:03:18,072
On the other hand...

68
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:20,560
...should she never be
allowed to date again?

69
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,250
Scratch one car and you're
forbidden to have social contact...

70
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:25,356
...for the rest of your life?

71
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:28,310
What am I drinking, milk?

72
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:32,108
- Hey.
- Hi.

73
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:33,410
- Sweater.
- Thank you.

74
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:36,024
So? What happened?

75
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:38,207
- With what?
- With the car.

76
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:39,466
What car?

77
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,775
The hit-and-run.

78
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:44,535
Oh, right, right, right.

79
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:45,839
Well...

80
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:47,907
...actually, the guy
went into Queens.

81
00:03:48,453 --> 00:03:49,598
Queens?

82
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:52,321
- You followed him over the bridge?
- Over the bridge.

83
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:54,663
Oh, l... I didn't know you
went into Queens, Jerry.

84
00:03:55,128 --> 00:03:57,037
Yeah, Queens.

85
00:03:57,353 --> 00:03:59,108
So? Then what?

86
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:03,252
He gets out of the car. I said,
"Hey, buddy, I saw you hit that car."

87
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:04,940
So he says to me:

88
00:04:05,101 --> 00:04:07,054
"What are you gonna do about it?"

89
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:09,971
So I said to him,
"Whatever's necessary."

90
00:04:13,042 --> 00:04:15,147
I am speechless.

91
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:17,258
I am without speech.

92
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,130
Tell her about the shoving.

93
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,625
What?

94
00:04:25,701 --> 00:04:27,424
What shoving?

95
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,949
- Oh, it was nothing.
- No.

96
00:04:30,112 --> 00:04:32,021
Tell her.

97
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,095
Come on. Tell me.

98
00:04:34,255 --> 00:04:36,393
Well, he kind of lost his temper...

99
00:04:36,556 --> 00:04:38,923
...and he was pushing me
up against the car...

100
00:04:39,088 --> 00:04:41,696
...so I went into a karate stance.

101
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:47,100
- You know karate?
- I know a little.

102
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:50,205
Well, l... This is so amazing to me.

103
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:52,089
Jerry, what did he do?

104
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:54,046
He backed off.

105
00:04:54,317 --> 00:04:56,957
He was pretty pathetic, actually.

106
00:04:58,575 --> 00:05:00,179
Hey.

107
00:05:01,068 --> 00:05:02,901
- Did you tell Kramer?
- No.

108
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:04,711
What, what? Tell me.

109
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:08,391
Jerry saw this guy smash into a car,
and he followed him.

110
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:11,001
Good for you.

111
00:05:11,234 --> 00:05:13,841
What kind of a sick lowlife
would do a thing like that?

112
00:05:13,996 --> 00:05:16,603
You know, those people,
you know they're mentally disturbed.

113
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:18,514
They should be sent to Australia.

114
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,628
- Australia?
- That's where England...

115
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:23,201
...used to send their convicts.

116
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,811
- But not anymore.
- No.

117
00:05:29,186 --> 00:05:30,637
Hey, Kramer?

118
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,445
Kramer.

119
00:05:33,176 --> 00:05:35,739
- What happened to you right here?
- I don't know.

120
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,539
You know, I was watching
Entertainment Tonight...

121
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:42,305
...and suddenly, you know,
I got dizzy...

122
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:45,830
...and the next thing I know,
I hit my head on the coffee table.

123
00:05:47,753 --> 00:05:50,971
- Well, that is... That is strange.
- Yeah, it's...

124
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:55,844
All right. Oh, Jerry, we're still on
for Friday night, right?

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,411
Oh, Friday. No, I can't.
I'm sorry. I have a date.

126
00:05:59,376 --> 00:06:02,627
- But last night you said you were free.
- We just met.

127
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,550
You know, maybe it was
a reaction to the sardines.

128
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:07,768
l... I can't go alone.

129
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,152
Ask George to go with you.

130
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:12,532
George, come on. I'll pay for you.

131
00:06:12,687 --> 00:06:13,832
You'll pay? I'm there.

132
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:18,280
- Why do you need anybody?
- Because...

133
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:21,507
...I hate being at a table alone
with a married couple...

134
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:25,263
...talking about their married friends
and their married furniture.

135
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:28,368
They're always trying to make me
feel like their life is so much better.

136
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:31,017
You know, I have a very exciting life.

137
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:32,856
It's very exciting.

138
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:36,811
You went out with a bullfighter?

139
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:39,725
Yeah, yeah.
Well, an ex-bullfighter now.

140
00:06:39,884 --> 00:06:42,371
- Wow.
- What was his name?

141
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:45,826
His name? His name was... Was...

142
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:48,591
...Eduardo...

143
00:06:48,745 --> 00:06:50,959
...Caroccio.

144
00:06:51,737 --> 00:06:53,417
Pass the salt, please.

145
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:55,227
Where did you meet him?

146
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:57,105
Actually, I met him in Switzerland...

147
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,213
...and he was fighting...

148
00:06:59,371 --> 00:07:02,283
Is that the word they use, "fighting"?
They don't really fight the bull.

149
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,661
They avoid fighting the bull.

150
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,268
Bread.

151
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:13,748
Oh, I just love meeting
new people, you know?

152
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:16,440
That's how you really
do learn about life.

153
00:07:21,696 --> 00:07:23,801
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

154
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:28,101
I wasn't gonna say anything, but I
saw he wasn't gonna open his mouth.

155
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:32,859
You know who's a good actor?
Anthony Quinn.

156
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:34,616
Oh, Anthony Quinn. Fine actor.

157
00:07:34,777 --> 00:07:36,916
But from what I understand,
not a very good driver.

158
00:07:37,309 --> 00:07:41,444
Hits everything on the road,
but always leaves a note.

159
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:43,285
Did you ever see Zorba the Greek?

160
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:44,744
Excellent film. In fact...

161
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:46,813
...Quinn said he never felt so good...

162
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:49,267
...as when he left a note
after smacking into a car.

163
00:07:50,351 --> 00:07:51,770
Come here.

164
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,642
Really, I was only kidding around.

165
00:07:53,804 --> 00:07:55,145
He was only joking, Michael.

166
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,755
You think you're special
because you say, "God bless you"?

167
00:07:57,908 --> 00:08:01,628
I don't think I'm special. My mother
always said I'm not special.

168
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:04,771
He was only joking, Michael.

169
00:08:04,928 --> 00:08:06,880
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, right.

170
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:09,100
- Take his side!
- I'm not taking his side.

171
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:13,365
- Well, whose side are you taking?
- Well, I'm not taking your side!

172
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:24,595
Kirk Douglas. Now, there's
another very bad driver.

173
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,254
But he's such an unbelievable guy...

174
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,362
...when he hits someone,
he doesn't leave a note.

175
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,810
He sits in his car
and waits for the other person...

176
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:33,920
...so he can exchange license,
registration and apologize.

177
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,170
I said, "God bless you."
Was that so wrong?

178
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:43,747
The question is...

179
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:46,040
...did you allow a space...

180
00:08:46,203 --> 00:08:48,767
...for the husband to come in
with his "God bless you"?

181
00:08:48,927 --> 00:08:51,490
Because as the husband,
he has the right of first refusal.

182
00:08:54,719 --> 00:08:55,864
- Yeah.
- It's me.

183
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:57,627
- Come on up.
- Yes.

184
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,511
Yes. I definitely waited.

185
00:08:59,668 --> 00:09:00,933
But let me say this.

186
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:03,040
Once he passes on that option...

187
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:05,684
...that "God bless you"
is up for grabs.

188
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:09,215
No argument, unless she's
one of these multiple sneezers...

189
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:11,587
...and he's holding his
"God bless you" in abeyance...

190
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,584
...until she completes the series.

191
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:17,119
I don't think she is
a multiple sneezer...

192
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:20,035
...because she sneezed again later
and it was also a single.

193
00:09:20,497 --> 00:09:22,068
What if she's having an off night?

194
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,703
- Hi.
- Hi.

195
00:09:26,865 --> 00:09:27,967
Well.

196
00:09:28,131 --> 00:09:30,083
If it isn't Mr. Gesundheit.

197
00:09:30,241 --> 00:09:32,499
Oh, yeah. Like there's
something wrong...

198
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:34,184
...with saying, "God bless you."

199
00:09:34,345 --> 00:09:36,450
I was raised to say, "God bless you."

200
00:09:37,107 --> 00:09:38,449
Shut up.

201
00:09:39,332 --> 00:09:41,820
What does it mean anyway,
"God bless you"?

202
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:44,466
It's a stupid "stuperstition."

203
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,120
A stupid what?

204
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,489
Whatever.

205
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:52,210
You wanna make a person feel better,
you shouldn't say, "God bless you."

206
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:55,396
You should say,
"You're so good-looking."

207
00:09:59,087 --> 00:10:02,535
Yeah. Yeah. That's better
than "God bless you."

208
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:06,526
Anyway, she left a message on my
machine. She wants you to call her.

209
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:08,864
- Who?
- Robin.

210
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,124
Why?

211
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:13,048
Well, I assume she called to apologize.
That's why she called me.

212
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:14,273
Entertainment Tonight is on.

213
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:16,079
- Where's the phone?
- Bedroom.

214
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:18,994
Hey, grab Jerry's sweater
for me, would you?

215
00:10:26,515 --> 00:10:29,122
Georgia peach Marla Maples
reportedly threw...

216
00:10:29,277 --> 00:10:32,572
...yet another stiletto heel at...

217
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:33,994
What's it like out?

218
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:35,796
It's chilly out.

219
00:10:37,754 --> 00:10:39,281
Should I take a sweater?

220
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:42,006
Yeah. You could take
a sweater if you want.

221
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,584
A scarf?

222
00:10:43,738 --> 00:10:47,568
No. Hey, shut this off.
Shut it off.

223
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:53,130
- What's the matter? What's going on?
- What happened?

224
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,275
- What?
- I think I hit my head again.

225
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,969
- What is wrong?
- Hey, hey, wait a minute.

226
00:10:58,123 --> 00:10:59,542
Let me ask you something, Kramer.

227
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:04,333
The last time you hit your head,
was Mary Hart on TV?

228
00:11:05,604 --> 00:11:07,284
- Yeah.
- That is it!

229
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:08,939
- What?
- That is it!

230
00:11:09,094 --> 00:11:11,309
Mary Hart's voice! Don't you see?

231
00:11:11,473 --> 00:11:13,578
There's something
about Mary Hart's voice...

232
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:15,339
...that's giving you seizures.

233
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,108
Just like... Just like...
Just like that woman in Albany!

234
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:19,789
Mary Hart!

235
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,089
- Oh, my God.
- What?

236
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,434
Well, she apologized,
and she wanted to know...

237
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:26,806
...if we could get together
Wednesday afternoon.

238
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,458
- Get together?
- Maybe she just wants to talk to me.

239
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:31,111
Married women don't get together.

240
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:32,761
They have affairs.

241
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,404
Oh, my God, an affair.

242
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:37,053
It's so adult.

243
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:43,461
It's like with stockings and martinis
and William Holden and...

244
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:48,409
On the other hand, it probably
wouldn't cost me any money.

245
00:11:50,024 --> 00:11:52,435
Are you actually considering this?

246
00:11:52,595 --> 00:11:55,158
I can't have an affair with a married
woman. That's despicable!

247
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:58,226
It's like hitting a car and driving away
without leaving a note.

248
00:11:58,502 --> 00:11:59,996
Yeah.

249
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,221
Hey, you know who owns that car?

250
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:04,361
- What car?
- The one that was hit the other night.

251
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:06,891
- Yeah, who?
- That blond across the street.

252
00:12:07,056 --> 00:12:09,969
The one with the long ponytail,
she wears those blue sweatpants.

253
00:12:10,432 --> 00:12:14,992
The blond with the blue sweatpants.

254
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:16,794
Yeah, I think I've seen her.

255
00:12:18,257 --> 00:12:19,784
Well, I gotta get going.

256
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:22,629
I'm meeting a guy
with grey sweatpants.

257
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:28,797
Wait, wait, wait. How do
you know it's not John Tesh?

258
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,905
- The blond with the blue sweatpants!
- Who is she?

259
00:12:34,062 --> 00:12:36,854
I had a crush on her for a year!
I've been afraid to approach her.

260
00:12:37,015 --> 00:12:38,968
She belongs on one of these
Hallmark cards.

261
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,038
Oh, right! Right!
The blue sweatpants!

262
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:45,525
It's too bad you can't say
anything because of Angela.

263
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:48,709
Yeah.

264
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:51,780
Too bad.

265
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:57,953
Angela.

266
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:00,446
Lousy thug.

267
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:03,973
What kind of sick person
does something like that?

268
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:06,241
The woman belongs in prison!

269
00:13:06,476 --> 00:13:10,228
I mean, I actually owe it to society
to do something about this!

270
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:12,570
I can't sit by and allow this to go on!

271
00:13:12,729 --> 00:13:15,870
- It's a moral issue, is what it is.
- Can't compromise your principles.

272
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:17,446
- How can I live?
- Can't live.

273
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,782
I'm not religious, but I know
where to draw the line.

274
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,696
This country needs
more people like you.

275
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:23,963
Don't sell yourself short,
saying, "God bless you"...

276
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:27,263
...to every Tom, Dick and Harry,
at great personal risk.

277
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:31,290
- I believe strongly in that. You know.
- There should be more people like us.

278
00:13:31,448 --> 00:13:34,285
That's why the world's
in the shape that it's in.

279
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,273
You're telling me.

280
00:13:41,805 --> 00:13:44,172
I just want you to know
I'm gonna do everything I can...

281
00:13:44,337 --> 00:13:46,825
...to make sure the party responsible
is made responsible...

282
00:13:46,984 --> 00:13:48,435
...or something very close to that.

283
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,544
Well, God bless you.

284
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:53,229
Thank you very much.

285
00:13:57,495 --> 00:14:00,975
Oh, my God. I must be crazy.
What have I done?

286
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,594
- Oh, no. What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

287
00:14:03,901 --> 00:14:06,356
I'll tell you what's wrong.
I just committed adultery.

288
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:09,036
You didn't commit adultery. I did.

289
00:14:11,074 --> 00:14:12,493
Oh, yeah.

290
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,331
If I didn't do it with you, I would have
done it with someone else.

291
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,701
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that.
There's a lot of losers out there.

292
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:23,426
Maybe even someone who didn't say,
"God bless you."

293
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:25,227
Well, that's a given.

294
00:14:25,382 --> 00:14:27,913
In three years with Michael,
not one "God bless you."

295
00:14:28,988 --> 00:14:31,093
Must be hell living in that house.

296
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:35,539
- Hi, it's Michael.
- Hi, Michael.

297
00:14:35,701 --> 00:14:38,647
- Is Robin there?
- Robin? No, why?

298
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:41,561
She said she was gonna be with you.

299
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:44,484
No, I haven't spoken to her all da...

300
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:47,548
Yeah, right.

301
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,584
As a... As a matter of fact...

302
00:14:49,741 --> 00:14:53,538
She... She was here and she...
She left a note...

303
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:57,903
...but l... I wasn't here, but l...
I have the note right here.

304
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:00,135
If she's not with you, where is she?

305
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,938
Well, l... I don't know.

306
00:15:02,093 --> 00:15:05,421
Is she with your bald friend
from the other night?

307
00:15:05,814 --> 00:15:07,417
No. No.

308
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:09,913
Come on, Michael.

309
00:15:10,264 --> 00:15:14,137
He's finished. I'm gonna
sew his ass to his face!

310
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,933
I'm gonna twist his neck so hard
his lips will be his eyebrows!

311
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:21,307
I'm gonna break his joints
and reattach them!

312
00:15:22,424 --> 00:15:25,293
You're so good-looking.

313
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:30,512
Now, you listen to me, suck-face!

314
00:15:30,748 --> 00:15:32,548
You tell anybody anything...

315
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:35,693
...and I will carve my initials
in your brain tissue.

316
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,141
- Let me rephrase...
- I'll bash your skull in...

317
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:41,556
...like a bad cabbage,
and I'll have a party on your head!

318
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,697
- Elaine. This is Angela.
- I'll pluck your body hairs out...

319
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,662
...with my teeth!

320
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:49,613
Well, I think I get the gist of it.

321
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:51,989
So you don't say anything
to anybody...

322
00:15:52,153 --> 00:15:54,138
...about me hitting that car.

323
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:55,872
What car?

324
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:57,751
Good.

325
00:15:57,907 --> 00:16:00,896
- I'm glad we understand each other.
- It's not complicated.

326
00:16:05,042 --> 00:16:07,453
Very nice meeting you.

327
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:11,325
Come on up.

328
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:15,782
Well, well, Mr. Seinfeld...

329
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:18,653
...that must have been
so frightening...

330
00:16:18,813 --> 00:16:21,835
...when you confronted
that guy in Queens.

331
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:24,255
Now, let me just see
if I've got the scenario right.

332
00:16:24,414 --> 00:16:26,366
- All right, Elaine.
- No, no, no...

333
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:28,585
...because I'm picturing...
What? What?

334
00:16:28,748 --> 00:16:30,396
French Connection kind of thing.

335
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:33,268
You know, sort of a Popeye Doyle
chase through the city.

336
00:16:33,428 --> 00:16:35,567
- It was just a couple of blocks.
- Oh, no, no.

337
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,562
Come on. Don't be so modest.

338
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,248
- Hey.
- Oh.

339
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,746
Did you check your machine?

340
00:16:42,903 --> 00:16:44,736
No. Why? What's happened?

341
00:16:45,396 --> 00:16:48,004
Michael called me today,
and he asked me where Robin was.

342
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:51,219
- Yeah, okay.
- And I said I hadn't seen her.

343
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:54,250
- What?
- No, George, you don't understand.

344
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:56,745
She didn't tell me
she was using me as an excuse.

345
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,621
Okay? But then I realized
what was going on...

346
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:02,465
...and I said that she left a note.

347
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,683
But he didn't really buy that.

348
00:17:04,845 --> 00:17:07,179
And then... And then
he did mention your name.

349
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,099
He mentioned my name?
What did he say?

350
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:13,351
He said he was gonna...

351
00:17:13,514 --> 00:17:16,809
...sew your ass to your face.

352
00:17:17,657 --> 00:17:19,108
What?

353
00:17:19,268 --> 00:17:22,519
- Why couldn't you think of something?
- I don't know! He caught me off guard!

354
00:17:22,682 --> 00:17:24,667
You lie! How hard is it to lie!

355
00:17:24,831 --> 00:17:26,281
It's not that hard.

356
00:17:28,168 --> 00:17:30,153
Well, who told you
to sleep with her, George?

357
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:32,116
Not my fault.
I wasn't gonna do anything...

358
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:35,567
...until you got her juiced up with your
story about the affair with the matador!

359
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:39,052
None of this would have happened
if you hadn't said, "God bless you"!

360
00:17:39,216 --> 00:17:42,237
- Don't start.
- Hold it, hold it, hold it, people.

361
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,232
- Matador?
- Oh, God.

362
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:45,998
What matador?

363
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:48,068
She told them she had
an affair with a matador.

364
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,528
A matador.

365
00:17:49,688 --> 00:17:51,564
Well, well.

366
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,853
Pray tell, what was
the young man's name?

367
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:05,334
Eduardo Caroccio.

368
00:18:05,722 --> 00:18:08,089
Eduardo...

369
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,621
...Caroccio.

370
00:18:11,016 --> 00:18:14,540
That's good. That's very good.
Kind of just rolls off the tongue.

371
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:18,495
Where on the Upper West Side
might a single girl meet a matador?

372
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,101
- Perhaps, Zabar's.
- No.

373
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:22,716
Or Ray's Pizza.

374
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:28,392
This person told me to tell you
to get an estimate on the damage.

375
00:18:28,546 --> 00:18:32,179
I already got an estimate. It's $875.

376
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:34,329
$875?

377
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:36,172
That's right.

378
00:18:36,947 --> 00:18:38,823
Well, I'll tell you what.

379
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:42,777
I'll give you a check, and then
this person can pay me back.

380
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:45,684
Who do I make it out to?

381
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:49,294
Becky Gelke. G-E-L-K-E.

382
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:52,748
So, what are you doing this weekend?

383
00:18:53,097 --> 00:18:54,591
You have got some nerve.

384
00:18:54,746 --> 00:18:56,776
You smash up my car,
you don't admit it...

385
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:58,351
...and now you want to ask me out?

386
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:01,189
- I didn't do it!
- Yeah, right.

387
00:19:02,572 --> 00:19:04,066
You are so good-looking.

388
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:05,640
Thank you.

389
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,278
Jerry, let's go. You ready?

390
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:13,888
You really want to do this?
I'm on the road for three weeks.

391
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,911
Excuse me, I've got a maniac
stalking me. I'm not staying in the city.

392
00:19:17,877 --> 00:19:20,441
- All right.
- Come on, let's get out of here.

393
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,937
How could you?

394
00:19:24,092 --> 00:19:26,623
- What?
- I never thought you were capable.

395
00:19:26,777 --> 00:19:28,882
- What did I do?
- I talked to Becky Gelke outside.

396
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,262
She told me you hit and ran.

397
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,562
I don't even want to
look at you anymore!

398
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,939
All these years of friendship, and
you're... You're nothing but a felon!

399
00:19:37,096 --> 00:19:39,081
You're an embarrassment
to the building.

400
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:43,073
I didn't do it. I just had to pay her
to cover for somebody else.

401
00:19:43,502 --> 00:19:46,033
- You're not gonna lie to me, are you?
- No. Never.

402
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:48,598
All right. I'm glad we got that
straightened out...

403
00:19:48,757 --> 00:19:50,590
...because I got a date with her.

404
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,853
You got a date with Becky Gelke?

405
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,492
- I'm going out with her Saturday.
- Can we get out of here?

406
00:19:57,657 --> 00:20:00,723
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have
had an excuse to talk to her.

407
00:20:00,879 --> 00:20:04,436
Well, I'm happy to help
in any way that I can.

408
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:16,098
Liz Taylor...

409
00:20:21,018 --> 00:20:24,771
A man is paralysed, mentally,
by a beautiful woman.

410
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:26,611
Advertisers really
take advantage of this.

411
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:29,227
Don't you love ads where
you see the woman in the bikini...

412
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,836
...next to the 32-piece ratchet set,
you know, and she's...?

413
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:33,669
We'll be looking at the girl...

414
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,118
...looking at the ratchet set going, "All
right, if she's next to the ratchet set...

415
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:41,996
...and I had that ratchet set...

416
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:45,253
...I wonder if that
would mean that...

417
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:50,976
I better just buy that ratchet set."

418
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,159
