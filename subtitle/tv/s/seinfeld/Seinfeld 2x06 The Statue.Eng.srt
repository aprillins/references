1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,598
I have to tell you that I did get
some very exciting news recently.

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,430
I don't know if I should tell you
what it is, because it's not definite yet.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,636
- Come on!
- Come on!

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,360
Well, I will tell you
what I do know so far.

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,513
According to the information that
I have in the envelope that I received...

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,557
...it seems...

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,991
...that I may have already won
some very valuable prizes.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,232
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,709
Well, thank you.
It's very nice to hear that.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,269
But in all honesty...

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,274
...I have to say, I didn't even know
I was in this thing.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,671
But according to the readout...

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,674
...it looks like I am among the top
people that they are considering.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,398
That annoys me about sweepstakes.

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,630
They tease you with,
"You may have already won."

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,268
I'd like once for a sweepstakes
company to have some guts.

17
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,795
Just tell people the truth one time.
Send out envelopes:

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,594
"You have definitely lost."

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,073
You turn it over, giant printing:

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,435
" Not even close."

21
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,556
You open it,
there's a letter of explanation:

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,757
" Even we cannot believe how badly
you've done in this contest."

23
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,471
To the right.

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,754
Boy, that took a while.

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,277
- Don't get up.
- I'd like to help, but my neck...

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,596
So how long has it been
in the basement?

27
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,074
Since my grandfather died.

28
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,118
I was supposed to send it
to my parents, but they didn't want it.

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,111
They said get rid of it,
but I felt funny.

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,238
And then I forgot about it.
It's been sitting there for three years...

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,152
...until he saw it.

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,517
All right, so just take what you want,
and let's get it out of here.

33
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,949
What's in it?

34
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,111
Grandpa clothes. I can't wear them.

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,318
You want these? Knee socks.
You don't wear knee socks.

36
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,477
No. Go ahead.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,195
Look at this place.
I can't wait to get it cleaned.

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,993
I know somebody who'll do it.

39
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,434
She's good, she's honest...

40
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,918
No, Elaine's got this writer friend
from Finland. Rava.

41
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,469
Her boyfriend goes to
Columbia grad school.

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,834
And he's supposed to do it.

43
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,432
Students can't clean. It's anathema.

44
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,473
They don't like it.

45
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,759
How long you been waiting to squeeze
that into a conversation?

46
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,153
Now, this, I like.

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,118
Wait a second.

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,989
I can't believe this.

49
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,188
- Let me see this.
- Wait, wait.

50
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,591
- Let me just see it for a second.
- No. Come on, come on.

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,313
- Oh, my God. It's exactly the same.
- What?

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,513
When I was 1 0 years old, my parents
had this very same statue...

53
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,875
...on the mantel
of our apartment. Exactly.

54
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,237
And one day I grabbed it,
I was using it as a microphone.

55
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,391
I was singing " MacArthur Park."

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,358
And I got to the part about,
" I'll never have the recipe again"...

57
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,431
...and it slipped out my hand,
and it broke.

58
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,910
My parents looked at me like
I smashed the Ten Commandments.

59
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,911
To this day, they bring it up.

60
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,878
It was the single most damaging
experience of my life.

61
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,759
Aside from seeing my father naked.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,798
- Come on, I saw it first.
- Kramer, I have to have the statue.

63
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,315
- I got dibs.
- No dibs. I need the statue. Give it!

64
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,232
Spread out.

65
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,914
You numbskulls.

66
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,599
Why don't you just settle it
like mature adults?

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,991
- Potato man.
- No, no.

68
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,113
No potato man. Inka-dink.

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,279
Okay.

70
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,352
- Yeah, start with me.
- Yeah. Good, good.

71
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,038
Inka-dink, a bottle of ink
The cork fell out, and you stink

72
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,350
Not because you're dirty
Not because you're clean

73
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,876
Just because you kissed a girl
Behind the magazine

74
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,073
- And you are...
- Wait a minute. No.

75
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,673
...it
- What? What are you doing?

76
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,713
No, no. Oh, okay. All right.
He's out, I get it.

77
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,348
- No, no, no. I'm it. I win.
- No.

78
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,317
He's it. He wins.

79
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,674
It is good.

80
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,159
Do over. Start with him.

81
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,594
No, no.

82
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,035
Come on, Kramer.
Now, you got the socks.

83
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,589
All right, you can have it.

84
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,713
Okay. I'm gonna take the suit...

85
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,348
...and shoes...

86
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,112
...and the hat.
- All right. Let's go.

87
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,670
Hey, I look like Joe Friday
in Dragnet.

88
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,479
I can't believe I won at inka-dink.

89
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,038
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,200
- Aren't you gonna take it?
- I don't wanna carry it around.

91
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,554
I'll pick it up later.

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,551
What about your stuff?

93
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,914
Okay.

94
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,918
All right, let's go. Hey...
You know, you owe me one.

95
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,674
- What?
- The inka-dink. You were it.

96
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,912
- It's bad?
- It's very bad.

97
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,391
If they don't let you be
my editor on this...

98
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,120
...I go to another publisher.
It's that simple.

99
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,437
- You told them that?
- Of course.

100
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,876
Oh, this is so fantastic.
I don't know how to thank you.

101
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,511
Where's this boyfriend of yours?
I can't wait much longer, I got a flight.

102
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,079
He's probably caught in traffic.

103
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,878
Or maybe he's dead.

104
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,471
So, what do you write,
children's books?

105
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,191
That's Ray.

106
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,948
Greetings. Greetings and salutations.

107
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,429
I beg your forgiveness.
My tardiness was unavoidable.

108
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,751
Rava, my love.

109
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,559
Elaine, dear friend.

110
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,678
And you must be Jerry,
lord of the manor.

111
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,751
My liege. A pleasure to serve you.

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,149
All right.

113
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,996
Well, we have to get back to work.

114
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,914
I gotta get to the airport.

115
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,509
Your palace shall sparkle
like the stars in heaven...

116
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,113
...upon your safe arrival, sire.

117
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,393
The toilet brush is under the sink.

118
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,356
I don't feel comfortable
with a maid either.

119
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,875
There's that guilt when someone's
cleaning your house.

120
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,429
You're sitting on the sofa,
they go by with the vacuum.

121
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,716
" I'm really sorry about this.

122
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,996
I don't know why I left
that stuff over there."

123
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,512
That's why I could never be a maid.
I would have that attitude.

124
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,559
I'd find them, wherever they are.
" I suppose you couldn't do this.

125
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,034
No, don't get up.
Let me clean up your filth.

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,072
No, you couldn't dust.
Oh, this is too tough, isn't it?"

127
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,318
He really did an amazing job. Look.

128
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,278
He uncoagulated
the top of the dishwashing liquid.

129
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,309
He cleaned out the bottom
of the little egg cups.

130
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,879
Come here, look at this.

131
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,355
He cleaned in the little one-inch area...

132
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,239
...between the refrigerator
and the counter.

133
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,595
How'd he get in there?

134
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,870
He must be like Rubber Man.

135
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,274
There's no Rubber Man.

136
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,475
Why did I think there was
a Rubber Man?

137
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,830
There's Elastic Man, Plastic Man...

138
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,358
- I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

139
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,317
To Rava's. I gotta
pick up her manuscript.

140
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,040
- Oh, wait, I'll go with you.
- Okay.

141
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,748
Elaine, he Windexed
the little peephole.

142
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,630
So the meeting with Lippman
is all set.

143
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,518
He's the editor in chief.

144
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,240
- I think because of your request.
- Demand.

145
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,110
They're gonna promote me to editor.

146
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,157
Darn tooting.

147
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,751
There's Ray, late as usual.

148
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,913
Well.

149
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,992
This is an unexpected surprise.
And delight.

150
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,515
The once and future king of comedy,
Jerry the first...

151
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,908
...gracing our humble abode.

152
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,556
Rava, we are in the presence
of royalty.

153
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,948
Hey, Ray, listen.

154
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,554
You really did a tremendous job
cleaning that apartment.

155
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,517
But I didn't just clean
your apartment.

156
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,750
It was a ritual, a ceremony.

157
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,399
A celebration of life.

158
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,834
Shouldn't you be
out on a ledge somewhere?

159
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,874
He's funny.

160
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,076
- Water's boiling. Are we having tea?
- Yes.

161
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,276
Yes. Jerry?

162
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,713
- Jerry.
- What?

163
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,440
Ray, would you give me
a hand, please?

164
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,355
Yeah, I'm coming.

165
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,269
I think that's the statue
from my house.

166
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,431
That looks like the statue
from my house.

167
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,869
- What statue?
- I had a statue.

168
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,393
You do? I never saw a statue.

169
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,152
My grandfather gave me a statue.

170
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,629
- Since when?
- What's the difference? That's the one.

171
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,109
He ripped me off.
This guy ripped me off.

172
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,788
Do you take sugar?

173
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,951
- No.
- No.

174
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,952
I can't believe it.
This guy ripped me off.

175
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,112
- Do you realize what you're saying?
- Yes, this guy ripped me off.

176
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,111
He stole that statue
right out of my house.

177
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,157
Lemon?

178
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,356
- Sure.
- Yeah.

179
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,437
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

180
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,715
- 99-percent sure.
- 99-percent sure?

181
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,908
Sweet elixir, its fragrant nectar
a soothing balm for the soul.

182
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,311
Those are the pastries.
Take care of that.

183
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,391
I'm gonna get Elaine the manuscript.

184
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,551
The pastries.

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,116
Maybe it just looks the same.
It's a coincidence.

186
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,999
Coincidence? This guy's in
my apartment, and by coincidence...

187
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,310
...he has the exact same statue
in his apartment?

188
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,552
- I never saw any statue.
- I had a statue.

189
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,871
What should I do?

190
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,951
I'll call Kramer.
He can check my house.

191
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,758
Oh, Jerry.

192
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,674
- Don't blow this for me.
- Don't worry.

193
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,069
Kramer.

194
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,754
It's Jerry. Jerry.

195
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,037
From next door.
Never mind where I am.

196
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,270
Yes, Jerry Seinfeld.

197
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,112
Ma, I told you...

198
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,999
...just dip the bread in the batter...

199
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,151
...and put it in the pan.

200
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,313
Okay, bye. My mother.

201
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,358
She forgot how to make
French toast.

202
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,669
You know how mothers are.

203
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,350
My mother left us
when I was 6 years old.

204
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,715
All seven of us.
We never heard from her again.

205
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,950
I hope she's rotting
in an alley somewhere.

206
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,668
My mom's down in Florida.

207
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,673
She's got one of those condos.

208
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,513
Hot down there in the summer.
You ever been down there?

209
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,838
I love these pastries.

210
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,912
In Scandinavian mythology,
the pastries were the food of the gods.

211
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,193
Listen, I just remembered, I'm...

212
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,634
...getting a facial.

213
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,519
Oh, I'll see you tomorrow morning.

214
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,757
- How about dinner?
- No, I don't eat dinner.

215
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,036
Dinner's for suckers.

216
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,039
Yeah, okay.

217
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,952
Thanks anyway. Bye.

218
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,554
Nope.

219
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,757
Cop says it's my word against his.
There's nothing they can do.

220
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,474
Let's go get him.

221
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,915
- Yeah, right.
- We can't let him get away with this.

222
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,150
You realize how crazy
he had to be to do this?

223
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,120
He knew I was gonna know
it's missing and that he took it.

224
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,599
And of all things to take.

225
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,672
I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo.
He's crazy.

226
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,599
You wanna go get him?

227
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,151
If he's crazy,
you should just forget it.

228
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,554
Forget it?

229
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,676
I already called my parents.

230
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,149
I told them to expect
the surprise of a lifetime.

231
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,709
My mother's making
her roasted potatoes.

232
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,996
George, do you realize...

233
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,391
...that Rava has asked me
to edit her book?

234
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,993
Who is this Rava?

235
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,072
I say we get him.

236
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,357
- Let me just call him.
- I'll call him.

237
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,389
Hello, Ray?

238
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,711
Hi, Ray. This is Rava's friend,
Elaine's friend, Jerry.

239
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,677
Yeah, the king of comedy, right.

240
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,718
Listen, you know that statue
on your mantel...

241
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,714
...the one with...? The blue lady?
Would you shut up?!

242
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,798
Yeah. Oh, you don't want to talk
about it over the phone.

243
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,275
You don't want Rava to hear.

244
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,953
Yeah, I understand.

245
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,076
You know the coffee shop
near my house, Monk's?

246
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,354
All right, tomorrow, 1:00.

247
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,794
Great. Okay, bye.

248
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,838
All right, look. Look, look.

249
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,434
- Let's say he stole it.
- Oh, he stole it.

250
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,673
You can't do anything about it.

251
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,432
The cops won't do anything.

252
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,718
What, are you gonna go fight him?
Why don't you just forget it.

253
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,113
- No.
- No.

254
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,228
Thought you said 1:00.

255
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,517
Relax. He's late. He's always late.
It's part of his m.o.

256
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,353
Remember, don't take any crap.

257
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,238
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.

258
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,118
- I'll be right here.
- That's comforting.

259
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,276
He's coming.

260
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,799
Ray.

261
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,632
Jerry.

262
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,840
I can't believe you asked me
about that statue.

263
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,195
You know how much trouble
you could've gotten me in?

264
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,920
- Well, l...
- Rava was standing right next to me.

265
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,036
I never told her
where I got the statue.

266
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,270
- I wonder why.
- Well, just give it back...

267
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,714
...and I won't say anything.

268
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,428
- Give it back?
- Yeah.

269
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,875
- What are you talking about?
- What's he talking about?

270
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,996
- I'm talking about the statue.
- Yeah, me too.

271
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,958
- Give it back to whom?
- Me.

272
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,754
- You?
- Yeah, me.

273
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,310
- I'm not getting this.
- You already got it.

274
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,916
Ray, I had a statue in my house.

275
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,559
You were in my house.

276
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,438
And then I saw it in your house.

277
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,751
- What are you saying?
- What am I saying?

278
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,831
Take a wild guess.

279
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,551
Are you saying I stole your statue?

280
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,950
- What a mind.
- Well, l...

281
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,635
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.

282
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,473
For your information,
I got that statue in a pawnshop.

283
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,193
- Pawnshop?
- A pawnshop?

284
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,828
In Chinatown, with money I earned
cleaning apartments.

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,389
- Cleaning them out.
- Oh, excuse me.

286
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,595
Yeah.

287
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,152
Look, Ray, you were the only person
in my house.

288
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,074
What's behind this?
It's Rava, isn't it?

289
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,434
Again with the Rava.

290
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,672
- You want her.
- No, she's a little too cheery for me.

291
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,912
She's from Finland, for crying out
loud. Finland! Do you understand?

292
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,513
I know Finland. They're neutral.

293
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,240
Is it me?
Do I rub you the wrong way?

294
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,437
No, actually, I find you quite charming.
A bit verbose at times.

295
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,433
" I find you so charming." You wuss.

296
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,950
- Did you call me a wuss?
- What did you say?

297
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,554
I said, " luss."

298
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,029
I'm at a " luss."

299
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,430
I'd love to take you to the pawnshop
where I got it.

300
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,953
That's not necessary.

301
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,515
You know, maybe it's not
that bad an idea.

302
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,394
And I would love to.
Nothing would please me more.

303
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,994
But unfortunately, the guy retired
and moved to Singapore.

304
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,752
Singapore? Do you hear this?

305
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,798
If you really want, maybe I can
contact the guy in Singapore.

306
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,076
Have him make a Photostat
of the receipt...

307
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,071
...and send it over.
- That's it.

308
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,470
That's it! I can't take it.
I can't take it anymore!

309
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,074
You stole the statue!
You're a thief! You're a liar!

310
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,195
- George.
- Who is this?

311
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,875
I'm the judge and the jury, pal.
And the verdict is, guilty!

312
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,473
- What is going on here?
- Guilty!

313
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,392
- Your friend is crazy.
- Oh, I'm crazy!

314
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,120
- George, George.
- I've gotta get going. I have a class.

315
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,919
Oh, a class, huh? A class.
At Columbia?

316
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,719
Let me tell you something.
I called the registrar's office.

317
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,836
I checked you out.
They have no record...

318
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,195
...of a Ray Thomas at that school,
you liar!

319
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,079
That is because I am registered
under my full legal name...

320
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,673
...Raymond Thomas Wochinski.

321
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,513
Ray Thomas is
my professional name.

322
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,874
You mean "alias."

323
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,912
You are starting to make me angry.

324
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,079
Well...

325
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,271
...that was bound to happen.

326
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,312
I hope you think about
what you've done here today.

327
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,835
And if you wanna call
and apologize...

328
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,274
...you know where to reach me.

329
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,829
- Hey, Ray.
- Yes?

330
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,556
How did you get the goop out of
the top of the dishwashing liquid?

331
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,995
It was like a brand-new nozzle.

332
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,675
- Nervous?
- Why should I be?

333
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,068
Yeah. Right.

334
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,718
Your notes were very insightful.

335
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,595
The book is great.

336
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,954
Did you go out last night?

337
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,954
No, we made love on the floor
like two animals.

338
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,199
Ray is insatiable.

339
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,073
They all are.

340
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,993
Was Jerry?

341
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,871
I can't remember.

342
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,430
You know, Ray is very upset
over these accusations.

343
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,356
I'm staying out of this one.
This is between them.

344
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,112
I am not getting involved.

345
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,914
So you think he stole it?

346
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,469
You have to admit,
the circumstantial evidence...

347
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,073
I admit nothing.

348
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,831
Will you put that cigarette out,
please?

349
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,798
I mean, he was in the apartment...

350
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,076
...and then it's gone,
and it's in your apartment.

351
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,231
- Maybe you think we're in cahoots.
- No.

352
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,799
But it's quite a coincidence.

353
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,235
Yes, that's all, a coincidence.

354
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,434
Big coincidence.

355
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,875
Not a big coincidence.
A coincidence.

356
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,314
No, that's a big coincidence.

357
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,754
That's what a coincidence is.

358
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,480
There are no small coincidences
and big coincidences.

359
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,631
No. There are degrees
of coincidences.

360
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,109
No. There are only coincidences.
Ask anyone.

361
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,555
Are there big coincidences
and small coincidences...

362
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,358
...or just coincidences?

363
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,829
Well?

364
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,951
Will you put that cigarette out?

365
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,315
Maybe I put it out on your face.

366
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,118
It's just like Ray said.

367
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,193
You and Jerry, you're jealous
of our love. You're trying to destroy us.

368
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,837
Shouldn't you be
out on a ledge somewhere?

369
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,190
Ma, will you stop?

370
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,080
It's just a statue.

371
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,870
How is it my fault? It was stolen.
I didn't even touch it this time.

372
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,110
Okay, fine.

373
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,350
I don't see why this should affect
the potatoes.

374
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,597
Okay! Goodbye.

375
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,070
She doesn't react to disappointment
very well.

376
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,434
Unlike me.

377
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,432
I'm not happy about this.

378
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,391
Why don't we just throw a
Molotov cocktail through their window.

379
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,198
There's just no justice.

380
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,112
This experience has changed me.

381
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,840
It's made me more cynical,
more bitter, more jaded.

382
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,588
- Really?
- Sure. Why not?

383
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,588
How do you think I feel?

384
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:32,639
Instead of editing the first novel
of a major young writing talent...

385
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,998
...I am proofreading
a food-allergy cookbook.

386
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,476
- Can't you talk to your boss?
- I did.

387
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,959
He loves Rava.

388
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,439
Worse, he loves Ray.

389
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,318
And he doesn't think
you're funny at all.

390
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,230
I'm not happy about this.

391
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,595
Perhaps we can take comfort
in the knowledge...

392
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,558
...that in the next world,
Ray will be the recipient...

393
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,029
...of a much larger and more harsh
brand of justice.

394
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,958
Yeah, he'll have my parents.

395
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,356
Police. Open up!

396
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,798
Police?

397
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,434
- Freeze, mama!
- Hey, hey...

398
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,591
Shut up! Spread them.

399
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,193
I said, spread them!

400
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,588
You're in big trouble, son.

401
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,159
Burglary, grand larceny...

402
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,753
...possession of stolen goods.

403
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,319
- And murder!
- Murder?

404
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,277
Shut up! Keep them spread.

405
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,079
You just make love
to that wall, pervert.

406
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,753
Hey, I think you have me confused
with somebody else.

407
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,674
- Is your name Ray?
- Yeah.

408
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,115
Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for!

409
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,438
Hey. Hey, are you a cop?

410
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,990
Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop.
I'm a damn good cop!

411
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,917
And today's your lucky day, junior.

412
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,275
Because I'm gonna let you off
with just a warning.

413
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,557
Any more of this criminal activity,
and you'll be sorry. You got me?

414
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,438
I don't know
what you're talking about.

415
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,392
Good, good. Let's keep it that way.

416
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,438
All right, all right.
What's the big hubbub, bub?

417
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,154
Kramer, I can't believe it.

418
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,356
- Oh, you're my hero!
- Yeah.

419
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,875
- Kramer, what did you do?
- Well, let's put it this way:

420
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,634
I didn't take him to People's Court.

421
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,229
I feel like a huge weight has been
lifted off my shoulders.

422
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,153
l... I feel happy!

423
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,912
Kramer, I don't know
how to thank you.

424
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,991
Well, I'll think of something.

425
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,154
People are going to steal from you.
You can't stop them.

426
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,914
But everybody has their own little
personal security things.

427
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,437
Things that they think will foil the
crooks, you know, in your mind.

428
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,558
You go to the beach, go in the water.
Put your wallet in the sneaker.

429
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,517
Who's gonna know?

430
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,191
What criminal mind could penetrate
this fortress of security?

431
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,511
" I tied a bow.

432
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,148
They can't get through that."

433
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,915
" I put the wallet down
by the toe of the sneaker.

434
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,158
They never look there.
They check the heel, they move on."

435
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,671
