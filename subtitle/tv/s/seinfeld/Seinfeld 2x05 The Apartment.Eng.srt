1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,478
Well, I painted my apartment again.
I've been living there for years.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,312
Every time I paint it,
it gets me down.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,597
I look around and I think,
"Well, it's a little bit smaller now."

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,828
It's the thickness of the paint,
but I'm aware of it.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,672
It just keeps coming in
and coming in.

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,910
Every time I paint it,
it's closer and closer.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,072
I don't know where
the wall outlets are.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,800
I just look for a lump
with two slots in it.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,589
Looks like a pig is trying to push
his way through from the other side.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,909
That's where I plug in.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,871
My idea of the perfect living room...

12
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,713
...would be the bridge
on the starship Enterprise.

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,555
You know what I mean?
Big chair, nice screen, remote control.

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,473
That's why Star Trek really
was the ultimate male fantasy.

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,838
Just hurtling through space
in your living room watching TV.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,878
The aliens were always dropping in...

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,554
...because Kirk was the only one
that had the big screen.

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,473
They'd come over Friday nights.
Klingon boxing. Got to be there.

19
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,032
- What did you do?
- Mousse. I moussed up.

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,237
- I guess it was just a matter of time.
- I should've done this years ago.

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,197
I mean, I feel like I've had two lives.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,352
My pre-mousse,
and now I begin my post-mousse.

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,432
Tell me the truth, have you ever seen
a better-looking guy?

24
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,273
Looks is so subjective.

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,149
I don't mean to interrupt or anything...

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,517
...but on Sunday, my friend is having
a brunch for the New York Marathon...

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,036
Oh, God... I keep forgetting
to enter that.

28
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,678
She lives right above First Avenue,
has a perfect view of the race.

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,308
- She said I could invite some friends.
- Maybe.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,833
No! I'm not going up there!

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,314
Harold and Manny.

32
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,436
Boys, boys.

33
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,079
Oh, Jerry.

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,198
I slid the rent under your door,
Harold. Did you get it?

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,717
Hey, Jerry. Would you like anything
from Ms. Hudwalker's apartment?

36
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,639
I was only joking.

37
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,155
He thinks I'm gonna give you
Ms. Hudwalker's things.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,911
We have to go up now
and clean the apartment.

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,556
It's a good thing her rent was overdue.
She'd be rotting there for a month.

40
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,392
She died? Mrs. Hudwalker died?

41
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,472
Ninety-four years old.
I found her yesterday.

42
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,235
She didn't have her wig on.
It was horrifying.

43
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,758
What's the matter with you?
I'm talking!

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,956
So you know anybody
who needs an apartment?

45
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,712
You know my friend Elaine?

46
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,879
Oh, yeah. I like her.
She always says hello.

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,315
It's not promised to anyone?
She'd take it in a second.

48
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,950
Well, Manny wanted it for his brother,
but he got deported.

49
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,551
- What's the difference? It's true.
- So it's okay? She can have it?

50
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,679
Sure. She's getting a bargain too.
It's only $400 a month.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,513
Okay.

52
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,077
- Okay.
- Hey, Harold. What do you think?

53
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,234
Manny, look.
Kramer put mousse in his hair.

54
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,632
Thanks.

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,830
What was that all about?

56
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,309
Oh, nothing important.

57
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,669
What's going on? What is that look?

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,031
What look?

59
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,633
Nothing.

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,076
Something's going on here.

61
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,435
I don't know if you should sit for this
or not.

62
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,472
Sitting is good if you faint...

63
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,839
...but standing is good
for jumping up and down.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,719
- I can't decide.
- Jumping up and down?

65
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,269
What are you talking about?
Come on, cough it up.

66
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,398
Oh, Elaine,
you know the way I am...

67
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,632
...rarely ever thinking of myself.

68
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,755
My only concern is the welfare
and happiness of those close to me.

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,509
Sure, it hurts sometimes
to give and give and give...

70
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,908
Would you please?

71
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,755
What would you say
if I told you that...?

72
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,918
Told me what?

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,356
I got you an apartment
in this building.

74
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,874
- No!
- Yes.

75
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,235
- No! You didn't!
- Yes. I did.

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,630
You got me an apartment
in the building?

77
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,677
I got you an apartment
in the building.

78
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,558
- How did you...?
- Remember Mrs. Hudwalker?

79
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,676
The 94-year-old woman
who lived above me.

80
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,599
- No.
- She died.

81
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,239
- She died?
- She died.

82
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,674
- She died!
- Yeah.

83
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,837
- And the rent is only $400 a month.
- Get out!

84
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,318
Four hundred a month?
Only 400 a month?

85
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,471
- Four hundred a month.
- I'd be right upstairs?

86
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,153
- Right upstairs.
- Right above you?

87
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,197
Right above me.

88
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,273
We're neighbours.
I'll be here all the time!

89
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,716
All the time.

90
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,514
We can exchange keys
so we can come in and out.

91
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,194
Oh, this is gonna be great.

92
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,711
All the time.

93
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,789
The problem with talking is nobody
stops you from saying the wrong thing.

94
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,791
I think life would be a lot better...

95
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,030
...if it was like you're
always making a movie.

96
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,875
You mess up, somebody just walks
on the set and stops the whole shot.

97
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,914
Think of the things
you wish you could take back.

98
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,198
You're out somewhere with people.
"Gee, you look pregnant. Are you?"

99
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,635
" Cut, cut, cut!

100
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,950
That's not gonna work at all.

101
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,396
Walk out the door. Come back in.
Let's take this whole scene again.

102
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,994
People, think about
what you're saying."

103
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,954
Thanks. See you later, Donna.

104
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,436
- What happened?
- You can't believe what I did.

105
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,272
- What did you do?
- I could tell you...

106
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,795
...but you won't believe it.
It's not believable.

107
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,871
- How could I have done that?
- Done what?

108
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,508
I told Elaine about an apartment
opening up in my building.

109
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,433
- She's going to move in.
- Elaine's moving into your building?

110
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,831
- Yes. Right above me.
- Right above you?

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,230
- You're gonna be neighbours.
- I know. Neighbours.

112
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,436
- She's right above you?
- Right above me.

113
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,716
- How could you do that?
- Because I'm an idiot.

114
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,916
You think you're an idiot,
but with all due respect...

115
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,036
...l'm a much bigger idiot
than you are.

116
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,839
Don't insult me, my friend.
Remember who you're talking to.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,513
No one's a bigger idiot than me.

118
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,750
Ever ask an ex-girlfriend
to move into your building?

119
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,912
Ever go to a singles' weekend
in the Poconos?

120
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,634
She's right in my building.
Right above me.

121
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,712
Every time I come in, I'll have
to sneak around like a cat burglar.

122
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,633
You're doomed. You'll have
all your sex at women's apartments.

123
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,110
It'll be a permanent road trip. Forget
about the home-bed advantage.

124
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,239
- But I need the home-bed advantage.
- Of course. We all do.

125
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,836
- Come in for two minutes. Sit with me.
- I was just in there. It's embarrassing.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,036
Oh, who's gonna know?

127
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,715
- They all saw me walk out.
- Two minutes.

128
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,111
My censoring system broke down.

129
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,716
You know that little guy in your head
who watches everything you say?

130
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,953
He went for a cup of coffee.
And, in that second, ruined my life.

131
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,032
My censor quit two years ago.

132
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,431
Checked into a clinic,
emotionally exhausted.

133
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,075
So is there any way out
of this Elaine thing?

134
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,229
Tough.

135
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,392
Water pressure's terrible in my
building. She loves a good shower.

136
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,632
Never heard of anyone turning down an
apartment because of weak showers.

137
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,711
If they were fanatic about showers,
they might.

138
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,236
For that rent, she'd take a bath
in the toilet tank if she had to.

139
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,077
Look at this woman
feeding her baby...

140
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,789
...greasy, disgusting,
coffee-shop corned beef hash.

141
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,791
Isn't that child abuse?

142
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,394
I'd like to have a kid.

143
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,749
Of course, you have
to have a date first.

144
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,872
Remember my friend Adam
from Detroit?

145
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,600
- Yeah, the guy with the flat head.
- He's a cube.

146
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,637
Anyway, he got married
about six months ago.

147
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,472
Ever since he's worn
a wedding band...

148
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,710
...women have been coming on
to him everywhere.

149
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,270
- I've heard that about wedding bands.
- I wonder if that's really true.

150
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,356
That'd be an interesting
sociological experiment.

151
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,239
You know, Kramer has his father's
band. He'd loan it to you.

152
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,675
Hey, thanks a lot.
I'll give it back in a week.

153
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,115
I don't know why you're fooling around
with this ring.

154
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,919
I've been telling you,
get yourself some plugs...

155
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,593
...or a piece.
- I'm not doing that.

156
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,355
Oh, man. You know, you're crazy.
You're a good-looking guy.

157
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,431
What do you want to walk around
like that for?

158
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,877
No, I'll put a half a can of mousse
in my head like you.

159
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,236
I told you I don't like these sponges.
They're too small.

160
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,038
I want a big sponge!

161
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,790
You can't pick up anything.
There's no absorption.

162
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,549
Boys, boys.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,513
Hi, Jerry.

164
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,557
Hello, Jerry.

165
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,154
Okay.

166
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,269
Okay.

167
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,311
Your friend can't have
the apartment, Jerry.

168
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,199
- What?
- Because somebody offered Manny...

169
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,954
...$5000 for the apartment.

170
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,270
I don't want to do it.
Manny wants to do it.

171
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,111
Because it's true.
Why shouldn't I tell him?

172
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,033
Hey, hey, I understand.
You're businessmen.

173
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,428
Okay, okay.

174
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,915
Now he says that if your friend
has $5000, we'll give it to her.

175
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,229
That's a lot of money...

176
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,154
...but if that's the way it's gotta be,
that's the way it's gotta be.

177
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,876
You know, I used to think
that the universe...

178
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,794
...is a random, chaotic sequence
of meaningless events.

179
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,190
But I see now that there is reason
and purpose to all things.

180
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,873
What happened to you?

181
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,510
Religion, my friend.
That's what happened to me.

182
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,877
Because I have just been informed
that it's going to cost Elaine...

183
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,079
...the sum of $5000
to get the apartment upstairs.

184
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,550
Five thousand dollars?
She doesn't have $5000.

185
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,234
- Of course she doesn't.
- So she can't get the apartment.

186
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,879
- Can't get it.
- She doesn't move in.

187
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,519
No move.

188
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,319
So you see?
It's all part of a divine plan.

189
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,151
And how does the baldness
fit into that plan?

190
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,390
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

191
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,193
All right.

192
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,234
This is gonna require
some great acting now.

193
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,118
I have to pretend I'm disappointed.

194
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,677
So you'll see me really being a phoney.
I hope you can take this.

195
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,273
You should go in the other room.

196
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,635
Are you kidding?
I lie every second of the day.

197
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,075
My whole life is a sham.

198
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,871
- Because I love Elaine.
- Of course you do.

199
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,271
But, you know, not in the building.

200
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,796
Really, I feel terrible about this.
My intentions were good.

201
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,518
What can I do? Tell me.

202
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,752
No. I'll be seeing you.

203
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:44,036
Have you ever gotten up in the morning
and felt that it's great to be alive?

204
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,035
That every breath is a gift
of sweet life from above.

205
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,872
Before I forget...

206
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,875
...I have the checks for the first month,
last month, security deposit.

207
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,628
I have $7 5 left in my account.

208
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,874
Well, there's a little bit of a problem.

209
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,917
Oh, I know.
There's a weak shower spray.

210
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,072
I've already thought about it.
I am switching to baths.

211
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,312
Winston Churchill said,
"Why stand when you can sit?"

212
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,357
Maybe I'll get some rubber duckies.

213
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,277
No. Someone offered Harold
and Manny 5000 for the apartment.

214
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,237
They'd just as soon give it to you...

215
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,198
...but you would have to come up
with that money.

216
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,034
Five thousand dollars?

217
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,959
- I don't have $5000.
- I know.

218
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,676
How am I gonna get $5000?

219
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,910
I have no idea.

220
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,796
Hey! My new neighbour.

221
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,112
I'm not moving in.

222
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,238
- What?
- They want $5000 now.

223
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,598
So okay, what's the problem?

224
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,751
I don't have $5000.

225
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,753
Oh, come on!
You can come up with $5000.

226
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,230
Jerry, you don't have $5000
you can lend her?

227
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,753
Come on.

228
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,636
Yeah, well, I didn't... I mean...

229
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,631
Is that something
you want to borrow?

230
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,998
No, that's too much money
to borrow.

231
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,390
Loan her the money.
You can afford it.

232
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,676
She doesn't want
to borrow the money.

233
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,674
Oh, come on. She'll pay you back.
What's 5 grand between friends?

234
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,592
- Of course I'd pay you back.
- Yeah.

235
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,751
So, what's the problem?

236
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,876
- Who said there's a problem?
- See?

237
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,474
- He said he'd loan you the money.
- Well, now, Jerry...

238
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,995
...it might take a while
for me to pay you back.

239
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,355
Maybe a few years.
How do you feel about that?

240
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,478
It's okay. He doesn't care.

241
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,152
You know, money can sometimes
come between friends.

242
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,709
- Get out of here.
- Well, let me think about it.

243
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,919
- What's there to think about?
- I don't know. Five thousand?

244
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,116
Let me just take one more look at it.

245
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,273
It was all over.

246
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,237
Taken care of. Done. Finished.

247
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,915
Five thousand. Where was she gonna
get 5000? She doesn't have 5000.

248
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,150
Clean. Goodbye. She's gone.

249
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,716
Then you come in.
"Why don't you loan her 5000?

250
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,714
What do you care? You got 5000.
Give her 5000!"

251
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,031
- You didn't want her in the building?
- No, I didn't.

252
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,909
Then what did you loan her
the $5000 for?

253
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,151
Well, look, maybe she won't take it.

254
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,198
She did say that she was
gonna think about it.

255
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,955
People don't turn down money. It's
what separates us from the animals.

256
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,749
Yeah, well, I don't understand what the
problem is having her in the building.

257
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,431
Let me explain something to you.

258
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,512
You see...

259
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,913
...you're not normal.

260
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,396
You're a great guy. I love you,
but you're a pod.

261
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,597
l, on the other hand,
am a human being.

262
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,990
I sometimes feel awkward,
uncomfortable...

263
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,914
...even inhibited in certain situations
with the other human beings.

264
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,913
- You wouldn't understand.
- Yeah. Because I'm a pod.

265
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,717
I'll take it!

266
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,273
No.

267
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,636
- Hi, Elaine.
- Oh, hi, Roxanne.

268
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,472
Nice to be here.
These are my friends.

269
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,789
This is George.

270
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,279
- And this is Jerry.
- Hi.

271
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,590
Jerry's the one who got me
my new apartment.

272
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,755
So you're Elaine's hero.

273
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,592
Yes, it's my life's work.

274
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,953
There are so few true heroes left
in this world.

275
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,237
Yeah, my wife couldn't
make it today.

276
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,113
She's got some thing with her mother.
Who knows what's going on with her?

277
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,797
Don't let anybody kid you.

278
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,632
It's tough.

279
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,949
Well, better load up on some carbos
before the race.

280
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,989
- Oh, the marathon is great, isn't it?
- Oh, yes. Particularly if you're not in it.

281
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,720
- I wish we had a view of the finish line.
- What's to see?

282
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,917
A woman from Norway, a guy
from Kenya and 20,000 losers.

283
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,711
My wife started getting on me
about the lawn today.

284
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,633
I tell you,
it's one thing after another.

285
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,314
- Is she here?
- No, no, she's working.

286
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,629
What does she do?

287
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,878
She's an entomologist.
You know, bees, flies, gnats.

288
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,473
What about you?

289
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,200
I work for the director
of Madison Square Garden.

290
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,670
It's great. I can get free tickets
to any sporting event in New York.

291
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,995
Anyway, she's a very lucky woman.
Enjoy the race.

292
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,549
But...

293
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,280
Hi, Stan. Joanne. Come in.

294
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,749
Oh, Jerry, this is Joanne
and this is Stan.

295
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,593
They're in my short story class
with Roxanne and me.

296
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,230
Hey, Jerry just got me
a great apartment in his building.

297
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,951
Well, Jerry, it'll be nice
to have a close friend nearby.

298
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,680
- Fantastic.
- She can pop in whenever she wants.

299
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,068
I know.

300
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,118
- She doesn't even need to knock.
- It's tremendous.

301
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,431
- Any time of day.
- I'm in heaven.

302
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,272
Oh, Rita. Rita, come here.

303
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,637
This is Jerry. He's the one
who got me the apartment.

304
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,994
Oh, hi.

305
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,915
Bob, this is the guy
who got Elaine her apartment.

306
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,513
I'm sorry, I just don't see the big deal
about being a matador.

307
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,274
I mean, the bull charges,
you move the cape...

308
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,112
...what's so hard?

309
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,190
So are you really married?

310
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,512
I've actually heard of single guys who
wear wedding bands to attract women.

311
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,232
You would have to be a real loser
to try something like that.

312
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,470
That's too bad...

313
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,837
...because I really have a thing
for bald guys with glasses.

314
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,832
Hey, everybody,
here come the runners.

315
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,752
Oh, excuse me.

316
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,273
So you and Roxanne
are hitting it off, huh?

317
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,158
- I wouldn't quite say that.
- Really?

318
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,515
From a distance,
you seemed to be coming on to her.

319
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,399
Oh, I'm a guy.
It always looks like that.

320
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,030
Because I was thinking...

321
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,034
...are you at all concerned
that living in the same building...

322
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,510
...will, you know, cramp our styles?

323
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,717
Because I was worried
that there might be a situation...

324
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,269
...in which one of us came home
with somebody.

325
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,192
It could get a little uncomfortable.

326
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,908
But as long as you're okay with it,
it's fine with me.

327
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,788
I've never been able to be
with just one person.

328
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,149
I can, however, carry on
strictly physical relationships...

329
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,198
...which can last
for years and years.

330
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,588
It's a shame you're married.

331
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,279
I'm not.

332
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,718
- It's just a sociological experiment.
- Please.

333
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,315
You have no idea what an idiot is.

334
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,314
Elaine just gave me a chance
to get out, and I didn't take it.

335
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,277
This is an idiot.

336
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,278
Is that right?

337
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,958
I just threw away a lifetime
of guilt-free sex...

338
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,875
...and floor seats for every sporting
event in Madison Square Garden.

339
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,077
So, please, a little respect.

340
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,355
For I am Costanza, lord of the idiots.

341
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,389
You're all winners!

342
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:43,955
But, suddenly,
a new contender has emerged.

343
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,440
George, I didn't sleep at all
last night.

344
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,431
I decided I have to tell her.

345
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,909
I'm just gonna be honest, that's all.

346
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,150
Yes, I'm nervous.

347
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,629
Are you listening to me?

348
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,119
Just put some soap on your finger.
It'll slide right off.

349
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,670
Well, then try axle grease.

350
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,919
I'll call you back after I talk to her.

351
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,398
Well...

352
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,309
...it's all taken care of.

353
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,871
Everything's cool.

354
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,193
- What? What's cool?
- Elaine.

355
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,148
What are you talking about?

356
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,154
I just found a guy who's willing to pay
$1 0,000 for the apartment.

357
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,958
You what? Get out!

358
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,997
- Ten thousand?
- Cash!

359
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,833
- Who would pay that much?
- He's in the music business.

360
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,879
Elaine would never borrow that much
money. Kramer, my God, man.

361
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,600
This is beautiful.
I think I'm in the clear here.

362
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,034
Elaine's not moving in.

363
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,673
I don't have to confront her. She has
no idea I never wanted her to move in.

364
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,829
I'm golden.

365
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,470
Well, occasionally,
I like to help the humans.

366
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,476
- Wow, you're right, that is loud.
- It's just unbelievable.

367
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,551
- They rehearse all the time?
- All the time.

368
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,553
I've been up there six times.
They refuse to stop.

369
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,076
I can't live like this. I don't know what
to do. I'm headed for a breakdown.

370
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,674
- Can't you do something?
- I'm not going up.

371
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,558
- It stinks up there.
- Manny?

372
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,997
I'm not the one who said
they could play till 1 1:00.

373
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,479
He makes up his own rules.

374
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,837
Boy, too bad. If I was up there,
you'd never hear a peep out of me.

375
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,072
- I'm as quiet as a mouse.
- Hey.

376
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,354
I love the one they do
right after this one.

377
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,913
What do you do when a neighbour...

378
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,958
...is making a lot of noise
at 3:00 in the morning?

379
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,793
Can you knock on someone's door
and tell them to keep it down?

380
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,076
You're really altering
your whole self-image.

381
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,993
What am l, Fred Mertz now?
What's happening to me?

382
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,948
Can I do this? Am I a shusher?
I used to be a shushee.

383
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,317
There's a lot of shushing in movie
theatres. People are always shushing.

384
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,196
Doesn't work. Nobody knows
where it's coming from.

385
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,828
They just hear..."Was that a shush?
I think somebody shushed me?"

386
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,197
Some people you can't shush.
There's always a certain group.

387
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,749
They're talking. Everyone
around them is shushing them.

388
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,037
They won't shush.
They're the unshushables.

389
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,471
