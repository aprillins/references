1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,200
I have to tell you that I did get
some very exciting news recently.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,000
I don't know if I should tell you
what it is, because it's not definite yet.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,200
- Come on!
- Come on!

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,000
Well, I will tell you
what I do know so far.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,100
According to the information that
I have in the envelope that I received...

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,200
...it seems...

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,600
...that I may have already won
some very valuable prizes.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,800
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,300
Well, thank you.
It's very nice to hear that.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,900
But in all honesty...

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,900
...I have to say, I didn't even know
I was in this thing.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,300
But according to the readout...

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,300
...it looks like I am among the top
people that they are considering.

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,000
That annoys me about sweepstakes.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
They tease you with,
"You may have already won."

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,900
I'd like once for a sweepstakes
company to have some guts.

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,400
Just tell people the truth one time.
Send out envelopes:

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,200
"You have definitely lost."

19
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,700
You turn it over, giant printing:

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,000
"Not even close."

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,200
You open it,
there's a letter of explanation:

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,400
"Even we cannot believe how badly
you've done in this contest."

23
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,100
To the right.

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
Boy, that took a while.

25
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,900
- Don't get up.
- I'd like to help, but my neck...

26
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
So how long has it been
in the basement?

27
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,700
Since my grandfather died.

28
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,700
I was supposed to send it
to my parents, but they didn't want it.

29
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,700
They said get rid of it,
but I felt funny.

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,800
And then I forgot about it.
It's been sitting there for three years...

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,800
...until he saw it.

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,100
All right, so just take what you want,
and let's get it out of here.

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,600
What's in it?

34
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
Grandpa clothes. I can't wear them.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,900
You want these? Knee socks.
You don't wear knee socks.

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,100
No. Go ahead.

37
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,800
Look at this place.
I can't wait to get it cleaned.

38
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,600
I know somebody who'll do it.

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,000
She's good, she's honest...

40
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,500
No, Elaine's got this writer friend
from Finland. Rava.

41
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,100
Her boyfriend goes to
Columbia grad school.

42
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,400
And he's supposed to do it.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Students can't clean. It's anathema.

44
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,100
They don't like it.

45
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,400
How long you been waiting to squeeze
that into a conversation?

46
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,800
Now, this, I like.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,700
Wait a second.

48
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,600
I can't believe this.

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,800
- Let me see this.
- Wait, wait.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,200
- Let me just see it for a second.
- No. Come on, come on.

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,900
- Oh, my God. It's exactly the same.
- What?

52
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,100
When I was 10 years old, my parents
had this very same statue...

53
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,500
...on the mantel
of our apartment. Exactly.

54
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,800
And one day I grabbed it,
I was using it as a microphone.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I was singing "MacArthur Park."

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
And I got to the part about,
"I'll never have the recipe again"...

57
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,000
...and it slipped out my hand,
and it broke.

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,500
My parents looked at me like
I smashed the Ten Commandments.

59
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,500
To this day, they bring it up.

60
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,500
It was the single most damaging
experience of my life.

61
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,400
Aside from seeing my father naked.

62
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,400
- Come on, I saw it first.
- Kramer, I have to have the statue.

63
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,900
- I got dibs.
- No dibs. I need the statue. Give it!

64
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,800
Spread out.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,500
You numbskulls.

66
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,200
Why don't you just settle it
like mature adults?

67
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
- Potato man.
- No, no.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,700
No potato man. Inka-dink.

69
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,900
Okay.

70
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,000
- Yeah, start with me.
- Yeah. Good, good.

71
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,600
Inka-dink, a bottle of ink
The cork fell out, and you stink

72
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,000
Not because you're dirty
Not because you're clean

73
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,500
Just because you kissed a girl
Behind the magazine

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,700
- And you are...
- Wait a minute. No.

75
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,300
...it
- What? What are you doing?

76
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,300
No, no. Oh, okay. All right.
He's out, I get it.

77
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,000
- No, no, no. I'm it. I win.
- No.

78
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,900
He's it. He wins.

79
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,300
It is good.

80
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,800
Do over. Start with him.

81
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,200
No, no.

82
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,600
Come on, Kramer.
Now, you got the socks.

83
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,200
All right, you can have it.

84
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,300
Okay. I'm gonna take the suit...

85
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,000
...and shoes...

86
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,700
...and the hat.
- All right. Let's go.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,300
Hey, I look like Joe Friday
in Dragnet.

88
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,100
I can't believe I won at inka-dink.

89
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,600
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,800
- Aren't you gonna take it?
- I don't wanna carry it around.

91
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,200
I'll pick it up later.

92
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,200
What about your stuff?

93
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,500
Okay.

94
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,500
All right, let's go. Hey...
You know, you owe me one.

95
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,300
- What?
- The inka-dink. You were it.

96
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,500
- It's bad?
- It's very bad.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If they don't let you be
my editor on this...

98
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,700
...I go to another publisher.
It's that simple.

99
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,000
- You told them that?
- Of course.

100
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,500
Oh, this is so fantastic.
I don't know how to thank you.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,100
Where's this boyfriend of yours?
I can't wait much longer, I got a flight.

102
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,700
He's probably caught in traffic.

103
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,500
Or maybe he's dead.

104
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,100
So, what do you write,
children's books?

105
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
That's Ray.

106
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,600
Greetings. Greetings and salutations.

107
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,000
I beg your forgiveness.
My tardiness was unavoidable.

108
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,400
Rava, my love.

109
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,200
Elaine, dear friend.

110
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,300
And you must be Jerry,
lord of the manor.

111
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,400
My liege. A pleasure to serve you.

112
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,800
All right.

113
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,600
Well, we have to get back to work.

114
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,500
I gotta get to the airport.

115
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,100
Your palace shall sparkle
like the stars in heaven...

116
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,700
...upon your safe arrival, sire.

117
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,000
The toilet brush is under the sink.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't feel comfortable
with a maid either.

119
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,500
There's that guilt when someone's
cleaning your house.

120
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,000
You're sitting on the sofa,
they go by with the vacuum.

121
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,300
"I'm really sorry about this.

122
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,600
I don't know why I left
that stuff over there."

123
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,100
That's why I could never be a maid.
I would have that attitude.

124
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,200
I'd find them, wherever they are.
"I suppose you couldn't do this.

125
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,600
No, don't get up.
Let me clean up your filth.

126
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,700
No, you couldn't dust.
Oh, this is too tough, isn't it?"

127
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,900
He really did an amazing job. Look.

128
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,900
He uncoagulated
the top of the dishwashing liquid.

129
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,900
He cleaned out the bottom
of the little egg cups.

130
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,500
Come here, look at this.

131
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,000
He cleaned in the little one-inch area...

132
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,900
...between the refrigerator
and the counter.

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,200
How'd he get in there?

134
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,500
He must be like Rubber Man.

135
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,900
There's no Rubber Man.

136
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,100
Why did I think there was
a Rubber Man?

137
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
There's Elastic Man, Plastic Man...

138
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,000
- I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

139
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,900
To Rava's. I gotta
pick up her manuscript.

140
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,700
- Oh, wait, I'll go with you.
- Okay.

141
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,400
Elaine, he Windexed
the little peephole.

142
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
So the meeting with Lippman
is all set.

143
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,100
He's the editor in chief.

144
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,900
- I think because of your request.
- Demand.

145
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,700
They're gonna promote me to editor.

146
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,800
Darn tooting.

147
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,400
There's Ray, late as usual.

148
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,500
Well.

149
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,600
This is an unexpected surprise.
And delight.

150
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,100
The once and future king of comedy,
Jerry the first...

151
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,500
...gracing our humble abode.

152
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,200
Rava, we are in the presence
of royalty.

153
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,600
Hey, Ray, listen.

154
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,200
You really did a tremendous job
cleaning that apartment.

155
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,100
But I didn't just clean
your apartment.

156
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,400
It was a ritual, a ceremony.

157
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,000
A celebration of life.

158
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,400
Shouldn't you be
out on a ledge somewhere?

159
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,500
He's funny.

160
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
- Water's boiling. Are we having tea?
- Yes.

161
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,900
Yes. Jerry?

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,300
- Jerry.
- What?

163
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,100
Ray, would you give me
a hand, please?

164
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, I'm coming.

165
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,900
I think that's the statue
from my house.

166
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,000
That looks like the statue
from my house.

167
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,500
- What statue?
- I had a statue.

168
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,000
You do? I never saw a statue.

169
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,800
My grandfather gave me a statue.

170
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,200
- Since when?
- What's the difference? That's the one.

171
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,700
He ripped me off.
This guy ripped me off.

172
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,400
Do you take sugar?

173
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,600
- No.
- No.

174
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,600
I can't believe it.
This guy ripped me off.

175
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,700
- Do you realize what you're saying?
- Yes, this guy ripped me off.

176
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,700
He stole that statue
right out of my house.

177
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,800
Lemon?

178
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,000
- Sure.
- Yeah.

179
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,000
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

180
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,300
- 99-percent sure.
- 99-percent sure?

181
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Sweet elixir, its fragrant nectar
a soothing balm for the soul.

182
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,900
Those are the pastries.
Take care of that.

183
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm gonna get Elaine the manuscript.

184
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
The pastries.

185
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,700
Maybe it just looks the same.
It's a coincidence.

186
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,600
Coincidence? This guy's in
my apartment, and by coincidence...

187
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,900
...he has the exact same statue
in his apartment?

188
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,200
- I never saw any statue.
- I had a statue.

189
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,500
What should I do?

190
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,600
I'll call Kramer.
He can check my house.

191
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,400
Oh, Jerry.

192
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,300
- Don't blow this for me.
- Don't worry.

193
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,700
Kramer.

194
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,400
It's Jerry. Jerry.

195
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,600
From next door.
Never mind where I am.

196
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,900
Yes, Jerry Seinfeld.

197
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,700
Ma, I told you...

198
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,600
...just dip the bread in the batter...

199
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,800
...and put it in the pan.

200
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,900
Okay, bye. My mother.

201
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:07,000
She forgot how to make
French toast.

202
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,300
You know how mothers are.

203
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,000
My mother left us
when I was 6 years old.

204
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,300
All seven of us.
We never heard from her again.

205
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,600
I hope she's rotting
in an alley somewhere.

206
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,300
My mom's down in Florida.

207
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,300
She's got one of those condos.

208
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,100
Hot down there in the summer.
You ever been down there?

209
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,400
I love these pastries.

210
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,500
In Scandinavian mythology,
the pastries were the food of the gods.

211
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,800
Listen, I just remembered, I'm...

212
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,200
...getting a facial.

213
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,200
Oh, I'll see you tomorrow morning.

214
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,500
- How about dinner?
- No, I don't eat dinner.

215
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,700
Dinner's for suckers.

216
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,800
Yeah, okay.

217
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,700
Thanks anyway. Bye.

218
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,300
Nope.

219
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,500
Cop says it's my word against his.
There's nothing they can do.

220
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,200
Let's go get him.

221
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,600
- Yeah, right.
- We can't let him get away with this.

222
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,900
You realize how crazy
he had to be to do this?

223
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,800
He knew I was gonna know
it's missing and that he took it.

224
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,300
And of all things to take.

225
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,400
I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo.
He's crazy.

226
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,300
You wanna go get him?

227
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,900
If he's crazy,
you should just forget it.

228
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,300
Forget it?

229
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
I already called my parents.

230
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,900
I told them to expect
the surprise of a lifetime.

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,400
My mother's making
her roasted potatoes.

232
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,700
George, do you realize...

233
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,100
...that Rava has asked me
to edit her book?

234
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,700
Who is this Rava?

235
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,800
I say we get him.

236
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,100
- Let me just call him.
- I'll call him.

237
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,100
Hello, Ray?

238
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,400
Hi, Ray. This is Rava's friend,
Elaine's friend, Jerry.

239
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,400
Yeah, the king of comedy, right.

240
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,400
Listen, you know that statue
on your mantel...

241
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,400
...the one with...? The blue lady?
Would you shut up?!

242
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,500
Yeah. Oh, you don't want to talk
about it over the phone.

243
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,000
You don't want Rava to hear.

244
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,700
Yeah, I understand.

245
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
You know the coffee shop
near my house, Monk's?

246
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,100
All right, tomorrow, 1:00.

247
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,500
Great. Okay, bye.

248
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,500
All right, look. Look, look.

249
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,100
- Let's say he stole it.
- Oh, he stole it.

250
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,400
You can't do anything about it.

251
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,100
The cops won't do anything.

252
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,400
What, are you gonna go fight him?
Why don't you just forget it.

253
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,800
- No.
- No.

254
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,900
Thought you said 1:00.

255
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,200
Relax. He's late. He's always late.
It's part of his m.o.

256
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,100
Remember, don't take any crap.

257
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,900
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.

258
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,800
- I'll be right here.
- That's comforting.

259
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He's coming.

260
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,500
Ray.

261
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,300
Jerry.

262
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,600
I can't believe you asked me
about that statue.

263
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,900
You know how much trouble
you could've gotten me in?

264
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,600
- Well, l...
- Rava was standing right next to me.

265
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,700
I never told her
where I got the statue.

266
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,000
- I wonder why.
- Well, just give it back...

267
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,400
...and I won't say anything.

268
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,100
- Give it back?
- Yeah.

269
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,600
- What are you talking about?
- What's he talking about?

270
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,700
- I'm talking about the statue.
- Yeah, me too.

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,700
- Give it back to whom?
- Me.

272
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,500
- You?
- Yeah, me.

273
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,000
- I'm not getting this.
- You already got it.

274
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,600
Ray, I had a statue in my house.

275
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,300
You were in my house.

276
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,100
And then I saw it in your house.

277
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,500
- What are you saying?
- What am I saying?

278
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,500
Take a wild guess.

279
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Are you saying I stole your statue?

280
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,700
- What a mind.
- Well, l...

281
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,300
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.

282
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,200
For your information,
I got that statue in a pawnshop.

283
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,900
- Pawnshop?
- A pawnshop?

284
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,500
In Chinatown, with money I earned
cleaning apartments.

285
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,100
- Cleaning them out.
- Oh, excuse me.

286
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
Yeah.

287
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,900
Look, Ray, you were the only person
in my house.

288
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,800
What's behind this?
It's Rava, isn't it?

289
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,100
Again with the Rava.

290
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,400
- You want her.
- No, she's a little too cheery for me.

291
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,600
She's from Finland, for crying out
loud. Finland! Do you understand?

292
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,200
I know Finland. They're neutral.

293
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,000
Is it me?
Do I rub you the wrong way?

294
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,100
No, actually, I find you quite charming.
A bit verbose at times.

295
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,100
"I find you so charming." You wuss.

296
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,700
- Did you call me a wuss?
- What did you say?

297
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,300
I said, "luss."

298
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,700
I'm at a "luss."

299
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,100
I'd love to take you to the pawnshop
where I got it.

300
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,700
That's not necessary.

301
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,200
You know, maybe it's not
that bad an idea.

302
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,100
And I would love to.
Nothing would please me more.

303
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,700
But unfortunately, the guy retired
and moved to Singapore.

304
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,500
Singapore? Do you hear this?

305
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,500
If you really want, maybe I can
contact the guy in Singapore.

306
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,800
Have him make a Photostat
of the receipt...

307
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,800
...and send it over.
- That's it.

308
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,200
That's it! I can't take it.
I can't take it anymore!

309
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,800
You stole the statue!
You're a thief! You're a liar!

310
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,900
- George.
- Who is this?

311
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,600
I'm the judge and the jury, pal.
And the verdict is, guilty!

312
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,200
- What is going on here?
- Guilty!

313
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,100
- Your friend is crazy.
- Oh, I'm crazy!

314
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,800
- George, George.
- I've gotta get going. I have a class.

315
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,600
Oh, a class, huh? A class.
At Columbia?

316
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,400
Let me tell you something.
I called the registrar's office.

317
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,500
I checked you out.
They have no record...

318
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,900
...of a Ray Thomas at that school,
you liar!

319
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,800
That is because I am registered
under my full legal name...

320
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,400
...Raymond Thomas Wochinski.

321
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,200
Ray Thomas is
my professional name.

322
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,600
You mean "alias."

323
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,600
You are starting to make me angry.

324
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
Well...

325
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,000
...that was bound to happen.

326
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,000
I hope you think about
what you've done here today.

327
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,500
And if you wanna call
and apologize...

328
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,000
...you know where to reach me.

329
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,500
- Hey, Ray.
- Yes?

330
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,300
How did you get the goop out of
the top of the dishwashing liquid?

331
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,700
It was like a brand-new nozzle.

332
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,400
- Nervous?
- Why should I be?

333
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,800
Yeah. Right.

334
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,400
Your notes were very insightful.

335
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,300
The book is great.

336
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,700
Did you go out last night?

337
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,700
No, we made love on the floor
like two animals.

338
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,900
Ray is insatiable.

339
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,800
They all are.

340
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,700
Was Jerry?

341
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I can't remember.

342
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,100
You know, Ray is very upset
over these accusations.

343
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,100
I'm staying out of this one.
This is between them.

344
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,800
I am not getting involved.

345
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,600
So you think he stole it?

346
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,200
You have to admit,
the circumstantial evidence...

347
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,800
I admit nothing.

348
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,500
Will you put that cigarette out,
please?

349
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,500
I mean, he was in the apartment...

350
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,800
...and then it's gone,
and it's in your apartment.

351
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,900
- Maybe you think we're in cahoots.
- No.

352
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,500
But it's quite a coincidence.

353
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,900
Yes, that's all, a coincidence.

354
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,100
Big coincidence.

355
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,600
Not a big coincidence.
A coincidence.

356
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,000
No, that's a big coincidence.

357
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,500
That's what a coincidence is.

358
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,200
There are no small coincidences
and big coincidences.

359
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,300
No. There are degrees
of coincidences.

360
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,800
No. There are only coincidences.
Ask anyone.

361
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,300
Are there big coincidences
and small coincidences...

362
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,100
...or just coincidences?

363
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,500
Well?

364
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,700
Will you put that cigarette out?

365
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,000
Maybe I put it out on your face.

366
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,800
It's just like Ray said.

367
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,900
You and Jerry, you're jealous
of our love. You're trying to destroy us.

368
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,500
Shouldn't you be
out on a ledge somewhere?

369
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,900
Ma, will you stop?

370
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,800
It's just a statue.

371
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,600
How is it my fault? It was stolen.
I didn't even touch it this time.

372
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Okay, fine.

373
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,100
I don't see why this should affect
the potatoes.

374
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,300
Okay! Goodbye.

375
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,800
She doesn't react to disappointment
very well.

376
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,100
Unlike me.

377
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,100
I'm not happy about this.

378
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,100
Why don't we just throw a
Molotov cocktail through their window.

379
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,900
There's just no justice.

380
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,800
This experience has changed me.

381
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,600
It's made me more cynical,
more bitter, more jaded.

382
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,300
- Really?
- Sure. Why not?

383
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,300
How do you think I feel?

384
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,400
Instead of editing the first novel
of a major young writing talent...

385
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,700
...I am proofreading
a food-allergy cookbook.

386
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,200
- Can't you talk to your boss?
- I did.

387
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,700
He loves Rava.

388
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,200
Worse, he loves Ray.

389
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,000
And he doesn't think
you're funny at all.

390
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
I'm not happy about this.

391
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,300
Perhaps we can take comfort
in the knowledge...

392
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,300
...that in the next world,
Ray will be the recipient...

393
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,700
...of a much larger and more harsh
brand of justice.

394
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,700
Yeah, he'll have my parents.

395
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,100
Police. Open up!

396
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,500
Police?

397
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,100
- Freeze, mama!
- Hey, hey...

398
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,300
Shut up! Spread them.

399
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,900
I said, spread them!

400
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,300
You're in big trouble, son.

401
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,900
Burglary, grand larceny...

402
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,500
...possession of stolen goods.

403
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,000
- And murder!
- Murder?

404
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,000
Shut up! Keep them spread.

405
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,800
You just make love
to that wall, pervert.

406
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,500
Hey, I think you have me confused
with somebody else.

407
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,400
- Is your name Ray?
- Yeah.

408
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,800
Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for!

409
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,100
Hey. Hey, are you a cop?

410
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,700
Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop.
I'm a damn good cop!

411
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,600
And today's your lucky day, junior.

412
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,000
Because I'm gonna let you off
with just a warning.

413
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,300
Any more of this criminal activity,
and you'll be sorry. You got me?

414
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,100
I don't know
what you're talking about.

415
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,100
Good, good. Let's keep it that way.

416
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,100
All right, all right.
What's the big hubbub, bub?

417
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,900
Kramer, I can't believe it.

418
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,100
- Oh, you're my hero!
- Yeah.

419
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,600
- Kramer, what did you do?
- Well, let's put it this way:

420
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,300
I didn't take him to People's Court.

421
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,900
I feel like a huge weight has been
lifted off my shoulders.

422
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,900
l... I feel happy!

423
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,600
Kramer, I don't know
how to thank you.

424
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,700
Well, I'll think of something.

425
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,900
People are going to steal from you.
You can't stop them.

426
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,600
But everybody has their own little
personal security things.

427
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,100
Things that they think will foil the
crooks, you know, in your mind.

428
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,300
You go to the beach, go in the water.
Put your wallet in the sneaker.

429
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,200
Who's gonna know?

430
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,900
What criminal mind could penetrate
this fortress of security?

431
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,200
"I tied a bow.

432
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,900
They can't get through that."

433
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,600
"I put the wallet down
by the toe of the sneaker.

434
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
They never look there.
They check the heel, they move on."

435
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
