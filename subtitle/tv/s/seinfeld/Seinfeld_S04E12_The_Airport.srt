1
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:07,704
Everything on planes is tiny. Tiny
food, tiny liquor bottles, tiny pillows...

2
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,975
...tiny bathroom,
tiny sink, tiny soap.

3
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:13,177
Everyone's in a cramped seat
working on a tiny computer.

4
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:15,686
Always a small problem.
"Be a slight delay.

5
00:00:15,857 --> 00:00:18,451
You'll be a bit late.
If you could be a little patient.

6
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:21,026
We're just trying to get
one of those little trucks...

7
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:23,220
...to pull us a little closer
to the Jetway...

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,298
...so you can walk down
the narrow hallway.

9
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:28,799
There'll be a man in a tight suit.
He'll tell you you have little time...

10
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:32,133
...to make your connecting flight.
So move it."

11
00:00:44,118 --> 00:00:45,881
Hey, could you do me a favor?

12
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:47,988
Could you shut up?

13
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:50,089
Open the window, please.
It's hot in here.

14
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,625
- You're wearing that heavy jacket.
- Fine, I'll take it off. Grab the wheel.

15
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:55,854
- I don't want to do that.
- Come on. Just do it.

16
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,692
- No, I don't like to do this.
- Elaine, just get it.

17
00:00:58,866 --> 00:01:00,993
- My hand is stuck.
- Okay, don't fool around.

18
00:01:01,169 --> 00:01:03,535
- My hand. My hand!
- Don't... Jer... All right, fine.

19
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:05,866
Elaine.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,667
Hey, guess what.

21
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:10,902
- This window doesn't work.
- I hate rental cars. Nothing ever works.

22
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,979
Window doesn't work.
Radio doesn't work.

23
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:14,774
And it smells like a cheap hooker.

24
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:16,548
Or is that you?

25
00:01:16,718 --> 00:01:19,346
Give me 10 bucks and find out.

26
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,817
So this worked out pretty good.

27
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:26,757
Them giving me an extra ticket. You
get a trip to St. Louis. I did my gig.

28
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:29,362
- You got to see your sister.
- Yeah, it worked out good.

29
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,963
- And here's the beauty.
- What?

30
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,827
George is picking us up
at the airport.

31
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,060
- Get out of here. Why?
- You know that awning...

32
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:37,295
...outside my building?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,303
He always brags
about his vertical leap...

34
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,568
...so I bet him 50 bucks that
he couldn't touch the awning.

35
00:01:42,744 --> 00:01:46,373
- So, what happened?
- He didn't come within 2 feet of it.

36
00:01:46,614 --> 00:01:48,673
He's waving at it.

37
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,377
So I told him if he picks us up at the
airport, he wouldn't have to pay me.

38
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:54,578
Hey, how we doing on time?

39
00:01:54,756 --> 00:01:56,155
Timed out perfectly.

40
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,555
Drop off the car, pick up the rental-car
shuttle, we walk on the plane.

41
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,528
- Wait up!
- Wait up!

42
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:07,361
- Sorry.
- Wait!

43
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,407
- Where you going?
- JFK.

44
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,875
I need some small bills
for a tip, got any?

45
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:20,276
- Yeah. You want a 5?
- Give me a 10.

46
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:22,712
- You're giving him $ 10?
- Well, we got three bags.

47
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:25,011
- That's a pretty big tip.
- That's what they get.

48
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,416
- They don't get that much.
- Let's ask him.

49
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:30,182
- You can't ask him.
- Let's see what he says.

50
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:32,349
- Jerry, we don't have time.
- Two seconds.

51
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:33,892
Excuse me.

52
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:35,859
My friend and I
were having a discussion.

53
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,863
We were just wondering
what you usually get for a tip.

54
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:42,298
- Depends on the person and the bag.
- How about people like us?

55
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,732
People like you?

56
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:46,066
Not much.
You don't know what you're doing.

57
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,074
- Come on, seriously.
- Well, since you asked.

58
00:02:50,244 --> 00:02:52,974
Usually, I get $5 a bag.

59
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:55,314
- What?
- That's right.

60
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:59,317
- Five dollars a bag? I don't think so.
- Look, you asked, I told you.

61
00:02:59,887 --> 00:03:02,082
You got some nerve
trying to take advantage of us.

62
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:05,123
All right, look, we're late.
Thank you very much.

63
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:07,591
- You're lucky I don't report you.
- Come on.

64
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,756
JFK.

65
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,766
Honolulu.

66
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,894
Wait up.

67
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,670
See? Never be late
for a plane with a girl.

68
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:24,608
Because a girl runs like a girl, with the
little steps and the arms flailing out.

69
00:03:24,812 --> 00:03:27,337
You wanna make this plane,
you gotta run like a man.

70
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:29,745
Get your knees up!

71
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:36,417
- The flight's been canceled?
- Everything into JFK is booked.

72
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,616
Wait, I have two seats
into La Guardia...

73
00:03:38,793 --> 00:03:40,852
...but they're not together.
It's boarding now.

74
00:03:41,028 --> 00:03:42,928
- We'll take them.
- We won't sit together?

75
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,792
So what? It's not long. You'll read.

76
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:47,196
What about George?
He's picking us up at Kennedy.

77
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:48,858
- We'll call him.
- There's no time.

78
00:03:49,036 --> 00:03:50,469
- Is there time?
- There's no time.

79
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:52,833
There's no time.
We'll call him from the plane.

80
00:03:53,007 --> 00:03:55,669
I have one seat in first class
and one in coach.

81
00:03:55,843 --> 00:03:58,710
The price is the same
because your flight was canceled.

82
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,005
Well...

83
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:02,877
I'll take the first class.

84
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,347
- Jerry.
- What?

85
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:06,146
Why should you get
the first class?

86
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,515
Elaine, have you ever
flown first class?

87
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,316
- No.
- All right, then.

88
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:12,015
You won't know
what you're missing.

89
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:14,718
I've flown first class, Elaine.
I can't go back to coach.

90
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:17,956
- I can't. I won't.
- You flew here coach.

91
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,624
- Yeah, that's a point.
- All right, fine. I don't care.

92
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,170
The plane crashes, everybody in
first class is gonna die anyway.

93
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,671
Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.

94
00:04:31,512 --> 00:04:33,446
Third row, right.

95
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:35,741
Oh, you're in here, sir.
Welcome aboard.

96
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:37,851
Bon voyage, Lainey.

97
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,222
Oh, excuse me.

98
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,830
Excuse me, Miss.
I think you're sitting in my seat.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,228
What?

100
00:04:54,402 --> 00:04:56,427
- Yeah, 13C. That's me.
- Sorry.

101
00:04:56,604 --> 00:04:58,333
No, that's all right.

102
00:05:13,788 --> 00:05:17,053
I never check my bags. Can't stand
that waiting in the baggage area.

103
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,253
Great.

104
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:24,697
Help me.

105
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:31,432
Excuse me.
I think you're in my seat.

106
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:33,897
Oh, really?

107
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:35,941
My mistake.

108
00:05:36,978 --> 00:05:38,969
My mistake.

109
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,610
Thank you.

110
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:49,756
- Hey, thanks for coming with me.
- Oh, yeah.

111
00:05:49,924 --> 00:05:52,324
What made you think
you could touch that awning?

112
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:55,052
I confused it with another awning.

113
00:05:55,663 --> 00:05:57,563
Man.

114
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,666
- So how we doing on time?
- We're perfect.

115
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:03,099
I timed this out so we'd
pull up at the terminal...

116
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:05,967
...exactly 17 minutes after their flight
is supposed to land.

117
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,404
That gives them enough time
to get off the plane...

118
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:12,774
...pick up their bags, and be walking
out of the terminal as we roll up.

119
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:14,847
I tell you, it's a thing of beauty.

120
00:06:15,016 --> 00:06:18,975
I cannot express to you the feeling
I get from a perfect pickup.

121
00:06:19,153 --> 00:06:20,780
- What are you doing?
- What?

122
00:06:20,955 --> 00:06:24,015
What are you getting on the
Long Island Expressway for?

123
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:27,160
You know what the traffic will be like?
This is a suicide mission!

124
00:06:27,328 --> 00:06:30,388
- Will you relax?
- I had it perfectly timed out.

125
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:33,556
The Grand Central. The Van Wyck.
You've destroyed my whole timing.

126
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:35,099
This is the best way to go.

127
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,998
Do you know what happens
if I miss him?

128
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:39,639
I don't get credit for the pickup,
and I lose my $50.

129
00:06:39,807 --> 00:06:41,968
George, there's no traffic
at this time. Come on.

130
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:43,337
Really?

131
00:06:43,511 --> 00:06:46,275
If anything, we'll probably
get there early.

132
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:50,281
I'll have a chance to
go to the duty-free shop.

133
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,141
- The duty-free shop?
- Yeah.

134
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:57,480
Duty-free is the biggest
sucker deal in retail.

135
00:06:57,658 --> 00:06:59,785
- You know how much duty is?
- Duty?

136
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:04,161
- Yeah. You know how much duty is?
- No, I don't know how much duty is.

137
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:07,563
Duty's nothing. It's like sales tax.

138
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:10,533
Well, I'd still like to stop
at the duty-free shop.

139
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,874
I like to stop
At the duty-free shop

140
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:17,670
I like to stop
At the duty-free shop

141
00:07:17,845 --> 00:07:20,473
I like to stop
At the duty-free shop

142
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,414
So he says,
"Squeeze your breasts together."

143
00:07:25,586 --> 00:07:29,352
And I say, "I thought
this was an ad for shoes."

144
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,887
Oh, my.

145
00:07:35,596 --> 00:07:37,393
- Is that the new Esquire?
- Yeah.

146
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:40,033
Turn to page 146.

147
00:07:42,803 --> 00:07:45,363
Coming out of the shower.

148
00:07:46,173 --> 00:07:48,937
Good thing they gave you that
washcloth to cover yourself up.

149
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:51,272
What is this an ad for?

150
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:54,175
See those wrinkled jeans
slung over the chair?

151
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,545
Way in the background,
out of focus?

152
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,059
How does it look on your side?

153
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,126
We'll get there.

154
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:17,099
Oh, look at this.

155
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:20,206
He's sleeping, and I have to go
to the bathroom.

156
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,569
Maybe he'll wake up soon.

157
00:08:22,843 --> 00:08:25,368
What if my kidneys burst?

158
00:08:25,946 --> 00:08:29,973
Is it worth it not to wake this man up
to damage a major organ?

159
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:34,588
I hope this disgusting slob
appreciates what I'm doing for him.

160
00:08:35,122 --> 00:08:38,580
Yeah, make a little more noise
with your gum. That's helpful.

161
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:43,956
They're not here.
You cost me 50 bucks.

162
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:48,397
Look at you. You run like a girl. Come
on. Run like a man. Lift your knees.

163
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:54,404
We're wasting our time here.
We're a half-hour late.

164
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,133
They probably took it
off the board!

165
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,006
No, there it is. Right there, 133.
And it's canceled.

166
00:08:59,513 --> 00:09:02,209
Canceled?
Do I still get credit for the pickup?

167
00:09:02,383 --> 00:09:04,544
- I was here.
- Let's check at the ticket counter.

168
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:07,915
There it is, honey.
Gate 18A, 8:30.

169
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,122
Did you see that guy?

170
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:13,988
- No. What guy?
- That guy. He was...

171
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:15,856
...standing right here.
- No, I didn't.

172
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,497
Go over to the ticket counter.

173
00:09:17,665 --> 00:09:20,190
I'll go to the gift shop and
get a copy of TIME magazine.

174
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:23,598
There's supposed to be a blurb about
Jerry. I think he mentioned my name.

175
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,762
I know that guy.

176
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,498
Yeah.

177
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,772
Gotta get my TIME magazine.
Never miss my TIME.

178
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,471
Okay, get your magazine.
Let's get out of here.

179
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:37,448
Hey. I was gonna take that.

180
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,887
Gee, I'm sorry. I got here first.

181
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:43,717
- I don't care. I want the magazine.
- Okay, let's go.

182
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:46,382
You don't understand.
There's a blurb about me in this.

183
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,552
A blurb? You're a blurb.
Check out the cover, idiot.

184
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,220
- Let's go.
- Just give me second.

185
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:54,128
- I want the magazine!
- No.

186
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:57,566
You know what I would do to you
if I wasn't in these shackles?

187
00:09:57,738 --> 00:10:01,731
But you are, Blanche.
You are in the shackles.

188
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:03,536
You little son of a...

189
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:09,311
Oh, I can't wait to read
my TIME magazine. Last copy too.

190
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,883
Maybe I'll read it tomorrow,
in the park.

191
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:16,318
Supposed to be a beautiful day.
Have a nice life...

192
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,550
...sentence, that is. You miserable...

193
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:23,527
They're on a different flight.

194
00:10:23,697 --> 00:10:26,325
They're scheduled to land
in half an hour at La Guardia.

195
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,762
La Guardia? Right, come on.

196
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:29,197
- Wait a second.
- Come on.

197
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,737
- Where do I know that guy from?
- We gotta go, come on.

198
00:10:33,107 --> 00:10:36,565
Wake up, you human slug.
Wake up.

199
00:10:36,744 --> 00:10:39,235
Wake up!

200
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,676
I can't hold it anymore.

201
00:10:45,219 --> 00:10:47,653
Excuse me.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

202
00:10:47,821 --> 00:10:49,186
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

203
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,886
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:56,092
Can you move that?

205
00:10:56,263 --> 00:10:58,891
Would you move
your seat up, please?

206
00:11:10,277 --> 00:11:13,713
Oh, my, that is refreshing.

207
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,815
Would you care for some slippers?

208
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:18,178
- Sounds lovely.
- Here you are.

209
00:11:18,352 --> 00:11:20,547
Thank you very much. May I?

210
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:22,986
Please.

211
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:30,420
Why, it's a perfect fit.
You must be Cinderella.

212
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:37,467
My name is not mentioned
in this blurb.

213
00:11:37,638 --> 00:11:40,266
- That's it. It's Grossbard.
- Do you believe this?

214
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:43,069
- Nowhere to be found.
- I knew that face looked familiar.

215
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,077
- It's Grossbard.
- Who's Grossbard?

216
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:49,239
When I lived on Third Avenue
and 18th Street, 20 years ago...

217
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:52,544
...I had this roommate who was
always behind in his rent.

218
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,623
One month, he asked me to loan him
his share of the rent, 240 bucks.

219
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,486
He took the cash and...

220
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,888
...disappears.

221
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:04,258
I tried to find him. I went to his
girlfriend's house, even his family.

222
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:06,991
Never got that money back.
He screwed me.

223
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:09,658
And that's the guy. John Grossbard.

224
00:12:09,837 --> 00:12:12,670
Kramer, come on.
It was 240 bucks 20 years ago.

225
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,967
- I'm gonna turn around, get that guy.
- You can't.

226
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:17,269
- Let go of me.
- Kramer, you cannot go back.

227
00:12:17,444 --> 00:12:20,004
Kramer, you cannot abandon
people in an airport pickup.

228
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,605
It's a binding social contract.

229
00:12:23,183 --> 00:12:27,051
We must go forward. Not back.

230
00:12:44,872 --> 00:12:48,239
Tia, did you see all the flowers
in that bathroom?

231
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,969
- It's like an English garden in there.
- They're beautiful.

232
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,476
They're gardenias, mostly.

233
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:56,343
- I thought I smelled lilac.
- Yes, there are a few of those too.

234
00:12:56,517 --> 00:12:57,916
It's almost overwhelming.

235
00:12:58,085 --> 00:13:00,144
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain.

236
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,154
Due to equipment problems
on the runway at La Guardia...

237
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:07,761
...we've been instructed by the tower
to reroute and land at JFK.

238
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:10,158
We apologize
for any inconvenience.

239
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,060
What did he say?
What did he say?

240
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:20,404
- Well, you're not gonna believe it.
- What?

241
00:13:20,574 --> 00:13:23,202
The plane's rerouted back
to Kennedy. We got 45 minutes.

242
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:28,974
Let's go. Listen to the bell,
Grossbard. It tolls for thee.

243
00:13:35,556 --> 00:13:37,922
We have some
delicious Chateaubriand.

244
00:13:38,092 --> 00:13:41,459
My personal favorite.
Or if you prefer something lighter...

245
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:46,861
...a poached Dover sole in a delicate
white-wine sauce with a hint of saffron.

246
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,434
Oh, saffron. That sounds good.

247
00:13:49,603 --> 00:13:52,231
And today we're featuring wines
from the Tuscany region.

248
00:13:53,073 --> 00:13:55,701
- Tuscany.
- Tuscany.

249
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:03,077
Hi. Can I get to my seat?

250
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:06,583
You're just gonna have to wait.

251
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:10,846
I'm right there. You just passed it.
I'm sitting next to that guy.

252
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:13,652
You're not supposed to get up
during the food service.

253
00:14:13,827 --> 00:14:16,125
Well, nobody told me that.

254
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,627
Look. This plane is full.

255
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,962
I got a lot of people to serve.
Now, please.

256
00:14:22,136 --> 00:14:24,263
You're just gonna have to wait.

257
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,738
There it is. Gate 46.
We got plenty of time.

258
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,901
Grossbard's plane
leaves in 10 minutes.

259
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,569
I've still got time to catch him.

260
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,443
How? He probably boarded
the plane already.

261
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,511
Give me your credit card.

262
00:14:38,685 --> 00:14:41,017
- My credit card?
- Give it to me. Don't ask questions.

263
00:14:41,188 --> 00:14:43,884
I'm not giving you my card
unless you tell me what it's for.

264
00:14:44,057 --> 00:14:46,025
To buy a ticket
to get on that flight.

265
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,823
You'll spend more for the ticket
than you'll get from Grossbard.

266
00:14:49,997 --> 00:14:51,328
I'm not gonna use the ticket.

267
00:14:51,498 --> 00:14:54,661
I'll get my money, get off the plane,
turn your ticket in for a refund.

268
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:56,097
Not gonna cost you a dime.

269
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,434
- Come on, give me the card.
- This is a great idea. Here.

270
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:04,407
Use this one. I get frequent flyer
miles with every purchase.

271
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:06,478
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

272
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,945
Get two tickets.

273
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,584
You're returning it anyway,
what's the difference?

274
00:15:11,752 --> 00:15:15,711
- I'll get double the bonus miles.
- Yes. Yes.

275
00:15:17,724 --> 00:15:18,952
Excuse me.

276
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,788
I'm sorry to make you do this,
but I got stuck in the aisle.

277
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,987
The flight attendant
wouldn't let me through.

278
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:26,029
There's no way
to get around that cart.

279
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,532
You're not supposed to get up
during food service.

280
00:15:28,702 --> 00:15:31,034
I'll try and remember that.

281
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:37,004
Where's my meal?

282
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:41,546
He asked me. But you were gone
so long, I thought you switched seats.

283
00:15:41,748 --> 00:15:45,684
Excuse me. Excuse me,
I didn't get a meal.

284
00:15:45,853 --> 00:15:48,515
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

285
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:51,749
I would know if a tray of food
had been served to me.

286
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:55,924
- Would you?
- Yes.

287
00:15:56,763 --> 00:15:58,663
Well, the only meal left
is a kosher meal.

288
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:01,958
A kosher meal?
I don't want a kosher meal.

289
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:04,399
I don't even know
what a kosher meal is.

290
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:07,870
I think it means when a rabbi
has inspected it or something.

291
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:12,034
No, no, it all has to do
with the way they kill the pig.

292
00:16:12,246 --> 00:16:15,682
- Come on, but they don't eat pigs.
- They do if it's killed right.

293
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,215
- Under a rabbi's supervision.
- Oh, you know what?

294
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:19,977
I ordered the kosher meal.

295
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:24,590
- Then why didn't you take it?
- I ordered it six weeks ago. I forgot.

296
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:27,124
You're eating my food.

297
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:30,559
Hey, I got earplugs to collect.
Do you want it or not?

298
00:16:32,766 --> 00:16:35,667
- This is the best sundae I've ever had.
- Oh, man.

299
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:37,269
You know what?

300
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:39,029
They got the fudge on the bottom.

301
00:16:39,673 --> 00:16:42,540
You see? That enables you to
control your fudge distribution...

302
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,540
...as you're eating your ice cream.

303
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:47,942
I never met a man who knew
so much about nothing.

304
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:49,810
Thank you.

305
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,823
- More anything?
- More everything.

306
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:05,596
Look. I did good.
I got supersavers. Come on.

307
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:07,324
Supersavers? Are they refundable?

308
00:17:10,604 --> 00:17:12,834
You bought nonrefundable tickets.
You idiot.

309
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:15,338
She talked me into it.
Said it was the best deal.

310
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:17,977
- Do you know how much this'll cost?
- I'll tell you what.

311
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:19,476
I'll split it with you, huh?

312
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:33,351
- Listen, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Okay, okay.

313
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:41,528
Hey.

314
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:44,698
- How about that, huh?
- Excuse me?

315
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:46,702
- Do you recognize me?
- No.

316
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:49,273
- Come on. Twenty years ago.
- What?

317
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,276
- Eighteenth Street?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

318
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,277
Give me your money.
Where's your wallet?

319
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,881
The $240.

320
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:59,348
Just a minute.

321
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,445
Hey, buddy.

322
00:18:08,929 --> 00:18:09,918
Kramer!

323
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:15,901
George!

324
00:18:40,227 --> 00:18:42,593
Sorry. I'm sorry.

325
00:18:42,763 --> 00:18:44,321
Sorry.

326
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:04,078
Excuse me.

327
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:08,784
Excuse me.

328
00:19:08,955 --> 00:19:12,914
What? Oh, no, nothing for me,
thank you. I'm fine.

329
00:19:13,093 --> 00:19:15,118
What is your name?

330
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:16,523
Elaine Benes.

331
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,058
You're going to have to
go back to coach.

332
00:19:22,235 --> 00:19:23,930
But there was nobody sitting here.

333
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:27,562
Yes, but you're still not allowed.
These seats are very expensive.

334
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:31,734
No. Please don't send me back there.
I'll do anything. It's so nice up here.

335
00:19:31,912 --> 00:19:34,676
It's so comfortable up here.
I don't wanna go back there.

336
00:19:34,848 --> 00:19:36,782
Please, don't send me back there.

337
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:39,849
Oh, you got cookies.

338
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:42,312
You're going to have to
go back to your seat.

339
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:46,953
Okay, fine. I'll go back.

340
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:51,425
You know, our goal should be
a society without classes.

341
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,995
Do you realize the people up here
are getting cookies?!

342
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,605
What is all the racket back there?

343
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:06,234
You're trying to relax on the plane, and
this is what you have to put up with.

344
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,607
What is going on?

345
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:10,545
Sir, this woman tried
to sneak into first class.

346
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:12,446
Oh, you see, that's terrible.

347
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:14,519
The problem is
that curtain is no security.

348
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:17,521
There really should be
a locking door.

349
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:20,717
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

350
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:22,953
Sorry.

351
00:20:25,866 --> 00:20:26,855
Hey!

352
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:31,135
Come on. Let go of me. I'm telling
you, I didn't do anything wrong.

353
00:20:31,304 --> 00:20:35,798
- That guy owes me 240 bucks.
- Listen, pal, you're in big trouble.

354
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:55,217
Couldn't be.

355
00:21:00,167 --> 00:21:02,567
Where are they already?
I don't see them anywhere.

356
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:05,432
I got my bags. I'm ready to go.

357
00:21:05,906 --> 00:21:07,874
Yeah, you got your bags.

358
00:21:14,414 --> 00:21:17,178
That was the worst flight
I've ever been on in my entire life.

359
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,908
Yeah, me too.

360
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,578
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

361
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:26,515
It's a business thing.

362
00:21:30,564 --> 00:21:32,191
Hey.

363
00:21:32,365 --> 00:21:34,390
- You guys ready?
- Yeah.

364
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:36,466
Where's George?

365
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:46,343
Kramer!

366
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:53,210
But I have to admit that I like flying.
I like those...

367
00:21:53,386 --> 00:21:56,253
...little bathrooms that
they have on the plane.

368
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:58,983
It's like a small apartment
of your own on the plane.

369
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,150
You go in, close the door,
the light comes on.

370
00:22:01,328 --> 00:22:03,796
It's like a surprise party
every time you go in there.

371
00:22:03,964 --> 00:22:06,296
But the worst way
of flying, I think, is standby.

372
00:22:06,466 --> 00:22:08,457
You ever fly standby?
It never works.

373
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:12,401
That's why they call it "standby." You
end up standing there going, "Bye.

374
00:22:12,772 --> 00:22:14,205
I didn't...

375
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,636
Yeah."

376
00:22:15,809 --> 00:22:17,936
I was on this plane
where the flight attendant...

377
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:21,638
It was her first day on the job. So
they didn't have a uniform for her yet.

378
00:22:21,815 --> 00:22:23,942
And that really makes
a big difference.

379
00:22:24,117 --> 00:22:26,449
Here's just some regular person
coming over, going:

380
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,020
"Would you bring
your seatback all the way up?"

381
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:31,623
"Who the hell are you?"

382
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:33,851
She says,
"I'm the flight attendant."

383
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:35,961
"Yeah, well,
then I'm the pilot, all right?

384
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:38,996
So why don't you sit down?
I'm about to bring her in."
