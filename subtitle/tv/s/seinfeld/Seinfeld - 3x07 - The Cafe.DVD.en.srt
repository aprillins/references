1
00:00:03,752 --> 00:00:06,402
There's always one location
in your neighborhood, one store...

2
00:00:06,567 --> 00:00:08,672
...that's constantly changing hands.

3
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:11,359
Everybody has this in their
neighborhood. let's a leather store...

4
00:00:11,527 --> 00:00:13,632
...then it's a yogurt shop,
it's a pet supply.

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,166
let's constantly changing.
Nobody can do business there.

6
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:18,629
let's like some sort of
Bermuda Triangle of retail.

7
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:22,882
Stores open up and then
they just disappear without a trace.

8
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:24,421
Nobody knows what happened.

9
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:28,706
Eventually, when aliens land and the
mothership from <i>Close Encounters</i>--

10
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:32,480
The bottom will slowly open and all
these store owners will wander out...

11
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:36,476
...in a daze, going, ''I thought there
was gonna be more walk-in traffic.''

12
00:00:39,302 --> 00:00:40,250
She thinks I'm nice.

13
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:43,909
-Women don't want nice.
-Amazing.

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,852
I haven't seen one person go in
that restaurant since it opened.

15
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:50,020
-Poor guy.
-Why is nice bad?

16
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:53,248
What kind of a sick society are
we living in when nice is bad?

17
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:55,104
What's that smell?
What are you wearing?

18
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:57,025
What? A little cologne.

19
00:00:57,412 --> 00:00:58,427
Manly.

20
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:00,897
-Monica wants me to wear it.
-Why didn't you say no?

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,304
I'm too nice.

22
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:05,534
Look at this poor guy. His family's
probably back in Pakistan waiting...

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,129
...for him to send back money.

24
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,210
This is horrible.

25
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:10,690
She wants me to take an IQ test.

26
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:13,307
let's because you're stupid enough
to wear the cologne.

27
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:17,410
No. She's taking this course
in education for her master's.

28
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:20,386
let's part of her research project,
so I have to be a guinea pig.

29
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,396
I've never been a guinea pig.
Been a sheep, been a toady....

30
00:01:24,132 --> 00:01:25,506
I can't talk to you anymore.

31
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,123
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
You're taking the IQ test.

32
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,884
She's gonna find out I'm a moron.

33
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:32,995
People think I'm smart,
but I'm not smart.

34
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:35,010
Who thinks you're smart?

35
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:36,764
I won't break 1 00 on this thing.

36
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,451
-What thing?
-You don't listen anymore.

37
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:41,474
Oh, the IQ thing. Yeah.

38
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:43,937
I'm sure I have a low IQ.

39
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:46,138
I've been lying about my SAT scores
for 1 5 years.

40
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:49,307
-What did you get?
-What did I get, or what do I say I got?

41
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:51,744
-What do you say?
-I say 1 40<i>9</i>.

42
00:01:51,938 --> 00:01:54,043
-1 40<i>9</i>, that's a good score.
-You're telling me.

43
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,770
What did you really get?

44
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:57,377
-You're my friend.
-Of course.

45
00:01:57,538 --> 00:01:59,326
-I tell you everything, right?
-I hope so.

46
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,392
Well, this I take to the grave.

47
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,275
He's serving Mexican,
Italian, Chinese.

48
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:07,959
He's all over the place.
That's why no one's going in.

49
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,985
Why do you keep watching?

50
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:12,284
I don't know. I'm obsessed with it.

51
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:17,312
let's like a spider in the toilet,
struggling for survival.

52
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:19,610
And even though you know
he's not gonna make it...

53
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:21,686
...you root for him for a second.

54
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:23,286
Then you flush.

55
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,681
Well, it's a spider.

56
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,658
Sometimes people
won't go in a place...

57
00:02:29,825 --> 00:02:32,280
...if they don't see anyone else
in there.

58
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:36,791
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't
do that. That is so annoying.

59
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:38,429
Bazooka Joe.

60
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:48,694
-The buzzer?
-let's your house.

61
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:52,726
My house. You gotta be on the lease
to press the buzzer.

62
00:02:53,728 --> 00:02:55,189
-Yeah?
-<i>It's George.

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,734
Come on up.

64
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,579
-<i>Casus belli.</i>
-What's that?

65
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:03,289
let's Latin. I read it in some book.
I just wanted to say it out loud.

66
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:04,765
Come on, go in.

67
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,873
Go in.

68
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:10,427
-Have you gone in there?
-No. I'm afraid we'll start talking...

69
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:12,926
...and I'll wind up going partners
with him.

70
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:15,157
Hey.

71
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:24,214
I could probably shoot him from here.
I'd be doing us both a favor.

72
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,772
I'm wearing some cologne,
all right?

73
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:32,925
Sure. Fine.

74
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:35,132
<i>Casus belli</i>.

75
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:38,741
<i>Casus belli</i>.

76
00:03:39,326 --> 00:03:41,977
-What's that?
-Since when do you wear cologne?

77
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:43,735
Why is what I do so important?

78
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:46,073
Why must I always be the focal point
of attention?

79
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:48,060
Let me just be. Let me live.

80
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:53,045
-How'd you do on that IQ test?
-I didn't take it yet.

81
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:54,872
-What IQ test?
-What's <i>casus belli</i>?

82
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:58,169
-Oh, it's nothing.
-Is it about me?

83
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:00,537
Why must you always be
the focal point of attention?

84
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:03,483
Why can't you just be?
Why can't you live?

85
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:09,243
let's just a Latin phrase. It does not
mean anything. Now, what is this test?

86
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:12,503
This woman he's dating is making him
take this IQ test for this course.

87
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,807
-Oh, that sounds like fun.
-Yeah, fun.

88
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:18,964
IQ tests are totally bogus.
They prove nothing.

89
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,980
-You'll do well. You're smart.
-No, see, he's not smart.

90
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,401
People think he's smart,
but he's not.

91
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:27,353
What did you get on your SATs?

92
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:29,654
It varies.

93
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:34,806
-I don't even know my IQ.
-Mine's 1 45.

94
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:38,201
-One forty-five!
-Get out of here.

95
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:40,567
-You get out of here.
-You get out of here.

96
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:44,016
Maybe you should
take the test for me.

97
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:47,253
That would be something,
cheating on an IQ test.

98
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:49,817
Remember in college when you
passed Lettick the test...

99
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,222
...out the window?

100
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:54,486
-You became a legend after that.
-Yeah.

101
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:57,400
Yeah, I really had some guts
back then.

102
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:01,363
-Why don't we do it again?
-What?

103
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:03,124
You could take the IQ test for me.

104
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,138
I'll pass it to you out of a window.
She lives on the first floor.

105
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:07,607
-You serious?
-Why not?

106
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,625
Where would I take the test?

107
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:12,600
She lives around the corner.
Take it here or go to the coffee shop.

108
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,769
-No, too noisy.
-Take it at the Dream Cafe.

109
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:16,148
You won't hear a peep.

110
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,144
-Hey, what do you think?
-Hey, I love a good caper.

111
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:26,805
Yeah, that's what it is, isn't it?
A caper.

112
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:28,463
You'll do it?

113
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:31,921
-What the hey.
-Yeah! Beautiful!

114
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:34,031
Sorry.

115
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:44,338
-Welcome to the Dream Cafe.
-Well, I've been looking forward to it.

116
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:46,643
How did you hear about us?

117
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:48,751
People. People are talking.

118
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:53,710
Smoking or nonsmoking?
We are proud to offer both.

119
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:55,953
-Nonsmoking would be great.
-Very good.

120
00:05:56,184 --> 00:05:59,762
My name is Babu Bhatt.
I will be your waiter.

121
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:02,674
A steaming hot, folded face cloth
for your pleasure.

122
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,687
-Thank you.
-Our specials are tacos...

123
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:07,888
...moussaka and franks and beans.

124
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:11,959
Well, what do you recommend,
my good fellow?

125
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:14,933
-The turkey.
-Well, the turkey it'll be.

126
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:17,648
May I say you have a splendid
establishment here, my friend.

127
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:20,815
I'm sure you'll flourish at this location
for many, many years.

128
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:23,121
You're a very kind man.
Very kind. Thank you.

129
00:06:23,735 --> 00:06:25,229
Very kind.

130
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:29,359
<i>Very kind. I am a kind man.

131
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:32,406
<i>Who else would do something</i>
<i>like this? Nobody.

132
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:34,898
<i>Nobody thinks about people</i>
<i>the way I do.

133
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:36,757
<i>Snap out of it, you stupid jerk.

134
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,307
<i>You're eating a turkey sandwich.</i>
<i>You want a Nobel Prize?

135
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,941
You go in the living room,
I'll take the test in here.

136
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,312
But why?

137
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,001
I won't be able to concentrate
in front of you.

138
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,996
I think you're making too much of this.
IQ tests don't mean anything.

139
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,508
Are you kidding me?

140
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:56,235
This is the best tool we have today
of measuring a person's intelligence.

141
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:58,958
Well, I certainly don't place
any importance on it.

142
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,230
Well, I think you're wrong
about that.

143
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:06,314
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd really like to get started, please.

144
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,532
-Good luck.
-Don't need it.

145
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:14,895
What's going on?
I've been here 20 minutes.

146
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:17,166
I'm sorry. Here's the test.
Thanks for doing this.

147
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,115
-What time do you want me back?
-Twenty to 3.

148
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:21,585
-Okay.
-Thanks again.

149
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,007
And don't settle for 1 45.
You can do better. You're a genius.

150
00:07:31,892 --> 00:07:33,932
Thank you, Babu.

151
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:38,894
You have quite a flair. You are
quite the restaurateur, I must say.

152
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,775
-It is indeed my pleasure.
-Oh, please.

153
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:45,618
Welcome to the Dream Cafe.

154
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:49,608
-Our specials today--
-Oh, no, no. I'll just have tea and toast.

155
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:53,779
-Tea and toast.
-Eat something! Babu.

156
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:56,429
Okay.

157
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:59,592
Well, I'll have the rigatoni.

158
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:03,243
Oh, very good choice.
Very good.

159
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:07,241
So you got the test. You're cheating.

160
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:09,644
I know.

161
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:12,208
-Hey.
-Hey.

162
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,493
Oh, boy.

163
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:20,269
Jerry, let me ask you something.

164
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,125
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hey.

165
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:26,160
This guy leaves this jacket
at my mother's house two years ago.

166
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:30,734
She hasn't spoken to him since and
now he says he wants the jacket back.

167
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:33,773
-So?
-Well, I'm not giving it back.

168
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:35,400
Why not?

169
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:39,213
Because I meet a lot of women in
this jacket. They're attracted to it.

170
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:41,711
Why do you think my mother
went out with him?

171
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:46,347
-You all right?
-Yeah. Okay.

172
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:48,335
What?

173
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,656
Anyway, it's been two years.

174
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:58,635
I mean, isn't there, like,
a statue of limitations on that?

175
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,389
Statute.

176
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:03,497
-What?
-Statute of limitations.

177
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:05,519
let's not a statue.

178
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,531
No, it's statue.

179
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,793
Fine. let's a sculpture of limitations.

180
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:14,863
Wait a minute. Just wait a minute.
Elaine. Elaine.

181
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:19,045
Now, you're smart. Is it ''statue''
or ''statute'' of limitations?

182
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:22,860
-Statute.
-Oh, I really think you're wrong.

183
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:27,112
Kramer, I have to take this test.
I don't have a lot of time.

184
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,674
What test?

185
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:33,927
-An IQ test.
-Why are you taking an IQ test?

186
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:36,233
-let's for George.
-George?

187
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:39,047
Look, can I explain it to you later?

188
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:41,189
But why are you taking
an IQ test for George?

189
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:42,635
Would you please?!

190
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:45,644
-Is it for a job or something?
-Later!

191
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:51,690
-You're positive it's statute?
-Yes! Yes!

192
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:54,662
Welcome, welcome.
A steaming hot face cloth--

193
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:08,908
-George?
-Yeah?

194
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:11,308
The door's locked.

195
00:10:11,469 --> 00:10:13,062
Oh, it's locked?

196
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:15,556
I need to get something.

197
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:19,081
Monica, I'm really focused here.
This stuff's a killer.

198
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:22,022
-George!
-Wish I could.

199
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:32,972
Babu!

200
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:35,684
lf you don't mind....
Okay.

201
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:39,562
-I'll get this.
-Oh, my God! let's all over the test!

202
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:43,302
-I'm terribly sorry.
-Oh, man!

203
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,956
-I'm out of time, anyway.
-Please forgive me. Please.

204
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:47,912
Go ahead. I'll take care of it.

205
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:50,786
Please, I'm very sorry.

206
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:53,257
Tell your friends.

207
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:04,963
let's all right.
She was cheating anyway.

208
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:08,259
You're a very kind man.

209
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:10,152
Babu....

210
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:14,633
-You're Pakistani, right?
-Yes, Pakistani. Yes.

211
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:17,793
Babu, may I say something?

212
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:20,231
Of course. You're very smart man.
I listen.

213
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:24,584
I am not a restaurateur by any means,
but it occurred to me that perhaps...

214
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:27,561
...you might serve some dishes
from your native Pakistan...

215
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:30,624
...as opposed to, say,
the franks and beans, for example.

216
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:33,761
-There are no Pakistani people here.
-It doesn't matter.

217
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,028
You would have the only authentic
Pakistani restaurant...

218
00:11:37,226 --> 00:11:38,632
...in the whole neighborhood.

219
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,028
Yes.

220
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:44,515
You see everything, don't you?

221
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:48,862
Well, you know, not everything.
I do what I can.

222
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:54,883
I close down today. And when I open
again, it will be a Pakistani restaurant.

223
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:58,914
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You're a very special person.

224
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,542
Very special.

225
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,616
<i>I am such a great guy.

226
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,425
<i>Who else would've gone to the</i>
<i>trouble to help this immigrant?

227
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:11,103
<i>I am special. My mother was right.

228
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:15,711
<i>Of course, I've never had</i>
<i>Pakistani food. How bad could it be?

229
00:12:19,943 --> 00:12:24,002
-It was an accident.
-What, did you go on a picnic?

230
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:26,599
Babu Bhatt did it.

231
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:30,749
Babu Bhatt?

232
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:34,333
-How am I going to explain this?
-Time's up, George.

233
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:37,637
Okay.

234
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:45,219
-Here you go.
-How did you do?

235
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:48,317
-Piece of cake.
-What happened to the test?

236
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:51,138
What? Oh, I spilled some food on it.

237
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:55,039
Food? What food?

238
00:12:55,462 --> 00:12:56,738
What are you talking about?

239
00:12:57,382 --> 00:12:58,592
Where did you get food?

240
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:01,122
-From my pocket.
-Your pocket?

241
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:05,599
I had a sandwich in my pocket.

242
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,788
-And coffee?
-Yeah. Had some coffee, yeah.

243
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:14,625
-Where did you get the coffee?
-Where did I get the coffee?

244
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:17,439
Where do you think I got the coffee?
At the grocery store.

245
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:19,771
-How did you get there?
-I walked.

246
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:22,878
How did you get out?
I didn't see you leave.

247
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:26,558
-I climbed out the window.
-You climbed out the window?

248
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:29,343
-Of course.
-Why didn't you go out the door?

249
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:31,326
The door?

250
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:36,542
Why would I go out the door?
The window's right here.

251
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:41,919
You're a fascinating man,
George Costanza.

252
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,677
The average person sees a situation
like this...

253
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:49,690
...they walk right by it.

254
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:53,466
-Not me.
-You're very special.

255
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:56,960
Hey, do me a favor.

256
00:13:57,124 --> 00:14:00,320
Some guy comes looking for me,
tell him you don't know where I am.

257
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:02,491
Of course. I always do.

258
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:06,332
No, no, it's that guy. He's really
been bugging me about the jacket.

259
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,954
-Just give it back to him.
-He'll have to kill me.

260
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:17,501
-Hey, Georgie!
-I'm coming up.

261
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,152
How did you do on the IQ test?

262
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:22,012
Eighty-five!

263
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:29,919
-What?
-Eighty-five, Jerry! 85 IQ.

264
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:33,440
Eighty-five?

265
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:36,351
Well, well, well....

266
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:38,591
He's coming up?

267
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:40,312
Well, I'm no genius...

268
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:45,150
...but according to my calculations,
he should be here in a few seconds.

269
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:48,697
Yeah, but an 85?
Jerry, that's ridiculous.

270
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:51,102
Well, maybe the test
was gender-biased.

271
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,112
You know, a lot of questions
on hunting and testicles.

272
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:03,067
Oh, hello, professor.

273
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:08,792
-George, I cannot believe--
-Please.

274
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:13,215
-No, there's gotta be a mistake.
-You should have seen her face.

275
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:15,162
It was the same look
my father gave me...

276
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:18,045
...when I told him I wanted
to be a ventriloquist.

277
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:22,550
But an 85?

278
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:24,824
Listen, there were too many
distractions there.

279
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:30,010
Babu whatever his name was.
And Kramer. I couldn't concentrate.

280
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:32,761
It was a madhouse.

281
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:35,100
Jerry, it was.

282
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:37,653
-Let me take it again.
-Forget it.

283
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:40,791
Oh, come on. Come on.
I'll guarantee you 1 40.

284
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,934
-What do you have to lose?
-You could do worse!

285
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,070
No. No, come on. I guarantee it.

286
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:50,493
-All right, I'll ask her.
-Okay. Now, where am I gonna take it?

287
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:54,451
Take it here. I'll leave.
There'll be no distractions.

288
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:04,637
Well, congratulations, my friend.

289
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,059
Sorry I missed the grand reopening.
I was out of town for about a week.

290
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:10,486
You see how I listen?

291
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,467
I work very hard,
borrow more money.

292
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:17,693
I think it's fantastic. It has
a certain indefinable charm.

293
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,744
-You wish to eat?
-Let me tell you something, Babu.

294
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,292
You go back in that kitchen,
tell your chef I want the works.

295
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,343
Very good.

296
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:32,956
<i>Very good?

297
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,612
<i>No, not very good...

298
00:16:34,781 --> 00:16:36,210
<i>...very great.

299
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:39,479
<i>I am very, very great.

300
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:53,619
The IQ tests always have that
sample question at the beginning...

301
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:56,154
...where they show you how
to fill in the circle.

302
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:59,515
This should be the first
elimination point right there.

303
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:01,137
Anybody goes outside that circle:

304
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:04,504
''You wanna come with us, please?
Yeah, you're done. Your test is over.

305
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:07,220
You went outside the circle, okay?''

306
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,424
-What are you doing?
-Quiet. Don't say anything.

307
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:26,263
-What's going on?
-Hey, Kramer! I saw you go in there!

308
00:17:26,426 --> 00:17:29,012
I'm not leaving till you
give me that jacket!

309
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:32,085
-Open up, Kramer!
-What did you come in here for?

310
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,120
Well, I thought I'd throw him off.
See, he knows where I live.

311
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:38,964
Look, Kramer, I have to return
this test. I've gotta get out of here.

312
00:17:39,386 --> 00:17:42,233
-I thought you took the test.
-I had to take it again.

313
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,728
-How come?
-What's the difference?!

314
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,741
-Well, you can't leave now.
-What?

315
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:49,295
Come on, Kramer,
I want that jacket back!

316
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:51,833
Never!

317
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,948
Come on, George, open up.

318
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:07,639
-Well?
-How you doing?

319
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:10,995
Where's the test?

320
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:13,677
You know, it's the damnedest thing.

321
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:16,783
I went out the window again
to get a cup of coffee....

322
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,847
Babu....

323
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:27,502
Babu.

324
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,973
Babu...

325
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,542
...you know, I've gotta tell you,
I never do this, but the shrimp...

326
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:40,493
...it's just a little stringy.

327
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:44,465
-You have any chicken?
-The shrimp is stringy?

328
00:18:44,632 --> 00:18:46,901
-Well, maybe you refrigerated--
-Quiet!

329
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:49,747
-No, l--
-You shut up!

330
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:53,075
You make me change restaurant,
but nobody come!

331
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:57,101
You say make Pakistani. Babu Bhatt
have only Pakistani restaurant.

332
00:18:57,591 --> 00:19:01,300
But where are people? You see
people? Show me people!

333
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:03,023
There are no people!

334
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:06,292
-I think I'll just take the check.
-You bad man!

335
00:19:06,455 --> 00:19:08,724
You very, very bad man.

336
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:14,133
<i>Bad man? Could my mother</i>
<i>have been wrong?

337
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,739
Are you looking for George?

338
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:27,729
Well....

339
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,776
Kind of.

340
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:32,239
George left.

341
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:36,274
Is that the test?

342
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,698
This?

343
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,352
Yeah.

344
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,260
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

345
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,678
I hope you do a lot better this time.

346
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:54,322
Actually, I think I did.

347
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:59,274
The first time,
I couldn't really concentrate.

348
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:08,971
You know what it was?
Bad location.

349
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,369
Come on, let's not stand here
too long. We might run into her.

350
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:14,897
Aren't you cold?
Where's your jacket?

351
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:19,087
-Oh, sorry.
-I'm going upstairs.

352
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:24,905
Hey, guys. I just ran into Monica.
You know what my IQ is?

353
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:28,080
One fifty-one.

354
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:30,447
-One fifty-one?
-Yeah.

355
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:33,737
That's a good score.

356
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:35,944
So, what are you up for?
How about Mexican?

357
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:38,384
-Italian.
-No, Chinese.

358
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,657
You know what would be great?

359
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,035
let's tough to do a good deed. Let's look
at your professional good-deed doers:

360
00:20:57,202 --> 00:20:59,274
Your Lone Rangers, your Supermen...

361
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:02,505
...your Batmen, your Spider-Men,
your Elastic Men.

362
00:21:03,154 --> 00:21:06,601
They're all wearing disguises. Masks
over their faces, secret identities.

363
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:11,209
Don't want people to know
who they are. Too much aggravation.

364
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:13,611
''Superman,
thanks for saving my life...

365
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:16,428
...but did you have
to come through my wall?

366
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:21,737
I'm renting here. They got a security
deposit. What am I supposed to do?''

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
1
00:00:03,752 --> 00:00:06,402
There's always one location
in your neighborhood, one store...

2
00:00:06,567 --> 00:00:08,672
...that's constantly changing hands.

3
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:11,359
Everybody has this in their
neighborhood. let's a leather store...

4
00:00:11,527 --> 00:00:13,632
...then it's a yogurt shop,
it's a pet supply.

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,166
let's constantly changing.
Nobody can do business there.

6
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:18,629
let's like some sort of
Bermuda Triangle of retail.

7
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:22,882
Stores open up and then
they just disappear without a trace.

8
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:24,421
Nobody knows what happened.

9
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:28,706
Eventually, when aliens land and the
mothership from <i>Close Encounters</i>--

10
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:32,480
The bottom will slowly open and all
these store owners will wander out...

11
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:36,476
...in a daze, going, ''I thought there
was gonna be more walk-in traffic.''

12
00:00:39,302 --> 00:00:40,250
She thinks I'm nice.

13
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:43,909
-Women don't want nice.
-Amazing.

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,852
I haven't seen one person go in
that restaurant since it opened.

15
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:50,020
-Poor guy.
-Why is nice bad?

16
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:53,248
What kind of a sick society are
we living in when nice is bad?

17
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:55,104
What's that smell?
What are you wearing?

18
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:57,025
What? A little cologne.

19
00:00:57,412 --> 00:00:58,427
Manly.

20
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:00,897
-Monica wants me to wear it.
-Why didn't you say no?

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,304
I'm too nice.

22
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:05,534
Look at this poor guy. His family's
probably back in Pakistan waiting...

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,129
...for him to send back money.

24
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,210
This is horrible.

25
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:10,690
She wants me to take an IQ test.

26
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:13,307
let's because you're stupid enough
to wear the cologne.

27
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:17,410
No. She's taking this course
in education for her master's.

28
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:20,386
let's part of her research project,
so I have to be a guinea pig.

29
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,396
I've never been a guinea pig.
Been a sheep, been a toady....

30
00:01:24,132 --> 00:01:25,506
I can't talk to you anymore.

31
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,123
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
You're taking the IQ test.

32
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,884
She's gonna find out I'm a moron.

33
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:32,995
People think I'm smart,
but I'm not smart.

34
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:35,010
Who thinks you're smart?

35
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:36,764
I won't break 1 00 on this thing.

36
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,451
-What thing?
-You don't listen anymore.

37
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:41,474
Oh, the IQ thing. Yeah.

38
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:43,937
I'm sure I have a low IQ.

39
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:46,138
I've been lying about my SAT scores
for 1 5 years.

40
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:49,307
-What did you get?
-What did I get, or what do I say I got?

41
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:51,744
-What do you say?
-I say 1 40<i>9</i>.

42
00:01:51,938 --> 00:01:54,043
-1 40<i>9</i>, that's a good score.
-You're telling me.

43
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,770
What did you really get?

44
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:57,377
-You're my friend.
-Of course.

45
00:01:57,538 --> 00:01:59,326
-I tell you everything, right?
-I hope so.

46
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,392
Well, this I take to the grave.

47
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,275
He's serving Mexican,
Italian, Chinese.

48
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:07,959
He's all over the place.
That's why no one's going in.

49
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,985
Why do you keep watching?

50
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:12,284
I don't know. I'm obsessed with it.

51
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:17,312
let's like a spider in the toilet,
struggling for survival.

52
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:19,610
And even though you know
he's not gonna make it...

53
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:21,686
...you root for him for a second.

54
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:23,286
Then you flush.

55
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,681
Well, it's a spider.

56
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,658
Sometimes people
won't go in a place...

57
00:02:29,825 --> 00:02:32,280
...if they don't see anyone else
in there.

58
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:36,791
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't
do that. That is so annoying.

59
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:38,429
Bazooka Joe.

60
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:48,694
-The buzzer?
-let's your house.

61
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:52,726
My house. You gotta be on the lease
to press the buzzer.

62
00:02:53,728 --> 00:02:55,189
-Yeah?
-<i>It's George.

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,734
Come on up.

64
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,579
-<i>Casus belli.</i>
-What's that?

65
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:03,289
let's Latin. I read it in some book.
I just wanted to say it out loud.

66
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:04,765
Come on, go in.

67
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,873
Go in.

68
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:10,427
-Have you gone in there?
-No. I'm afraid we'll start talking...

69
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:12,926
...and I'll wind up going partners
with him.

70
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:15,157
Hey.

71
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:24,214
I could probably shoot him from here.
I'd be doing us both a favor.

72
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,772
I'm wearing some cologne,
all right?

73
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:32,925
Sure. Fine.

74
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:35,132
<i>Casus belli</i>.

75
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:38,741
<i>Casus belli</i>.

76
00:03:39,326 --> 00:03:41,977
-What's that?
-Since when do you wear cologne?

77
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:43,735
Why is what I do so important?

78
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:46,073
Why must I always be the focal point
of attention?

79
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:48,060
Let me just be. Let me live.

80
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:53,045
-How'd you do on that IQ test?
-I didn't take it yet.

81
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:54,872
-What IQ test?
-What's <i>casus belli</i>?

82
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:58,169
-Oh, it's nothing.
-Is it about me?

83
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:00,537
Why must you always be
the focal point of attention?

84
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:03,483
Why can't you just be?
Why can't you live?

85
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:09,243
let's just a Latin phrase. It does not
mean anything. Now, what is this test?

86
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:12,503
This woman he's dating is making him
take this IQ test for this course.

87
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,807
-Oh, that sounds like fun.
-Yeah, fun.

88
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:18,964
IQ tests are totally bogus.
They prove nothing.

89
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,980
-You'll do well. You're smart.
-No, see, he's not smart.

90
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,401
People think he's smart,
but he's not.

91
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:27,353
What did you get on your SATs?

92
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:29,654
It varies.

93
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:34,806
-I don't even know my IQ.
-Mine's 1 45.

94
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:38,201
-One forty-five!
-Get out of here.

95
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:40,567
-You get out of here.
-You get out of here.

96
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:44,016
Maybe you should
take the test for me.

97
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:47,253
That would be something,
cheating on an IQ test.

98
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:49,817
Remember in college when you
passed Lettick the test...

99
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,222
...out the window?

100
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:54,486
-You became a legend after that.
-Yeah.

101
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:57,400
Yeah, I really had some guts
back then.

102
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:01,363
-Why don't we do it again?
-What?

103
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:03,124
You could take the IQ test for me.

104
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,138
I'll pass it to you out of a window.
She lives on the first floor.

105
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:07,607
-You serious?
-Why not?

106
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,625
Where would I take the test?

107
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:12,600
She lives around the corner.
Take it here or go to the coffee shop.

108
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,769
-No, too noisy.
-Take it at the Dream Cafe.

109
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:16,148
You won't hear a peep.

110
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,144
-Hey, what do you think?
-Hey, I love a good caper.

111
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:26,805
Yeah, that's what it is, isn't it?
A caper.

112
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:28,463
You'll do it?

113
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:31,921
-What the hey.
-Yeah! Beautiful!

114
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:34,031
Sorry.

115
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:44,338
-Welcome to the Dream Cafe.
-Well, I've been looking forward to it.

116
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:46,643
How did you hear about us?

117
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:48,751
People. People are talking.

118
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:53,710
Smoking or nonsmoking?
We are proud to offer both.

119
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:55,953
-Nonsmoking would be great.
-Very good.

120
00:05:56,184 --> 00:05:59,762
My name is Babu Bhatt.
I will be your waiter.

121
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:02,674
A steaming hot, folded face cloth
for your pleasure.

122
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,687
-Thank you.
-Our specials are tacos...

123
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:07,888
...moussaka and franks and beans.

124
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:11,959
Well, what do you recommend,
my good fellow?

125
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:14,933
-The turkey.
-Well, the turkey it'll be.

126
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:17,648
May I say you have a splendid
establishment here, my friend.

127
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:20,815
I'm sure you'll flourish at this location
for many, many years.

128
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:23,121
You're a very kind man.
Very kind. Thank you.

129
00:06:23,735 --> 00:06:25,229
Very kind.

130
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:29,359
<i>Very kind. I am a kind man.

131
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:32,406
<i>Who else would do something</i>
<i>like this? Nobody.

132
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:34,898
<i>Nobody thinks about people</i>
<i>the way I do.

133
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:36,757
<i>Snap out of it, you stupid jerk.

134
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,307
<i>You're eating a turkey sandwich.</i>
<i>You want a Nobel Prize?

135
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,941
You go in the living room,
I'll take the test in here.

136
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,312
But why?

137
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,001
I won't be able to concentrate
in front of you.

138
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,996
I think you're making too much of this.
IQ tests don't mean anything.

139
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,508
Are you kidding me?

140
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:56,235
This is the best tool we have today
of measuring a person's intelligence.

141
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:58,958
Well, I certainly don't place
any importance on it.

142
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,230
Well, I think you're wrong
about that.

143
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:06,314
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd really like to get started, please.

144
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,532
-Good luck.
-Don't need it.

145
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:14,895
What's going on?
I've been here 20 minutes.

146
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:17,166
I'm sorry. Here's the test.
Thanks for doing this.

147
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,115
-What time do you want me back?
-Twenty to 3.

148
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:21,585
-Okay.
-Thanks again.

149
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,007
And don't settle for 1 45.
You can do better. You're a genius.

150
00:07:31,892 --> 00:07:33,932
Thank you, Babu.

151
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:38,894
You have quite a flair. You are
quite the restaurateur, I must say.

152
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,775
-It is indeed my pleasure.
-Oh, please.

153
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:45,618
Welcome to the Dream Cafe.

154
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:49,608
-Our specials today--
-Oh, no, no. I'll just have tea and toast.

155
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:53,779
-Tea and toast.
-Eat something! Babu.

156
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:56,429
Okay.

157
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:59,592
Well, I'll have the rigatoni.

158
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:03,243
Oh, very good choice.
Very good.

159
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:07,241
So you got the test. You're cheating.

160
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:09,644
I know.

161
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:12,208
-Hey.
-Hey.

162
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,493
Oh, boy.

163
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:20,269
Jerry, let me ask you something.

164
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,125
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hey.

165
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:26,160
This guy leaves this jacket
at my mother's house two years ago.

166
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:30,734
She hasn't spoken to him since and
now he says he wants the jacket back.

167
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:33,773
-So?
-Well, I'm not giving it back.

168
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:35,400
Why not?

169
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:39,213
Because I meet a lot of women in
this jacket. They're attracted to it.

170
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:41,711
Why do you think my mother
went out with him?

171
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:46,347
-You all right?
-Yeah. Okay.

172
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:48,335
What?

173
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,656
Anyway, it's been two years.

174
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:58,635
I mean, isn't there, like,
a statue of limitations on that?

175
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,389
Statute.

176
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:03,497
-What?
-Statute of limitations.

177
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:05,519
let's not a statue.

178
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,531
No, it's statue.

179
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,793
Fine. let's a sculpture of limitations.

180
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:14,863
Wait a minute. Just wait a minute.
Elaine. Elaine.

181
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:19,045
Now, you're smart. Is it ''statue''
or ''statute'' of limitations?

182
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:22,860
-Statute.
-Oh, I really think you're wrong.

183
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:27,112
Kramer, I have to take this test.
I don't have a lot of time.

184
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,674
What test?

185
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:33,927
-An IQ test.
-Why are you taking an IQ test?

186
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:36,233
-let's for George.
-George?

187
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:39,047
Look, can I explain it to you later?

188
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:41,189
But why are you taking
an IQ test for George?

189
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:42,635
Would you please?!

190
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:45,644
-Is it for a job or something?
-Later!

191
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:51,690
-You're positive it's statute?
-Yes! Yes!

192
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:54,662
Welcome, welcome.
A steaming hot face cloth--

193
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:08,908
-George?
-Yeah?

194
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:11,308
The door's locked.

195
00:10:11,469 --> 00:10:13,062
Oh, it's locked?

196
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:15,556
I need to get something.

197
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:19,081
Monica, I'm really focused here.
This stuff's a killer.

198
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:22,022
-George!
-Wish I could.

199
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:32,972
Babu!

200
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:35,684
lf you don't mind....
Okay.

201
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:39,562
-I'll get this.
-Oh, my God! let's all over the test!

202
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:43,302
-I'm terribly sorry.
-Oh, man!

203
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,956
-I'm out of time, anyway.
-Please forgive me. Please.

204
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:47,912
Go ahead. I'll take care of it.

205
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:50,786
Please, I'm very sorry.

206
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:53,257
Tell your friends.

207
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:04,963
let's all right.
She was cheating anyway.

208
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:08,259
You're a very kind man.

209
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:10,152
Babu....

210
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:14,633
-You're Pakistani, right?
-Yes, Pakistani. Yes.

211
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:17,793
Babu, may I say something?

212
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:20,231
Of course. You're very smart man.
I listen.

213
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:24,584
I am not a restaurateur by any means,
but it occurred to me that perhaps...

214
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:27,561
...you might serve some dishes
from your native Pakistan...

215
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:30,624
...as opposed to, say,
the franks and beans, for example.

216
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:33,761
-There are no Pakistani people here.
-It doesn't matter.

217
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,028
You would have the only authentic
Pakistani restaurant...

218
00:11:37,226 --> 00:11:38,632
...in the whole neighborhood.

219
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,028
Yes.

220
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:44,515
You see everything, don't you?

221
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:48,862
Well, you know, not everything.
I do what I can.

222
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:54,883
I close down today. And when I open
again, it will be a Pakistani restaurant.

223
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:58,914
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You're a very special person.

224
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,542
Very special.

225
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,616
<i>I am such a great guy.

226
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,425
<i>Who else would've gone to the</i>
<i>trouble to help this immigrant?

227
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:11,103
<i>I am special. My mother was right.

228
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:15,711
<i>Of course, I've never had</i>
<i>Pakistani food. How bad could it be?

229
00:12:19,943 --> 00:12:24,002
-It was an accident.
-What, did you go on a picnic?

230
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:26,599
Babu Bhatt did it.

231
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:30,749
Babu Bhatt?

232
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:34,333
-How am I going to explain this?
-Time's up, George.

233
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:37,637
Okay.

234
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:45,219
-Here you go.
-How did you do?

235
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:48,317
-Piece of cake.
-What happened to the test?

236
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:51,138
What? Oh, I spilled some food on it.

237
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:55,039
Food? What food?

238
00:12:55,462 --> 00:12:56,738
What are you talking about?

239
00:12:57,382 --> 00:12:58,592
Where did you get food?

240
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:01,122
-From my pocket.
-Your pocket?

241
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:05,599
I had a sandwich in my pocket.

242
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,788
-And coffee?
-Yeah. Had some coffee, yeah.

243
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:14,625
-Where did you get the coffee?
-Where did I get the coffee?

244
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:17,439
Where do you think I got the coffee?
At the grocery store.

245
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:19,771
-How did you get there?
-I walked.

246
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:22,878
How did you get out?
I didn't see you leave.

247
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:26,558
-I climbed out the window.
-You climbed out the window?

248
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:29,343
-Of course.
-Why didn't you go out the door?

249
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:31,326
The door?

250
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:36,542
Why would I go out the door?
The window's right here.

251
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:41,919
You're a fascinating man,
George Costanza.

252
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,677
The average person sees a situation
like this...

253
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:49,690
...they walk right by it.

254
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:53,466
-Not me.
-You're very special.

255
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:56,960
Hey, do me a favor.

256
00:13:57,124 --> 00:14:00,320
Some guy comes looking for me,
tell him you don't know where I am.

257
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:02,491
Of course. I always do.

258
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:06,332
No, no, it's that guy. He's really
been bugging me about the jacket.

259
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,954
-Just give it back to him.
-He'll have to kill me.

260
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:17,501
-Hey, Georgie!
-I'm coming up.

261
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,152
How did you do on the IQ test?

262
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:22,012
Eighty-five!

263
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:29,919
-What?
-Eighty-five, Jerry! 85 IQ.

264
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:33,440
Eighty-five?

265
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:36,351
Well, well, well....

266
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:38,591
He's coming up?

267
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:40,312
Well, I'm no genius...

268
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:45,150
...but according to my calculations,
he should be here in a few seconds.

269
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:48,697
Yeah, but an 85?
Jerry, that's ridiculous.

270
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:51,102
Well, maybe the test
was gender-biased.

271
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,112
You know, a lot of questions
on hunting and testicles.

272
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:03,067
Oh, hello, professor.

273
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:08,792
-George, I cannot believe--
-Please.

274
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:13,215
-No, there's gotta be a mistake.
-You should have seen her face.

275
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:15,162
It was the same look
my father gave me...

276
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:18,045
...when I told him I wanted
to be a ventriloquist.

277
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:22,550
But an 85?

278
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:24,824
Listen, there were too many
distractions there.

279
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:30,010
Babu whatever his name was.
And Kramer. I couldn't concentrate.

280
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:32,761
It was a madhouse.

281
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:35,100
Jerry, it was.

282
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:37,653
-Let me take it again.
-Forget it.

283
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:40,791
Oh, come on. Come on.
I'll guarantee you 1 40.

284
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,934
-What do you have to lose?
-You could do worse!

285
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,070
No. No, come on. I guarantee it.

286
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:50,493
-All right, I'll ask her.
-Okay. Now, where am I gonna take it?

287
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:54,451
Take it here. I'll leave.
There'll be no distractions.

288
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:04,637
Well, congratulations, my friend.

289
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,059
Sorry I missed the grand reopening.
I was out of town for about a week.

290
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:10,486
You see how I listen?

291
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,467
I work very hard,
borrow more money.

292
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:17,693
I think it's fantastic. It has
a certain indefinable charm.

293
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,744
-You wish to eat?
-Let me tell you something, Babu.

294
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,292
You go back in that kitchen,
tell your chef I want the works.

295
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,343
Very good.

296
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:32,956
<i>Very good?

297
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,612
<i>No, not very good...

298
00:16:34,781 --> 00:16:36,210
<i>...very great.

299
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:39,479
<i>I am very, very great.

300
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:53,619
The IQ tests always have that
sample question at the beginning...

301
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:56,154
...where they show you how
to fill in the circle.

302
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:59,515
This should be the first
elimination point right there.

303
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:01,137
Anybody goes outside that circle:

304
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:04,504
''You wanna come with us, please?
Yeah, you're done. Your test is over.

305
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:07,220
You went outside the circle, okay?''

306
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,424
-What are you doing?
-Quiet. Don't say anything.

307
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:26,263
-What's going on?
-Hey, Kramer! I saw you go in there!

308
00:17:26,426 --> 00:17:29,012
I'm not leaving till you
give me that jacket!

309
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:32,085
-Open up, Kramer!
-What did you come in here for?

310
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,120
Well, I thought I'd throw him off.
See, he knows where I live.

311
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:38,964
Look, Kramer, I have to return
this test. I've gotta get out of here.

312
00:17:39,386 --> 00:17:42,233
-I thought you took the test.
-I had to take it again.

313
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,728
-How come?
-What's the difference?!

314
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,741
-Well, you can't leave now.
-What?

315
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:49,295
Come on, Kramer,
I want that jacket back!

316
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:51,833
Never!

317
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,948
Come on, George, open up.

318
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:07,639
-Well?
-How you doing?

319
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:10,995
Where's the test?

320
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:13,677
You know, it's the damnedest thing.

321
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:16,783
I went out the window again
to get a cup of coffee....

322
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,847
Babu....

323
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:27,502
Babu.

324
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,973
Babu...

325
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,542
...you know, I've gotta tell you,
I never do this, but the shrimp...

326
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:40,493
...it's just a little stringy.

327
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:44,465
-You have any chicken?
-The shrimp is stringy?

328
00:18:44,632 --> 00:18:46,901
-Well, maybe you refrigerated--
-Quiet!

329
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:49,747
-No, l--
-You shut up!

330
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:53,075
You make me change restaurant,
but nobody come!

331
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:57,101
You say make Pakistani. Babu Bhatt
have only Pakistani restaurant.

332
00:18:57,591 --> 00:19:01,300
But where are people? You see
people? Show me people!

333
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:03,023
There are no people!

334
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:06,292
-I think I'll just take the check.
-You bad man!

335
00:19:06,455 --> 00:19:08,724
You very, very bad man.

336
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:14,133
<i>Bad man? Could my mother</i>
<i>have been wrong?

337
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,739
Are you looking for George?

338
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:27,729
Well....

339
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,776
Kind of.

340
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:32,239
George left.

341
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:36,274
Is that the test?

342
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,698
This?

343
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,352
Yeah.

344
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,260
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

345
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,678
I hope you do a lot better this time.

346
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:54,322
Actually, I think I did.

347
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:59,274
The first time,
I couldn't really concentrate.

348
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:08,971
You know what it was?
Bad location.

349
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,369
Come on, let's not stand here
too long. We might run into her.

350
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:14,897
Aren't you cold?
Where's your jacket?

351
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:19,087
-Oh, sorry.
-I'm going upstairs.

352
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:24,905
Hey, guys. I just ran into Monica.
You know what my IQ is?

353
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:28,080
One fifty-one.

354
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:30,447
-One fifty-one?
-Yeah.

355
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:33,737
That's a good score.

356
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:35,944
So, what are you up for?
How about Mexican?

357
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:38,384
-Italian.
-No, Chinese.

358
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,657
You know what would be great?

359
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,035
let's tough to do a good deed. Let's look
at your professional good-deed doers:

360
00:20:57,202 --> 00:20:59,274
Your Lone Rangers, your Supermen...

361
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:02,505
...your Batmen, your Spider-Men,
your Elastic Men.

362
00:21:03,154 --> 00:21:06,601
They're all wearing disguises. Masks
over their faces, secret identities.

363
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:11,209
Don't want people to know
who they are. Too much aggravation.

364
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:13,611
''Superman,
thanks for saving my life...

365
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:16,428
...but did you have
to come through my wall?

366
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:21,737
I'm renting here. They got a security
deposit. What am I supposed to do?''

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
1
00:00:03,752 --> 00:00:06,402
There's always one location
in your neighborhood, one store...

2
00:00:06,567 --> 00:00:08,672
...that's constantly changing hands.

3
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:11,359
Everybody has this in their
neighborhood. let's a leather store...

4
00:00:11,527 --> 00:00:13,632
...then it's a yogurt shop,
it's a pet supply.

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,166
let's constantly changing.
Nobody can do business there.

6
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:18,629
let's like some sort of
Bermuda Triangle of retail.

7
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:22,882
Stores open up and then
they just disappear without a trace.

8
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:24,421
Nobody knows what happened.

9
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:28,706
Eventually, when aliens land and the
mothership from <i>Close Encounters</i>--

10
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:32,480
The bottom will slowly open and all
these store owners will wander out...

11
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:36,476
...in a daze, going, ''I thought there
was gonna be more walk-in traffic.''

12
00:00:39,302 --> 00:00:40,250
She thinks I'm nice.

13
00:00:42,502 --> 00:00:43,909
-Women don't want nice.
-Amazing.

14
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:46,852
I haven't seen one person go in
that restaurant since it opened.

15
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:50,020
-Poor guy.
-Why is nice bad?

16
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:53,248
What kind of a sick society are
we living in when nice is bad?

17
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:55,104
What's that smell?
What are you wearing?

18
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:57,025
What? A little cologne.

19
00:00:57,412 --> 00:00:58,427
Manly.

20
00:00:58,628 --> 00:01:00,897
-Monica wants me to wear it.
-Why didn't you say no?

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,304
I'm too nice.

22
00:01:02,468 --> 00:01:05,534
Look at this poor guy. His family's
probably back in Pakistan waiting...

23
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,129
...for him to send back money.

24
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,210
This is horrible.

25
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:10,690
She wants me to take an IQ test.

26
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:13,307
let's because you're stupid enough
to wear the cologne.

27
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:17,410
No. She's taking this course
in education for her master's.

28
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:20,386
let's part of her research project,
so I have to be a guinea pig.

29
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:23,396
I've never been a guinea pig.
Been a sheep, been a toady....

30
00:01:24,132 --> 00:01:25,506
I can't talk to you anymore.

31
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:28,123
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
You're taking the IQ test.

32
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,884
She's gonna find out I'm a moron.

33
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:32,995
People think I'm smart,
but I'm not smart.

34
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:35,010
Who thinks you're smart?

35
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:36,764
I won't break 1 00 on this thing.

36
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,451
-What thing?
-You don't listen anymore.

37
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:41,474
Oh, the IQ thing. Yeah.

38
00:01:42,115 --> 00:01:43,937
I'm sure I have a low IQ.

39
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:46,138
I've been lying about my SAT scores
for 1 5 years.

40
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:49,307
-What did you get?
-What did I get, or what do I say I got?

41
00:01:49,475 --> 00:01:51,744
-What do you say?
-I say 1 40<i>9</i>.

42
00:01:51,938 --> 00:01:54,043
-1 40<i>9</i>, that's a good score.
-You're telling me.

43
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,770
What did you really get?

44
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:57,377
-You're my friend.
-Of course.

45
00:01:57,538 --> 00:01:59,326
-I tell you everything, right?
-I hope so.

46
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,392
Well, this I take to the grave.

47
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,275
He's serving Mexican,
Italian, Chinese.

48
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:07,959
He's all over the place.
That's why no one's going in.

49
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,985
Why do you keep watching?

50
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:12,284
I don't know. I'm obsessed with it.

51
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:17,312
let's like a spider in the toilet,
struggling for survival.

52
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:19,610
And even though you know
he's not gonna make it...

53
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:21,686
...you root for him for a second.

54
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:23,286
Then you flush.

55
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,681
Well, it's a spider.

56
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,658
Sometimes people
won't go in a place...

57
00:02:29,825 --> 00:02:32,280
...if they don't see anyone else
in there.

58
00:02:32,448 --> 00:02:36,791
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't
do that. That is so annoying.

59
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:38,429
Bazooka Joe.

60
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:48,694
-The buzzer?
-let's your house.

61
00:02:49,344 --> 00:02:52,726
My house. You gotta be on the lease
to press the buzzer.

62
00:02:53,728 --> 00:02:55,189
-Yeah?
-<i>It's George.

63
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,734
Come on up.

64
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,579
-<i>Casus belli.</i>
-What's that?

65
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:03,289
let's Latin. I read it in some book.
I just wanted to say it out loud.

66
00:03:03,456 --> 00:03:04,765
Come on, go in.

67
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,873
Go in.

68
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:10,427
-Have you gone in there?
-No. I'm afraid we'll start talking...

69
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:12,926
...and I'll wind up going partners
with him.

70
00:03:13,663 --> 00:03:15,157
Hey.

71
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:24,214
I could probably shoot him from here.
I'd be doing us both a favor.

72
00:03:27,903 --> 00:03:30,772
I'm wearing some cologne,
all right?

73
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:32,925
Sure. Fine.

74
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:35,132
<i>Casus belli</i>.

75
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:38,741
<i>Casus belli</i>.

76
00:03:39,326 --> 00:03:41,977
-What's that?
-Since when do you wear cologne?

77
00:03:42,142 --> 00:03:43,735
Why is what I do so important?

78
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:46,073
Why must I always be the focal point
of attention?

79
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:48,060
Let me just be. Let me live.

80
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:53,045
-How'd you do on that IQ test?
-I didn't take it yet.

81
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:54,872
-What IQ test?
-What's <i>casus belli</i>?

82
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:58,169
-Oh, it's nothing.
-Is it about me?

83
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:00,537
Why must you always be
the focal point of attention?

84
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:03,483
Why can't you just be?
Why can't you live?

85
00:04:05,053 --> 00:04:09,243
let's just a Latin phrase. It does not
mean anything. Now, what is this test?

86
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:12,503
This woman he's dating is making him
take this IQ test for this course.

87
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,807
-Oh, that sounds like fun.
-Yeah, fun.

88
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:18,964
IQ tests are totally bogus.
They prove nothing.

89
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:21,980
-You'll do well. You're smart.
-No, see, he's not smart.

90
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,401
People think he's smart,
but he's not.

91
00:04:25,564 --> 00:04:27,353
What did you get on your SATs?

92
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:29,654
It varies.

93
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:34,806
-I don't even know my IQ.
-Mine's 1 45.

94
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:38,201
-One forty-five!
-Get out of here.

95
00:04:38,363 --> 00:04:40,567
-You get out of here.
-You get out of here.

96
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:44,016
Maybe you should
take the test for me.

97
00:04:44,187 --> 00:04:47,253
That would be something,
cheating on an IQ test.

98
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:49,817
Remember in college when you
passed Lettick the test...

99
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,222
...out the window?

100
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:54,486
-You became a legend after that.
-Yeah.

101
00:04:54,651 --> 00:04:57,400
Yeah, I really had some guts
back then.

102
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:01,363
-Why don't we do it again?
-What?

103
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:03,124
You could take the IQ test for me.

104
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,138
I'll pass it to you out of a window.
She lives on the first floor.

105
00:05:06,298 --> 00:05:07,607
-You serious?
-Why not?

106
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,625
Where would I take the test?

107
00:05:09,786 --> 00:05:12,600
She lives around the corner.
Take it here or go to the coffee shop.

108
00:05:12,762 --> 00:05:14,769
-No, too noisy.
-Take it at the Dream Cafe.

109
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:16,148
You won't hear a peep.

110
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,144
-Hey, what do you think?
-Hey, I love a good caper.

111
00:05:22,681 --> 00:05:26,805
Yeah, that's what it is, isn't it?
A caper.

112
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:28,463
You'll do it?

113
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:31,921
-What the hey.
-Yeah! Beautiful!

114
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:34,031
Sorry.

115
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:44,338
-Welcome to the Dream Cafe.
-Well, I've been looking forward to it.

116
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:46,643
How did you hear about us?

117
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:48,751
People. People are talking.

118
00:05:50,841 --> 00:05:53,710
Smoking or nonsmoking?
We are proud to offer both.

119
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:55,953
-Nonsmoking would be great.
-Very good.

120
00:05:56,184 --> 00:05:59,762
My name is Babu Bhatt.
I will be your waiter.

121
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:02,674
A steaming hot, folded face cloth
for your pleasure.

122
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,687
-Thank you.
-Our specials are tacos...

123
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:07,888
...moussaka and franks and beans.

124
00:06:09,144 --> 00:06:11,959
Well, what do you recommend,
my good fellow?

125
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:14,933
-The turkey.
-Well, the turkey it'll be.

126
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:17,648
May I say you have a splendid
establishment here, my friend.

127
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:20,815
I'm sure you'll flourish at this location
for many, many years.

128
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:23,121
You're a very kind man.
Very kind. Thank you.

129
00:06:23,735 --> 00:06:25,229
Very kind.

130
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:29,359
<i>Very kind. I am a kind man.

131
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:32,406
<i>Who else would do something</i>
<i>like this? Nobody.

132
00:06:32,694 --> 00:06:34,898
<i>Nobody thinks about people</i>
<i>the way I do.

133
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:36,757
<i>Snap out of it, you stupid jerk.

134
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,307
<i>You're eating a turkey sandwich.</i>
<i>You want a Nobel Prize?

135
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,941
You go in the living room,
I'll take the test in here.

136
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:43,312
But why?

137
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,001
I won't be able to concentrate
in front of you.

138
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:49,996
I think you're making too much of this.
IQ tests don't mean anything.

139
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,508
Are you kidding me?

140
00:06:52,438 --> 00:06:56,235
This is the best tool we have today
of measuring a person's intelligence.

141
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:58,958
Well, I certainly don't place
any importance on it.

142
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:01,230
Well, I think you're wrong
about that.

143
00:07:02,517 --> 00:07:06,314
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd really like to get started, please.

144
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,532
-Good luck.
-Don't need it.

145
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:14,895
What's going on?
I've been here 20 minutes.

146
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:17,166
I'm sorry. Here's the test.
Thanks for doing this.

147
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,115
-What time do you want me back?
-Twenty to 3.

148
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:21,585
-Okay.
-Thanks again.

149
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,007
And don't settle for 1 45.
You can do better. You're a genius.

150
00:07:31,892 --> 00:07:33,932
Thank you, Babu.

151
00:07:34,835 --> 00:07:38,894
You have quite a flair. You are
quite the restaurateur, I must say.

152
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,775
-It is indeed my pleasure.
-Oh, please.

153
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:45,618
Welcome to the Dream Cafe.

154
00:07:46,292 --> 00:07:49,608
-Our specials today--
-Oh, no, no. I'll just have tea and toast.

155
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:53,779
-Tea and toast.
-Eat something! Babu.

156
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:56,429
Okay.

157
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:59,592
Well, I'll have the rigatoni.

158
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:03,243
Oh, very good choice.
Very good.

159
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:07,241
So you got the test. You're cheating.

160
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:09,644
I know.

161
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:12,208
-Hey.
-Hey.

162
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,493
Oh, boy.

163
00:08:18,546 --> 00:08:20,269
Jerry, let me ask you something.

164
00:08:20,434 --> 00:08:22,125
-Hi, Elaine.
-Hey.

165
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:26,160
This guy leaves this jacket
at my mother's house two years ago.

166
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:30,734
She hasn't spoken to him since and
now he says he wants the jacket back.

167
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:33,773
-So?
-Well, I'm not giving it back.

168
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:35,400
Why not?

169
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:39,213
Because I meet a lot of women in
this jacket. They're attracted to it.

170
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:41,711
Why do you think my mother
went out with him?

171
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:46,347
-You all right?
-Yeah. Okay.

172
00:08:46,513 --> 00:08:48,335
What?

173
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,656
Anyway, it's been two years.

174
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:58,635
I mean, isn't there, like,
a statue of limitations on that?

175
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,389
Statute.

176
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:03,497
-What?
-Statute of limitations.

177
00:09:03,664 --> 00:09:05,519
let's not a statue.

178
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,531
No, it's statue.

179
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:10,793
Fine. let's a sculpture of limitations.

180
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:14,863
Wait a minute. Just wait a minute.
Elaine. Elaine.

181
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:19,045
Now, you're smart. Is it ''statue''
or ''statute'' of limitations?

182
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:22,860
-Statute.
-Oh, I really think you're wrong.

183
00:09:24,527 --> 00:09:27,112
Kramer, I have to take this test.
I don't have a lot of time.

184
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,674
What test?

185
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:33,927
-An IQ test.
-Why are you taking an IQ test?

186
00:09:34,095 --> 00:09:36,233
-let's for George.
-George?

187
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:39,047
Look, can I explain it to you later?

188
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:41,189
But why are you taking
an IQ test for George?

189
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:42,635
Would you please?!

190
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:45,644
-Is it for a job or something?
-Later!

191
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:51,690
-You're positive it's statute?
-Yes! Yes!

192
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:54,662
Welcome, welcome.
A steaming hot face cloth--

193
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:08,908
-George?
-Yeah?

194
00:10:09,453 --> 00:10:11,308
The door's locked.

195
00:10:11,469 --> 00:10:13,062
Oh, it's locked?

196
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:15,556
I need to get something.

197
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:19,081
Monica, I'm really focused here.
This stuff's a killer.

198
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:22,022
-George!
-Wish I could.

199
00:10:31,565 --> 00:10:32,972
Babu!

200
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:35,684
lf you don't mind....
Okay.

201
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:39,562
-I'll get this.
-Oh, my God! let's all over the test!

202
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:43,302
-I'm terribly sorry.
-Oh, man!

203
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,956
-I'm out of time, anyway.
-Please forgive me. Please.

204
00:10:46,123 --> 00:10:47,912
Go ahead. I'll take care of it.

205
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:50,786
Please, I'm very sorry.

206
00:10:51,435 --> 00:10:53,257
Tell your friends.

207
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:04,963
let's all right.
She was cheating anyway.

208
00:11:06,219 --> 00:11:08,259
You're a very kind man.

209
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:10,152
Babu....

210
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:14,633
-You're Pakistani, right?
-Yes, Pakistani. Yes.

211
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:17,793
Babu, may I say something?

212
00:11:17,962 --> 00:11:20,231
Of course. You're very smart man.
I listen.

213
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:24,584
I am not a restaurateur by any means,
but it occurred to me that perhaps...

214
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:27,561
...you might serve some dishes
from your native Pakistan...

215
00:11:27,722 --> 00:11:30,624
...as opposed to, say,
the franks and beans, for example.

216
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:33,761
-There are no Pakistani people here.
-It doesn't matter.

217
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,028
You would have the only authentic
Pakistani restaurant...

218
00:11:37,226 --> 00:11:38,632
...in the whole neighborhood.

219
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,028
Yes.

220
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:44,515
You see everything, don't you?

221
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:48,862
Well, you know, not everything.
I do what I can.

222
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:54,883
I close down today. And when I open
again, it will be a Pakistani restaurant.

223
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:58,914
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You're a very special person.

224
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,542
Very special.

225
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:04,616
<i>I am such a great guy.

226
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,425
<i>Who else would've gone to the</i>
<i>trouble to help this immigrant?

227
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:11,103
<i>I am special. My mother was right.

228
00:12:11,304 --> 00:12:15,711
<i>Of course, I've never had</i>
<i>Pakistani food. How bad could it be?

229
00:12:19,943 --> 00:12:24,002
-It was an accident.
-What, did you go on a picnic?

230
00:12:24,232 --> 00:12:26,599
Babu Bhatt did it.

231
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:30,749
Babu Bhatt?

232
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:34,333
-How am I going to explain this?
-Time's up, George.

233
00:12:35,815 --> 00:12:37,637
Okay.

234
00:12:43,942 --> 00:12:45,219
-Here you go.
-How did you do?

235
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:48,317
-Piece of cake.
-What happened to the test?

236
00:12:48,487 --> 00:12:51,138
What? Oh, I spilled some food on it.

237
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:55,039
Food? What food?

238
00:12:55,462 --> 00:12:56,738
What are you talking about?

239
00:12:57,382 --> 00:12:58,592
Where did you get food?

240
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:01,122
-From my pocket.
-Your pocket?

241
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:05,599
I had a sandwich in my pocket.

242
00:13:06,854 --> 00:13:09,788
-And coffee?
-Yeah. Had some coffee, yeah.

243
00:13:10,981 --> 00:13:14,625
-Where did you get the coffee?
-Where did I get the coffee?

244
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:17,439
Where do you think I got the coffee?
At the grocery store.

245
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:19,771
-How did you get there?
-I walked.

246
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:22,878
How did you get out?
I didn't see you leave.

247
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:26,558
-I climbed out the window.
-You climbed out the window?

248
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:29,343
-Of course.
-Why didn't you go out the door?

249
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:31,326
The door?

250
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:36,542
Why would I go out the door?
The window's right here.

251
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:41,919
You're a fascinating man,
George Costanza.

252
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:47,677
The average person sees a situation
like this...

253
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:49,690
...they walk right by it.

254
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:53,466
-Not me.
-You're very special.

255
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:56,960
Hey, do me a favor.

256
00:13:57,124 --> 00:14:00,320
Some guy comes looking for me,
tell him you don't know where I am.

257
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:02,491
Of course. I always do.

258
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:06,332
No, no, it's that guy. He's really
been bugging me about the jacket.

259
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:08,954
-Just give it back to him.
-He'll have to kill me.

260
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:17,501
-Hey, Georgie!
-I'm coming up.

261
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,152
How did you do on the IQ test?

262
00:14:20,387 --> 00:14:22,012
Eighty-five!

263
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:29,919
-What?
-Eighty-five, Jerry! 85 IQ.

264
00:14:32,098 --> 00:14:33,440
Eighty-five?

265
00:14:33,602 --> 00:14:36,351
Well, well, well....

266
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:38,591
He's coming up?

267
00:14:38,785 --> 00:14:40,312
Well, I'm no genius...

268
00:14:40,514 --> 00:14:45,150
...but according to my calculations,
he should be here in a few seconds.

269
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:48,697
Yeah, but an 85?
Jerry, that's ridiculous.

270
00:14:48,865 --> 00:14:51,102
Well, maybe the test
was gender-biased.

271
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,112
You know, a lot of questions
on hunting and testicles.

272
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:03,067
Oh, hello, professor.

273
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:08,792
-George, I cannot believe--
-Please.

274
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:13,215
-No, there's gotta be a mistake.
-You should have seen her face.

275
00:15:13,504 --> 00:15:15,162
It was the same look
my father gave me...

276
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:18,045
...when I told him I wanted
to be a ventriloquist.

277
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:22,550
But an 85?

278
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:24,824
Listen, there were too many
distractions there.

279
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:30,010
Babu whatever his name was.
And Kramer. I couldn't concentrate.

280
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:32,761
It was a madhouse.

281
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:35,100
Jerry, it was.

282
00:15:35,264 --> 00:15:37,653
-Let me take it again.
-Forget it.

283
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:40,791
Oh, come on. Come on.
I'll guarantee you 1 40.

284
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,934
-What do you have to lose?
-You could do worse!

285
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,070
No. No, come on. I guarantee it.

286
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:50,493
-All right, I'll ask her.
-Okay. Now, where am I gonna take it?

287
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:54,451
Take it here. I'll leave.
There'll be no distractions.

288
00:16:01,342 --> 00:16:04,637
Well, congratulations, my friend.

289
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,059
Sorry I missed the grand reopening.
I was out of town for about a week.

290
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:10,486
You see how I listen?

291
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,467
I work very hard,
borrow more money.

292
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:17,693
I think it's fantastic. It has
a certain indefinable charm.

293
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,744
-You wish to eat?
-Let me tell you something, Babu.

294
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,292
You go back in that kitchen,
tell your chef I want the works.

295
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:28,343
Very good.

296
00:16:31,549 --> 00:16:32,956
<i>Very good?

297
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,612
<i>No, not very good...

298
00:16:34,781 --> 00:16:36,210
<i>...very great.

299
00:16:36,381 --> 00:16:39,479
<i>I am very, very great.

300
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:53,619
The IQ tests always have that
sample question at the beginning...

301
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:56,154
...where they show you how
to fill in the circle.

302
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:59,515
This should be the first
elimination point right there.

303
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:01,137
Anybody goes outside that circle:

304
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:04,504
''You wanna come with us, please?
Yeah, you're done. Your test is over.

305
00:17:04,668 --> 00:17:07,220
You went outside the circle, okay?''

306
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,424
-What are you doing?
-Quiet. Don't say anything.

307
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:26,263
-What's going on?
-Hey, Kramer! I saw you go in there!

308
00:17:26,426 --> 00:17:29,012
I'm not leaving till you
give me that jacket!

309
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:32,085
-Open up, Kramer!
-What did you come in here for?

310
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,120
Well, I thought I'd throw him off.
See, he knows where I live.

311
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:38,964
Look, Kramer, I have to return
this test. I've gotta get out of here.

312
00:17:39,386 --> 00:17:42,233
-I thought you took the test.
-I had to take it again.

313
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,728
-How come?
-What's the difference?!

314
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,741
-Well, you can't leave now.
-What?

315
00:17:46,906 --> 00:17:49,295
Come on, Kramer,
I want that jacket back!

316
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:51,833
Never!

317
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,948
Come on, George, open up.

318
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:07,639
-Well?
-How you doing?

319
00:18:09,337 --> 00:18:10,995
Where's the test?

320
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:13,677
You know, it's the damnedest thing.

321
00:18:13,849 --> 00:18:16,783
I went out the window again
to get a cup of coffee....

322
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,847
Babu....

323
00:18:26,008 --> 00:18:27,502
Babu.

324
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:32,973
Babu...

325
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,542
...you know, I've gotta tell you,
I never do this, but the shrimp...

326
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:40,493
...it's just a little stringy.

327
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:44,465
-You have any chicken?
-The shrimp is stringy?

328
00:18:44,632 --> 00:18:46,901
-Well, maybe you refrigerated--
-Quiet!

329
00:18:47,991 --> 00:18:49,747
-No, l--
-You shut up!

330
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:53,075
You make me change restaurant,
but nobody come!

331
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:57,101
You say make Pakistani. Babu Bhatt
have only Pakistani restaurant.

332
00:18:57,591 --> 00:19:01,300
But where are people? You see
people? Show me people!

333
00:19:01,462 --> 00:19:03,023
There are no people!

334
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:06,292
-I think I'll just take the check.
-You bad man!

335
00:19:06,455 --> 00:19:08,724
You very, very bad man.

336
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:14,133
<i>Bad man? Could my mother</i>
<i>have been wrong?

337
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,739
Are you looking for George?

338
00:19:26,006 --> 00:19:27,729
Well....

339
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,776
Kind of.

340
00:19:30,581 --> 00:19:32,239
George left.

341
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:36,274
Is that the test?

342
00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:39,698
This?

343
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,352
Yeah.

344
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:45,260
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

345
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,678
I hope you do a lot better this time.

346
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:54,322
Actually, I think I did.

347
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:59,274
The first time,
I couldn't really concentrate.

348
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:08,971
You know what it was?
Bad location.

349
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,369
Come on, let's not stand here
too long. We might run into her.

350
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:14,897
Aren't you cold?
Where's your jacket?

351
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:19,087
-Oh, sorry.
-I'm going upstairs.

352
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:24,905
Hey, guys. I just ran into Monica.
You know what my IQ is?

353
00:20:25,363 --> 00:20:28,080
One fifty-one.

354
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:30,447
-One fifty-one?
-Yeah.

355
00:20:32,243 --> 00:20:33,737
That's a good score.

356
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:35,944
So, what are you up for?
How about Mexican?

357
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:38,384
-Italian.
-No, Chinese.

358
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,657
You know what would be great?

359
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:57,035
let's tough to do a good deed. Let's look
at your professional good-deed doers:

360
00:20:57,202 --> 00:20:59,274
Your Lone Rangers, your Supermen...

361
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:02,505
...your Batmen, your Spider-Men,
your Elastic Men.

362
00:21:03,154 --> 00:21:06,601
They're all wearing disguises. Masks
over their faces, secret identities.

363
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:11,209
Don't want people to know
who they are. Too much aggravation.

364
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:13,611
''Superman,
thanks for saving my life...

365
00:21:13,777 --> 00:21:16,428
...but did you have
to come through my wall?

366
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:21,737
I'm renting here. They got a security
deposit. What am I supposed to do?''
