1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,300
So I move into the centre lane...

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,800
...I get ahead of this woman who felt,
for some reason, I'd cut her off.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,000
So she pulls up alongside of me,
gives me the finger.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,700
It seems like such an arbitrary,
ridiculous thing...

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,000
...to just pick a finger
and you show it to the person.

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,800
It's a finger. What does it mean?

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,500
Someone shows me
one of their fingers...

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,900
...and I'm supposed to feel bad.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,100
Is that the way it's supposed to work?
I mean...

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,400
...you could just give someone
the toe, really, couldn't you?

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,900
I would feel worse if I got the toe
than if I got the finger.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,500
It's not easy to give the toe.

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,300
You gotta get the shoe off, the sock off
and drive, get it up in the...

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
"Look at that toe, buddy."

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,200
I mean, that's really insulting,
to get the toe, isn't it?

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,800
That it? I've got the Q-Tips,
got the mini-umbrella.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,700
Something boring to read
on the plane.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,400
That's it.

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,900
Done.

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,100
That is the single greatest packing
performance I have ever seen.

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,700
I am the master packer.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
Yeah, right. You're the master packer.

23
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,100
What you must understand, Elaine...

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,300
...packing is like leading men
into battle.

25
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,500
You've got to know the strengths
and weaknesses of every soldier.

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,700
From a collapsible toothbrush
to a pair of ordinary black socks.

27
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,300
Excuse me, master packer?

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,200
Yes?

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,000
- Just give me your keys.
- All right, sir.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,100
- George?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,100
Okay, so, now, is there anything else
I need to know about this place?

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,800
Yeah. The hot water takes a while
to come on. So the best thing to do...

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,300
...is to turn it on,
do all your shopping...

34
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,900
...then come back and take a shower.

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,600
Okay. This is quite a place.

36
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,300
There's more. The refrigerator.

37
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,800
Deduct a minimum of two days
off all expiration dates.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,400
No meat, no leftovers, no butter.

39
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,600
And I cannot overstate this:

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,300
No soft cheeses of any kind.

41
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,400
- Is that clear?
- I'll eat out.

42
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,900
And one more thing, Benes...

43
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,800
...regarding sexual activity.

44
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,500
Strictly prohibited, but if you
absolutely must, do us all a big favour...

45
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,300
...do it in the tub.

46
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,300
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. One second.

47
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,900
- Hey, Elaine.
- Hi.

48
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,700
- You coming to the airport?
- I'm staying for the weekend.

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,400
- I getting a break from my roommate.
- Oh, the actresslwaitress.

50
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,600
No. The waitresslactress.
She just got some part...

51
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,500
...in some dinner theatre production
of A Chorus Line.

52
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,100
So now all day long she's walking
around the apartment singing:

53
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,700
She's gonna get it, right in the...

54
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,300
Why don't you just kick her out.

55
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,400
She's on the lease. George, you have
got to find another place for me.

56
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,300
Yeah, well, a little rough finding
something good in your price range.

57
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,400
Hey, but you, my friend,
may be in luck.

58
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,700
- I'm not looking.
- No, this one's different. It's a beauty.

59
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,800
- What's it like?
- I haven't seen it yet...

60
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,100
...but it's a two-bedroom,
it's on West 83rd...

61
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,400
...about a half-block from the park.
- How much?

62
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,000
Twice what you're paying here,
but it's a great building.

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,500
It's two bedrooms.

64
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,500
Two bedrooms?
Why do I need two bedrooms?

65
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,300
I've got enough trouble
maintaining activity in one.

66
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,500
I saw that.

67
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,300
- You ought to at least take a look at it.
- Really? Why?

68
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,300
Because then I could move in here.

69
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,800
- I know what you're saying now.
- It's time you got out of here, anyway.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,500
Yeah, tell him, but quickly.
I'm double-parked here.

71
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,300
Listen, Jerry,
this place is falling apart.

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,100
You have no hot water.

73
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,100
You can't have soft cheese.

74
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,500
Let's not forget the radiator.

75
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,700
The steam's been on for 10 years.
No human can turn this off.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,100
Jerry, come on.
You're doing okay now.

77
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,400
You should at least
take a look at this place.

78
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,500
- You shouldn't have to live like this.
- You just said you wanted to live here.

79
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,200
Well, for me it's a step up.

80
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,100
It's like moving
from Iceland to Finland.

81
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,700
Jerry, you wanna see
the place or not?

82
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,400
I can't think about it now.
I'm going to Minneapolis.

83
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,900
I got four shows this weekend.

84
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,500
Elaine?

85
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,400
Elaine?

86
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,900
Jerry?

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,700
Jer... Oh, hi.

88
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,400
Welcome back.
How were the shows?

89
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,900
Great. I had fun. Where's the TV?
Where's the VCR?

90
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,300
- What?!
- They were stolen.

91
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,100
Stolen? When?

92
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,700
A couple of hours ago.
The police are coming right over.

93
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,300
Stolen?

94
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,900
Someone left the door open.

95
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,800
Oh, yeah...

96
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,300
You left the door open?

97
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,900
Oh, well, you know, I was cooking...

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,800
...and I came in to get the spatula.

99
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,400
I left the door open because I was
gonna bring the spatula right back.

100
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,500
Wait, you left the lock open
or the door open?

101
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,100
The door.

102
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,900
- The door? You left the door open?
- I was bringing the spatula right back.

103
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,300
Yeah, and...?

104
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,700
Well, I got caught up watching
a soap opera.

105
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,500
Bold and the Beautiful.

106
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,800
- So the door was wide open.
- Wide open.

107
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,100
Excuse me.

108
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,800
And where were you?

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,500
I was at Bloomingdale's,
waiting for the shower to heat up.

110
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,200
Look, Jerry, I'm sorry.

111
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,600
- You have insurance, right, buddy?
- No.

112
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,300
How can you not have insurance?

113
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,300
Because I spent my money
on the Clapco D-29.

114
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
It's the most impenetrable lock
on the market today.

115
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,000
It has only one design flaw:

116
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,000
The door...

117
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,200
...must be closed!

118
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,400
Jerry, I'm gonna find your stuff.
I'm gonna solve it.

119
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm on the case, buddy.
I'm on the case.

120
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Don't investigate. Don't pay me back.
It was an accident.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,300
- I made a mistake.
- These things happen.

122
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,800
- I'm human.
- In your way.

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Let's see, that's one TV, a stereo,
one leather jacket, a VCR, a computer.

124
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,300
- Is that about it?
- The answering machine.

125
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,000
Answering machine.

126
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,600
Boy, I hate the idea of somebody
out there returning my calls.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,300
What do you mean?

128
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,500
It's a joke.

129
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,500
I see.

130
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,300
Well, Mr. Seinfeld, we'll look into it.
We'll let you know if we find anything.

131
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,800
- Do you ever find anything?
- No.

132
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,300
- Well, thanks anyway.
- You bet.

133
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,400
I didn't get that joke either.

134
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,400
The crook has the machine.
The messages aren't for him...

135
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,300
...he's the crook.

136
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,500
Why would he answer...?

137
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,500
How did you get in here?

138
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,700
I walked in.
Your lobby door is broken again.

139
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Again?

140
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
I don't know how
you put up with this.

141
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,800
- Yeah. Tell him, George.
- Thanks.

142
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,800
You would still wanna move in here?

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,700
Yes. You don't understand.

144
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,400
I'm living with Ethel Merman
without the talent.

145
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,300
Is that other apartment still available?

146
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,900
I got ripped off for about the...

147
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,000
...eighteenth time.

148
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,400
The first couple of times
you go through it, it's very upsetting.

149
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,300
Your first reaction,
or one of your friends, will say:

150
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,100
"Call the police.
You really should call the police."

151
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,000
So you think to yourself,
you know, you watch TV, you think:

152
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,500
"Yeah, I'm calling the police.
Stakeouts, manhunts.

153
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,700
I'm gonna see some real action."

154
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,100
Right? You think that.

155
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,500
So the police come over
to your house.

156
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,900
They fill out the report.

157
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,200
They give you your copy.

158
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,800
Now, unless they give
the crook his copy...

159
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,100
...I don't really think we're gonna
crack this case. Do you?

160
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,400
It's not like Batman,
where there's three crooks in the city...

161
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,800
...and everybody pretty much knows
who they are.

162
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,100
Very few crooks go to the trouble...

163
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,900
...to come up with a theme
for their careers anymore.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,600
It makes them a lot tougher to spot.

165
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,000
"Did you lose a Sony?
It could be The Penguin.

166
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,000
I think we can round him up.

167
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,300
He's dressed like a penguin.

168
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,300
We can find him. He's a penguin."

169
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,500
Well, come on.

170
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,000
This is an apartment.
This is a home.

171
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,700
This is a place to live.

172
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,600
A fireplace!

173
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,500
Are you kidding me?
Does this work?

174
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,300
I didn't know there was a fireplace.
A fireplace! That's incredible.

175
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,800
- How do you get all that wood in here?
- They deliver.

176
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,100
- They deliver wood?
- Yeah.

177
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,700
What do you tip a wood guy?

178
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,900
- I didn't know there was a fireplace.
- Look. Look, look at this.

179
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,900
- There's a garden.
- A garden?

180
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,700
I can't believe there's a garden.

181
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,500
- Would I have to get a gardener?
- Yeah, you can get a gardener.

182
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,700
- You tip him?
- You can.

183
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,300
You don't tip a gardener.

184
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,500
- You can tip a gardener.
- You don't need a gardener.

185
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,200
Jerry, you can barbecue back here.

186
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,000
They deliver the coal?

187
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,200
Sure. It's probably the same guy
who delivers the wood.

188
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
Oh, then I gotta tip him.

189
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,900
Oh, man, this place is incredible.

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,700
Look at all this great light.

191
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,300
- I don't have any plants.
- I have plants.

192
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,500
Jerry, look at this closet.

193
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,900
Look at this. I'm walking in it.
It's a walk-in.

194
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,600
Can you believe it? I'm nuts
about this. What do you think?

195
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,100
I like that.

196
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,800
- What do you think, George?
- It's your decision.

197
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,600
I'm taking it. I'm taking the place.
I'm gonna take it.

198
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,200
This is gonna be my new place.
I'm living here.

199
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,500
- I'm moving.
- You're moving?

200
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,300
That means I'm moving.

201
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,700
Gee, is that incredible?

202
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Congratulations.

203
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,600
- What about the couch?
- You like the couch?

204
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,500
- Tell you what I'm gonna do.
- What?

205
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,500
You're moving in, you're a good friend.
I wanna start you off on the right foot.

206
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,600
Give me...

207
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
...a hundred and fifty dollars.

208
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,000
- In fact, get it out of here right now.
- Excuse me.

209
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,700
A hundred and fifty dollars? For what?
For this couch?

210
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,100
- Yeah.
- For this couch?

211
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,200
Okay, you tell me.
What is it worth?

212
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Okay...

213
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,900
I tell you what.

214
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,200
I could go as high as...

215
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,700
I don't know. Maybe...

216
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,200
...twenty dollars?

217
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,500
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's George.

218
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,300
Come on up.

219
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,300
Forget it, I'm gonna take it with me.
I'll just pack up the cushions...

220
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,000
Okay. Okay, you win. $40.

221
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,000
You wanna help me
get it in the hall?

222
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,700
- Fifty dollars, okay? Is that all right?
- Fifty dollars?

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,900
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

224
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,900
Hey. What's going on?

225
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,500
I just bought Jerry's couch for $50.

226
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
So did you bring the lease?

227
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,500
Okay.

228
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,800
Gee, three years.
That kind of seems like a long time.

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,700
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry.

230
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Listen, if you are feeling
uncomfortable about this at all, at all...

231
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,300
...do not feel like you have to take it.

232
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,800
- Why?
- lf you're having second thoughts...

233
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,300
...if you didn't want it...

234
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,100
...don't worry about it,
because, you know, I...

235
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,100
I could take it.

236
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,800
You could take it? You want it?

237
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,900
No, I don't want it.
I want it if you don't want it.

238
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,300
So you do want it.

239
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,300
I want it if you don't want it.

240
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,000
- You just said you wanted it.
- No, I'm saying if a situation arose...

241
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,800
...in which you didn't want it,
I might take it.

242
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,600
- So take it.
- How can I take it?

243
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,600
- How can I take it?
- It's your apartment.

244
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,800
How can I want it now,
if you want it?

245
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,200
Excuse me.
I don't mean to cause any trouble...

246
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,900
...but, George, if you take it,
can I take your place?

247
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,400
Yes, but I am not taking it.

248
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,000
I am not taking it.

249
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,200
Well, one of you better
damn well take it.

250
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,500
- Well, what do you wanna do here?
- I don't know.

251
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,300
You wanna flip a coin?

252
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,000
Who flips?

253
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,900
- You flip, I'll call.
- Okay, fine.

254
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,800
- All right. All right.
- This is the official flip.

255
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,600
No crying, no guilt.
Winner takes all and that's it. Agreed?

256
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,600
- I'm good.
- I don't know who to root for.

257
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,100
George's place has carpeting.

258
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,100
- All right. Now, you call it in the air.
- No catching.

259
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,700
- No, no.
- All right, flip it.

260
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,100
Heads!

261
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,000
- Tails.
- No, it hit the table.

262
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,000
- So what?
- Interference. You can't count that.

263
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,900
Come on, are you crazy?
The coin cannot touch anything.

264
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,800
- It affects it.
- You didn't call "no interference."

265
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,700
You don't have to call it.
That's a rule!

266
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,500
- I don't believe this.
- All right. Fine, Jerry.

267
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,000
- You win. Take it, just take it.
- I don't wanna win it like this.

268
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Elaine, what do you think?

269
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,800
I better not.

270
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
I'll tell you what,
I'll choose you for it.

271
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Straight choose, three takes it.
No disputes.

272
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,700
That's it. You gotta win three.

273
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,300
Okay.

274
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,400
Okay.

275
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,200
I'll choose you.

276
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,300
- What do you want?
- Odds.

277
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,500
- I want evens.
- Good.

278
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,700
- You got odds.
- You got evens.

279
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,100
Right.

280
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,100
- Ready.
- For the apartment.

281
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,000
- Once, twice, three, shoot!
- Mine!

282
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,800
- Once, twice, three, shoot.
- Mine!

283
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,600
- Once, twice, three, shoot!
- Mine!

284
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,000
Once, twice, three, shoot!

285
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,900
Congratulations.

286
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

287
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,900
I'm just gonna wash...

288
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,500
Why did I put out two?
Why did I put out two?!

289
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,000
Jerry? I think I'm on to something.

290
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,400
I think I found your stuff.

291
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,800
You know the Englishman
who lives down the hall?

292
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,200
The last couple days,
he's been acting very strange.

293
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,600
- I think he's avoiding me.
- Hard to imagine.

294
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Yeah, and get this. I just got off the
elevator with him and I tested him.

295
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,300
I tested him, like, this is what I said,
like this. I went:

296
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,100
"Oh, by the way,
I know about the stuff."

297
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,000
You know, very casual so he'll take me
into his confidence.

298
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,100
- So, what did he say?
- "What stuff?"

299
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,600
- Case closed.
- No, no. You don't understand.

300
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,900
See, he swallowed.
See, the guy, he swallowed.

301
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,000
Oh, he was nervous about something.

302
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,300
Now, I'm gonna go over there.
I'm gonna borrow some tea.

303
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,700
If I don't get back in five minutes,
you better call the police.

304
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,700
Okay. Starting now!

305
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,300
Yeah.

306
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,500
One problem in life is...

307
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,400
...as a kid, you have a certain way
of working out disagreements.

308
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,600
And those laws do not work
in the adult world.

309
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,700
One of the main ways that kids resolve
any dispute is by calling it.

310
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,300
One of them says, " I got the front
seat." " I wanted it." " I called it."

311
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,500
And the other kid knows
he's got nothing to say.

312
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,300
"He called it. What can I do?"

313
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,500
If there was a kid court of law,
it holds up.

314
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:29,500
"Your Honour, my client did ask
for the front seat."

315
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,600
And the judge would go,
"Did he call it?"

316
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,500
"Well, no, he didn't call it." Bang.
"He has to call it. Case closed.

317
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,800
Objection overruled."

318
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,400
I love the mirror in that bathroom.

319
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,700
I don't know what in the hell it is,
I look terrific in that mirror.

320
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,100
I don't know if it's the tile
or the lighting.

321
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,600
I feel like Robert Wagner in there.

322
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,700
It's a good mirror.

323
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,100
- What are you getting?
- I don't know.

324
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,800
What can you eat?
You can't have anything anymore.

325
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,700
Look at this, look at this.
Eggs, out. Coffee, out.

326
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,700
French fries, out. BLT, out.

327
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,000
I visit my grandparents,
they're eating big brisket sandwiches.

328
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,100
I'm sitting there with a carrot.

329
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,700
They're closing in on 100, I'm saying
to them, "How can you eat that stuff?"

330
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,900
I'm so sick about losing that choose.
You don't know. I...

331
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,700
All right. Forget it. Forget it.
I'm not taking the place.

332
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,800
- What?
- How can I live there?

333
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,900
- Why not?
- You're still thinking about it.

334
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,700
- I'll never feel comfortable.
- Oh, get out of here.

335
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,600
How can I ever have you over?
You'll sit there moping.

336
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,300
- I won't mope.
- You're already moping.

337
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,100
- Would you take the place?
- No. Impossible. It's your apartment.

338
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,800
- You found the place.
- You won the choose.

339
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,400
All right. Forget it. I'm not moving.

340
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,900
Well, me neither.

341
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,200
- Definitely?
- Definitely.

342
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,400
All right, then, just get rid of it.
You won't have any problem.

343
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,100
No, it's not a problem. I can get rid
of the apartment this afternoon.

344
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,800
What apartment?

345
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,200
Oh, it's a great place.
It's a two-bedroom...

346
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,600
...West 83rd, half-block from the park.

347
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,600
What's the rent?

348
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,600
I hate housewarmings. What are
we doing here? This is ridiculous.

349
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,900
She wanted to thank us
for the apartment.

350
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:33,200
I can't believe I lost the deposit
on that U-Haul...

351
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,300
...and I threw out my couch.

352
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,900
- lf only the coin hadn't hit the table.
- The table is interference, you know it.

353
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,200
- It is not.
- It is too.

354
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,200
My roommate starts rehearsal tonight
on Carousel.

355
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,100
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Carol.

356
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,700
I just wanted to introduce you
to my husband. This is Larry.

357
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,800
This is George, Elaine and Jerry.

358
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,900
These are the guys
who got us the apartment.

359
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,100
You don't know how grateful I am.

360
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,500
If there's anything I can do
to repay you...

361
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,100
- We're just so thrilled with this place.
- It's a dream.

362
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,300
I'm running in the park,
I've lost weight...

363
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,900
...we're barbecuing every night.
And the rent is unbelievable.

364
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,400
We're really glad for you.

365
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,900
Couldn't be happier.

366
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,400
It's wonderful.

367
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,000
Oh, Diane. Diane, come here.

368
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,200
This is my new next-door
neighbour, Diane.

369
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,900
These are the guys who turned
this place down. Can you believe it?

370
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:40,100
Diane gave me the greatest back rub
today. She's a masseuse.

371
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,800
How could you guys
have turned this place down?

372
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,100
It's such a great location
and it's so close to the park.

373
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,400
We're aware of the proximity
to the park.

374
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,100
Well, it was nice to meet you.

375
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
Nice meeting you.

376
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,700
How late are the stores open? I'm
thinking of maybe buying a new TV...

377
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,300
...and smashing it over my head.

378
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,700
So I get a call
from Gilmore this morning.

379
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,900
They're restructuring the organization
in Atlanta. I gotta be there on the 1 st.

380
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,500
Really?
What about your apartment?

381
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,700
What can I do? I'll give it up.

382
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,800
What's the rent?

383
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
