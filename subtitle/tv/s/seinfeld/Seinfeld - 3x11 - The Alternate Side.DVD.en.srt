1
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:03,866
It seems the way they
design the car alarms...

2
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:09,374
...is so that the car will behave as if it
was a nervous, hysterical person.

3
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:13,706
Anyone goes near it,
anyone disturbs it, it's:

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,849
Lights flashing on and off,
acting all crazy.

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,713
Not everyone wants to draw
that much attention to themselves.

6
00:00:19,886 --> 00:00:22,582
Wouldn't it be nice to have
a car alarm that was more subtle?

7
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:25,884
Maybe just, you know, somebody
tries to break in, and it goes:

8
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:33,195
"Excuse me?"

9
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:36,430
I would like a car alarm like that.

10
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,100
Do you believe this?

11
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,904
Car was parked right out front.

12
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,946
-Was the alarm on?
-I don't know. I guess it was on.

13
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:53,279
I don't know my alarm sound.
I'm not tuned into it like it's my son.

14
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:56,586
I don't understand. How do
these thieves start the car?

15
00:00:56,756 --> 00:01:00,055
-They cross the wires or something.
-Cross the wires?

16
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,456
I can't even make a pot of spaghetti.

17
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,927
-Hey.
-They stole my car.

18
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:07,259
-Who did?
-They did.

19
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,334
Was it more than just one?

20
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,026
What should I do?
Call the police?

21
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:13,868
What are they gonna do?

22
00:01:14,474 --> 00:01:18,205
You know, I'd better call the car-phone
company, cancel my service.

23
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,005
Maybe you should
call your car phone.

24
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,149
Yeah.

25
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,546
He's probably driving it right now.

26
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:28,710
Wait a minute. Call the car phone.
See what happens.

27
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,651
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, go ahead. Call.

28
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,725
I don't even know if l
remember the number.

29
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,127
What do I say if he picks up?

30
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,128
-Hello.
-Hello.

31
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,703
-ls this 555-8383?
-I have no idea.

32
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,101
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

33
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:50,604
-Did you steal my car?
-Yes, I did.

34
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,637
-You did?
-I did.

35
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:58,648
-But that's my car.
-I didn't know it was yours.

36
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:02,584
-What are you gonna do with it?
-I don't know. Drive around.

37
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:06,282
-Then can I have it back?
-No, I'm gonna keep it.

38
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,622
Let me talk to him.
Give it, give it, give it.

39
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:13,732
-Hello.
-Yeah, who's this?

40
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,390
-Kramer.
-Hello, Kramer.

41
00:02:15,568 --> 00:02:19,436
Listen, there's a pair of gloves
in the glove compartment.

42
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:21,073
Wait, hold it.

43
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,833
-Brown ones?
-Yeah.

44
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:27,809
Could you mail those to me?
Or bring them by my building.

45
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,348
-It's 1 29 West 81 st Street.
-129.... Okay.

46
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:35,318
All right, thanks a lot.
Here's Jerry.

47
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,781
Gloves.

48
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,790
-Hello.
-Jerry.

49
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,259
Yeah. Let me ask you a question.
How do you cross those wires?

50
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:49,526
I didn't cross any wires.
The keys were in it.

51
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:54,730
Sid left the keys in the car.
All right, I gotta go. Drive carefully.

52
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,305
Hey, Jerry, when's the last time you
had a tune-up? Because I can't find--

53
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,346
-Sid left the keys in the car.
-Who's Sid?

54
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,813
Guy in the neighborhood.
He parks cars on the block.

55
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,282
-What do you mean?
-He moves them from side to side...

56
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,921
-...so you don't get a ticket.
-You pay him for that?

57
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,091
-Yeah. Like 50 bucks a month.
-How many people does he do it for?

58
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,854
-The whole block, 40, 50 cars.
-He only works three hours a day.

59
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,126
He makes a fortune. He's been
doing that for years, right, Jerry?

60
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:22,931
Could anybody do that?

61
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:26,401
-Hey, Sid. What happened?
-I'm sorry, Jerry.

62
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,234
Maybe I'm too old for this stuff.

63
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,103
You left the keys in the car?

64
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:32,904
Well, they're making that
Woody Allen movie on the block...

65
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,980
...and all those people
and trucks everywhere...

66
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:38,413
...and when I saw him,
I must've been distracted.

67
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,746
-You know I'm in that movie.
-You're what?

68
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,115
-Yeah, I'm an extra.
-How'd you get that?

69
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:46,725
Well, I was just watching them film
yesterday, and some guy asked me.

70
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,294
-Right out of the clear blue sky?
-Clear blue sky.

71
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,557
-Why didn't they ask me?
-I got a quality.

72
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:58,830
-Hey, Jerry, you got insurance, right?
-Yeah, but no car. I'll have to rent one.

73
00:03:59,005 --> 00:04:01,599
I'm going to visit my sister
in Virginia next Wednesday...

74
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,605
...for a week, so I can't park it.

75
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,471
-This Wednesday?
-No, next Wednesday.

76
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:06,907
Week after this Wednesday.

77
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,447
But the Wednesday two days
from now is the next Wednesday.

78
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,912
If I meant this Wednesday,
I would've said this Wednesday.

79
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,885
It's the week after this Wednesday.

80
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,349
Sid, who's gonna move the cars
while you're away?

81
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,087
Whoever wants to move them.
What do I care who moves them?

82
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,925
They can move themselves
if they want.

83
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,294
Maybe I could move them
until you get back.

84
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:32,302
What's a young man like you want
to move cars for? You don't work?

85
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,497
I'm in a transition phase right now.

86
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,674
Well, if you want to move the cars,
move the cars.

87
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:41,507
-Just don't forget to take the keys out.
-All right.

88
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:48,184
Hello. Yeah, the defroster's
the one on the bottom.

89
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:50,720
Just slide it all the way over.

90
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,886
You're welcome.

91
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:55,857
I'm in awe of his intellect.
When he talks, it sounds like...

92
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,795
-...he's reading from one of his novels.
-Owen March. I never heard of him.

93
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:03,591
-Well, he's not a baseball player.
-Yeah, that's true.

94
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,797
-lt sounds like it's going pretty good.
-Yeah. Well, there is one little problem.

95
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,499
-What's that?
-He's 66 years old.

96
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:13,237
Next, please.

97
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,210
Go. Go. She--

98
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:16,973
Go. Come on.

99
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,674
Can I help you? Name, please.

100
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:24,483
Seinfeld. I made a reservation
for a midsize, and she's a small.

101
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,323
-I'm kidding around, of course.
-Yes.

102
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,155
Okay, let's see here.

103
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,699
-Sixty-six years old?
-Yeah, well, he's in perfect health.

104
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,665
He works out. He's vibrant.
You'd really like him.

105
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,933
Why do people always say that? I hate
everybody. Why would I like him?

106
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,508
Could you go out
with a 66-year-old woman?

107
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,704
Well, I'll tell you, she would
have to be really vibrant.

108
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,817
So vibrant she'd be spinning.

109
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,845
I'm sorry. We have no midsize
available at the moment.

110
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,218
I made a reservation.
Do you have my reservation?

111
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,259
Yes, we do.
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

112
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,595
But the reservation
keeps the car here.

113
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,995
That's why you have
the reservation.

114
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:12,035
-I know why we have reservations.
-I don't think you do.

115
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:18,306
If you did, I'd have a car.

116
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,412
See, you know how to take
the reservation.

117
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,072
You just don't know how to hold
the reservation.

118
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:29,210
And that's really the most important
part of the reservation, the holding.

119
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,052
Anybody can just take them.

120
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,157
Let me speak with my supervisor.

121
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:38,763
Well, here we go.

122
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,922
The supervisor.

123
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,931
-Know what she's saying over there?
-What?

124
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:46,094
"Hey, Marge, see those two people?
They think I'm talking to you.

125
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,708
So you pretend like you're talking
to me. Okay, now you start talking."

126
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:53,312
"You mean like this? So it looks like I'm
saying something, but I'm not."

127
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,777
"Say something else,
and they won't yell at me...

128
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:58,314
...because they thought
I was checking with you."

129
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,009
"Okay, I think that's enough.
See you later."

130
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:03,917
I'm sorry. My supervisor says
there's nothing we can do.

131
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,359
Yeah, it looked like you were in
a real conversation over there.

132
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,060
Well, we do have a compact
if you would like that.

133
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,163
-Fine.
-All right.

134
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:16,062
Well, we have a blue Ford Escort
for you, Mr. Seinfeld.

135
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:18,795
-Would you like insurance?
-Yeah, give me the insurance...

136
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,099
...because I am gonna beat
the hell out of this thing.

137
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,676
Please fill this out.

138
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,546
Do you think
I'm making a big mistake?

139
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,185
If you enjoy being with him,
that's what's important.

140
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:38,722
I love being with him.
I mean, I like being with him.

141
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,621
It's okay being with him.

142
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,026
-I just don't enjoy being with him.
-Well, that's what important.

143
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,326
I'm meeting him for lunch
at Chadway's.

144
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,959
Do I have to break up face to face,
or can I just do it over the phone?

145
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,231
-How many times have you been out?
-Seven.

146
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,336
Face to face.

147
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:58,477
Seven dates is
a face-to-face breakup?

148
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,636
If it was six, I could've let you go.

149
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,915
But seven, I'm afraid,
is over the limit.

150
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,179
Unless, of course, there was no sex.

151
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:16,684
How's the pasta over there?

152
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,127
What is going on out there?

153
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,564
I need a bucket of water.
I got a car overheating.

154
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,260
I got an alarm that won't go off.

155
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:27,668
I'm pressing one.
I'm pressing two. Nothing.

156
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,933
What do I do? Help me. Help me.

157
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:39,914
They were supposed to do
my scene today.

158
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,519
-Today?
-Yeah.

159
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,384
They said they wanted me to walk down
the block carrying this bag of groceries.

160
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:49,722
So I start to walk, and I trip.
And the grocery bag goes flying...

161
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:53,059
-...and Woody starts laughing.
-He was laughing?

162
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,531
Oh, yeah. He was drinking something.
It started to come out of his nose.

163
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:59,296
-So then what?
-Well, I got a line in the movie!

164
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,736
-Get out!
-That's great.

165
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,807
You got a line
in a Woody Allen movie?

166
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:10,043
-Pretty good, huh?
-You're in the movie?

167
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,810
-ls he in the scene?
-Yeah, it's me and him.

168
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:15,920
I might have a new career
on my hands, huh?

169
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:19,216
You mean "a career."

170
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,988
-So was Mia Farrow there?
-I didn't see him.

171
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,760
-What's your line?
-Well, okay, I'm there with Woody...

172
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,497
...you know. I'm at this bar,
and, you know, it's Woody Allen.

173
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:36,073
-Did I mention that?
-We got it. We got it.

174
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,370
And I'm sitting there with Woody,
and I turn to him and I go:

175
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,810
Boy, these pretzels
are making me thirsty.

176
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:48,943
-ls that how you're gonna say it?
-No, no. I'm working on it.

177
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,055
Do it like this.

178
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:54,989
-These pretzels are making me thirsty.
-No.

179
00:09:55,161 --> 00:10:00,394
-These pretzels are making me thirsty.
-No, no. See, that's no good.

180
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,830
You don't know how to act.

181
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,061
These pretzels...

182
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,802
...are making me thirsty!

183
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,877
-That was no good?
-I didn't say anything.

184
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,447
All right, I'm gonna go
break up with Owen.

185
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,678
What was wrong with that?
I had a different interpretation.

186
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:24,084
Do you know anything
about this pretzel guy?

187
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,156
Maybe he's been in the bar
a long time...

188
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:29,385
...and he's really depressed because
he has no job, and no woman...

189
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,359
...and he's parking cars for a living!

190
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,988
All right! All right!
Shut up! Shut up!

191
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:40,537
I hear you! I'm coming down!
These pretzels are making me thirsty!

192
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,670
Yeah!

193
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,680
Oh, my God.

194
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,478
Call an ambulance.

195
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,053
Boy, he took it hard.

196
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,255
We were walking down the block...

197
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:03,327
...I was about to break up with him,
then he started to twitch.

198
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:07,057
Yes, I need an ambulance at 129
West 81st Street, Apartment 5A.

199
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,428
-Tell them to hurry. Hurry!
-It's an ambulance.

200
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,533
I don't know, but he's unconscious.

201
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,670
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

202
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,713
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

203
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,815
-Kramer.
-What happened here?

204
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:26,543
I don't know. What should we do?
We called an ambulance.

205
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,449
-Anyone know first aid?
-Do something with the extremities.

206
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,419
-What extremities?
-What's an extremity?

207
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,524
You raise the feet,
get blood to the head.

208
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,684
You raise the head,
get blood to the feet.

209
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,455
Okay, what about a cold compress?
They always do that.

210
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,326
-I don't have a washcloth.
-Use a paper towel.

211
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:43,229
-You can't put that on his head.
-What about a big sponge?

212
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,393
-How you gonna hold it on there?
-Use a belt.

213
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:49,098
No, no, no. That'll--
lt'll drip all over him.

214
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,573
-Should we walk him around?
-I've seen them do that.

215
00:11:51,744 --> 00:11:54,269
-That's for a drug overdose.
-Maybe that's what he's got.

216
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:57,075
No, I just had lunch with him.
He didn't leave the table.

217
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,082
Well, he could've dropped acid
when you weren't looking.

218
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:03,053
He is not a drug addict.

219
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,089
Maybe he's diabetic. He might
just need a cookie or something.

220
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,692
-A cookie!
-Can you give him a cookie?

221
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,058
-How's he gonna chew it?
-Move his teeth. Worked for my uncle.

222
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,927
The sugar revived him.

223
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,464
Careful, you're getting crumbs
all over him.

224
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,637
I've got him chewing, but I don't
think he's gonna swallow.

225
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:25,936
Let's put a few cookies in a
blender and he could drink it.

226
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:28,842
-Cookies don't liquefy.
-They do. You can liquefy a cookie.

227
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,505
-I'll get the blender.
-I don't have a blender.

228
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:34,209
-You've got a blender.
-I'd know if I had a blender.

229
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:37,184
Where is the ambulance?!

230
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,656
Hello, yes. I called for an ambulance
like 35 minutes ago.

231
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,801
I can't believe
what's going on out here.

232
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:53,097
This is an emergency.
What's taking so long?

233
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,273
Wait a second.
Maybe that's them.

234
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,772
-Hello.
-Paramedics.

235
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,672
Come on up. Okay, they're here.

236
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:04,582
He seems to be breathing.

237
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,844
You know, I've got to tell you,
he's a pretty good-looking guy.

238
00:13:10,022 --> 00:13:11,284
I know.

239
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:14,153
Those eyebrows could use a trimming.
You ever mention that?

240
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:16,157
Almost.

241
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,888
I mean, because, come on,
they're running wild there.

242
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:22,399
-It's not an easy thing to bring up.
-Yeah, that's true.

243
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,798
You should see his bathrobe, man.
It's all silk.

244
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,768
Yeah. Does he wear slippers.
I bet he wears slippers.

245
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,398
-He does. How'd you know that?
-I could tell.

246
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,009
What happened?
What took you so long?

247
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:37,308
We got here 20 minutes ago,
but we couldn't move.

248
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,418
The intersection is gridlocked.
I've never seen anything like it.

249
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:44,078
Finally we make the turn, and this guy
who was triple-parking cars...

250
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:47,885
-...slammed into us with a blue Escort.
-Blue Escort?

251
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,392
-That's my rent-a-car!
-Oh, man.

252
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:51,757
What happened to the car?

253
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:55,298
I'm sorry. You don't know
what's going on out there!

254
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:56,491
Who's he?

255
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,296
-This guy I'm seeing.
-What happened?

256
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,429
-We don't know.
-Who put cookies in his mouth?

257
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:05,577
-Cookies?
-You're not supposed to do that.

258
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,508
-So how'd you hit the car?
-I was moving it across the street.

259
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,707
I looked up and I saw Woody Allen.
I got all distracted.

260
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:15,479
-It's not even my car. It's a rental.
-What are you doing out there?

261
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:17,849
You're holding up the production
of the movie.

262
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,218
We can't shoot, and Woody,
he's really mad at you.

263
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:22,792
Woody mentioned me?
What did he say?

264
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:26,557
He said, "Who's the moron who's got
the street all screwed up?"

265
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,727
Should I apologize to Woody?

266
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,536
All right, I'll tell you what.

267
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:35,003
Next time I talk to him,
maybe I'll bring it up.

268
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,534
I'll feel him out.

269
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:41,978
What do you think first aid was like
hundreds of years ago?

270
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,047
I mean, they had no medicine,
no drugs...

271
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,913
...no technology, no equipment.
Basically, they were there first.

272
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,022
That was it. That was the whole
first aid. They sit with you.

273
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,249
That's all they could do.
"Can you help me?"

274
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:56,588
"No, we can't help you,
but we were the first ones here.

275
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,061
Did you see our truck?
'First aid.' That's our motto.

276
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,859
We show up before anybody."

277
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:03,968
You didn't say you didn't
know how to drive.

278
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,264
-Should've mentioned that.
-Well, I know how to drive.

279
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,339
Then how did all those cars
get damaged?

280
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,909
Why are people calling me up,
screaming on the phone?

281
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,013
-Most of them canceled out on me.
-Can I get anybody anything?

282
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:18,115
Moving cars from one side
to the other...

283
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,481
...don't take no more sense
than putting on a pair of pants.

284
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:25,784
My question to you is:
Who's putting your pants on?

285
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,118
-I put my pants on, Sid.
-I don't believe you.

286
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,456
You can put your pants on,
you can move cars.

287
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,656
I don't want to get into a big
dispute about the pants.

288
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:37,063
Who's gonna send money to my
sister in Virginia?

289
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,101
Her little boy
needs surgery on his foot.

290
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:43,931
He'll be walking around with a limp,
because you can't park a few cars.

291
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,934
Maybe I could call my father.

292
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:51,107
-Hey, you seen the paper yet?
-lnterestingly enough, no...

293
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,309
...inasmuch as it is my paper.

294
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,044
There's an article on that writer.

295
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:59,748
"Owen March, prominent author and
essayist, suffered a stroke yesterday...

296
00:15:59,925 --> 00:16:02,553
...in the Upper West Side
apartment of a friend."

297
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,219
That's the guy that was here.
You're the friend.

298
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:09,967
Thanks. "The extent of the damage
would've been far less severe...

299
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,195
...had paramedics been able
to reach him sooner."

300
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,302
-Oh, Lord.
-"The commotion also delayed...

301
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,741
...production of a Woody Allen movie
that was shooting up the block.

302
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,444
A spokeswoman
for the legendary filmmaker...

303
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,049
...said that Mr. Allen
was extremely agitated...

304
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:30,882
...and wondered if his days of shooting
movies in New York were over."

305
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:32,488
Five seconds.

306
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,424
Jerry, I was five seconds away
from breaking up with him.

307
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:41,328
Five seconds! The next words out
of my mouth were, "Owen, it's over."

308
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,992
-Can he communicate?
-Yeah. Well, he nods.

309
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,831
And I think he understands me.

310
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,167
He seems to enjoy it
when I read to him.

311
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,071
All right, she's free.

312
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,949
Hi, I called before.
My car got smashed.

313
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,881
So listen. What should I do?
If I break up with him now...

314
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:05,456
...it'll look like I'm abandoning him.
I'll be ostracized from the community.

315
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:07,785
What community?
There's a community?

316
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,325
Of course there's a community.

317
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,225
All these years, I'm living in
a community, I had no idea.

318
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:17,267
Sir, the estimate on the damage
to your car is 2866 dollars.

319
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,564
-I got the insurance and everything--
-Yes, now, in your report...

320
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,537
...you said you weren't the driver
at the time of the accident.

321
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,370
Somebody else was driving it.

322
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:29,640
All right, well, sir, you're only covered
for when you're driving the car.

323
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,147
What's that?

324
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:35,809
-You're not covered for other drivers.
-Other drivers?

325
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:38,957
Your whole business is based
on other drivers. It's a rented car.

326
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,558
That's who's driving it.
Other drivers.

327
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,627
Doesn't my credit card cover me?

328
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,424
-Not that particular one.
-I got a hundred cards.

329
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:49,294
Here, here. Pick a card.
Take any card you want.

330
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,129
Go ahead. Whichever one.
I don't care.

331
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:55,433
-lf you had read the rental agreement--
-Did you see the size of that document?

332
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,371
It's like the Declaration of
lndependence. Who's gonna read that?

333
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:02,241
Mr. Seinfeld, as it stands right now,
you are not covered for that damage...

334
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:06,908
...and there is absolutely nothing
that can be done about that.

335
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,120
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

336
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,398
It's good, isn't it?

337
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,094
Yankee bean.

338
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,405
Why Yankee bean, huh?

339
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:30,804
Don't they have beans
in the South?

340
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:34,139
I mean, if you order Yankee bean
in the South, are they offended?

341
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,310
Yankee bean. Yankee bean.

342
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:48,120
I like my Yankee bean.

343
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:58,729
Owen...

344
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,772
...I think we have to talk.

345
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:10,039
I mean, I have to talk.

346
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:15,751
It would be nice if we could,
but, you know, whatever.

347
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:23,459
Don't get me wrong.
I like coming here and feeding you...

348
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:27,258
...and cleaning a little,
and paying your bills.

349
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,799
I mean, that's good stuff.
Good stuff.

350
00:19:32,938 --> 00:19:37,534
I have a wonderful time when
I'm with you. Wonderful!

351
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:42,013
But at this point in my life,
I'm not really sure...

352
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,880
...that I'm ready to make
a commitment to one person.

353
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:50,385
I'm just not really sure that we
have enough in common.

354
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,320
I mean, for example:

355
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:56,757
I like running in the park...

356
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,453
...bicycling...

357
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:03,363
...roller-skating,
tennis and skiing....

358
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,935
And, well....

359
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:09,301
I'm gonna be brutally honest
with you now.

360
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:13,409
It's a bitch to get here.
It's two subways.

361
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,776
I have to transfer at 42nd Street
to take the double-R.

362
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,350
Anyway, I mean, this doesn't
mean we can't be friends.

363
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,782
These pretzels
are making me thirsty.

364
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,660
Can you die from an odor?

365
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:39,529
I mean, if you were locked in
a vomitorium for two weeks...

366
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:44,005
-...could you die from the odor?
-An overdose of odor. Good question.

367
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,741
Do I smell?

368
00:20:47,946 --> 00:20:51,473
No, no, no. I was just down
at the 42nd Street subway today.

369
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:54,118
It is disgusting.

370
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,153
Guess who I bumped into? Owen.

371
00:20:57,322 --> 00:21:00,314
-He's all right?
-Yeah, he's almost fully recovered.

372
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,359
Told me he
was just using me for sex.

373
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:06,959
-Let me get that.
-I got it.

374
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,498
-Please.
-Let me. I smashed your car.

375
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:11,295
It cost you over 2000 dollars.

376
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,496
Yeah, a cup of coffee
should cover it.

377
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,272
-Oh, man.
-What are you doing here?

378
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,706
I got fired from the movie.

379
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,506
-Get out of here. What?
-What?

380
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,309
Well, you know, they were
going to shoot it today.

381
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,942
We rehearsed it twice,
and then Woody yells, "Action."

382
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,520
I turn to him and I say:

383
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,680
"These pretzels are making
me thirsty."

384
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,258
-Right.
-Then I took a swig of beer...

385
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:39,193
...and I slammed the glass down
on the bar, and it shattered.

386
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:44,625
Well, one of the pieces
must've hit Woody...

387
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,499
...and he started crying.

388
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:50,938
And he yells out, "I'm bleeding,"
and he runs off.

389
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:55,443
Anyway, this woman, she came up
to me, and she says, "You're fired."

390
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,974
Boy, I really nailed that scene.

391
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:04,980
Oh, wait a--

392
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:09,357
Oh, for crying out loud.

393
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:20,694
The best part of a relationship
is when you're sick.

394
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,769
The best part of being sick
is when you're in a relationship.

395
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,933
But if I got married,
you know those vows...

396
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,443
...for richer or for poorer,
for better or for worse.

397
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:31,446
All I need is the sickness.
That is the most important one.

398
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:35,746
"Do you take this man in sickness?"

399
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:37,616
That's the time
I need somebody there.

400
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,882
The rest of the time,
go out, have a ball.

401
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:43,152
But if I get the sniffles,
you better be there.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
