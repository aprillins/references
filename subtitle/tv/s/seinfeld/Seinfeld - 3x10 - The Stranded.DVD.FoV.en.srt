1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,040
So I was in the drugstore trying to get
a cold medication. You ever try this?

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,320
It's an entire wall of medications.

3
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,239
"All right, all right, okay.
What the hell am l...?

4
00:00:14,399 --> 00:00:18,679
This is quick-acting,
but this is long-lasting.

5
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,239
When do I need to feel good?
Now or later?"

6
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,039
It's a tough question.

7
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:26,839
Then the commercials on TV
show you what's wrong with the guy.

8
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:30,479
They always show you the problems.
They show you the human body...

9
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:33,199
...which is usually this guy:.

10
00:00:35,038 --> 00:00:36,239
No face, mouth open.

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,438
This is how drug companies
see the public.

12
00:00:40,278 --> 00:00:42,398
And he's always in, like,
a certain pain.

13
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,878
Like, red, wavy lines are going
through him...

14
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:48,558
...or he's glowing.
Parts of him are on fire sometimes.

15
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,598
Lightning is attacking him.

16
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:53,678
I never had a doctor say,
"Are you having pain?

17
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:56,157
Are you having any lightning
with the pain?"

18
00:01:04,638 --> 00:01:06,597
How did you get fleas?

19
00:01:06,757 --> 00:01:10,477
My cousin's imbecile dog was outside
and they got in his carpet.

20
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:13,557
Maybe you could get yourself
a little bow tie flea collar.

21
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:14,917
That's real funny.

22
00:01:15,437 --> 00:01:17,677
So are you coming to the party?

23
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:20,716
I'd go, but Long Island,
it's so far out.

24
00:01:20,876 --> 00:01:22,437
It smacks of desperation.

25
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:23,996
Everyone's gonna be saying:

26
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:26,356
"You came all the way out
from Manhattan for this?"

27
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:28,716
-You know, Ava's gonna be there.
-Who?

28
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:30,636
The nice one that works
in my office.

29
00:01:31,476 --> 00:01:34,196
-I'll drive!.
-Oh, well, now you're talking.

30
00:01:34,356 --> 00:01:35,636
Supposed to be a good party.

31
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:38,356
Well, what does that mean?
Good dip?

32
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:40,755
No. There'll be girls there.

33
00:01:40,916 --> 00:01:42,436
There's girls everywhere!.

34
00:01:42,596 --> 00:01:44,555
I go out and there's girls
in the elevator.

35
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:47,595
They're in cafeterias, subways.
So what?

36
00:01:47,795 --> 00:01:50,036
There's a hundred
different things here.

37
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:53,275
What's the difference
between these two?

38
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:55,635
-You got propylparaben?
-Got it.

39
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:57,675
You got isobutane 30?

40
00:01:57,875 --> 00:01:59,555
I got isobutane 20.

41
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,875
You got sorbitan sesquioleate?

42
00:02:04,034 --> 00:02:05,635
-Got it.
-I have aloe.

43
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:07,794
You got aloe?
I love aloe.

44
00:02:07,955 --> 00:02:09,355
Where do they make yours?

45
00:02:09,514 --> 00:02:10,995
-Jersey.
-White Plains.

46
00:02:13,914 --> 00:02:16,354
Girls.
There's girls right here in the store.

47
00:02:17,714 --> 00:02:20,474
Look. Look. There's one over there.
Look.

48
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,194
There's another one.

49
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:25,033
As soon as I walk outside,
there'll be girls.

50
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:26,953
What's the matter?

51
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,114
I gave her a 20,
she gave me change for a 1 0.

52
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:32,674
Are you sure?
Oh, boy. Here we go.

53
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:35,113
Excuse me.
I gave you a $20 bill...

54
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:36,993
...and you only gave me
change for a 1 0.

55
00:02:37,153 --> 00:02:39,793
-You gave me a 1 0.
-I'm positive I gave you a 20.

56
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:41,553
I know what you gave me.

57
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:43,112
You owe me $1 0.

58
00:02:43,273 --> 00:02:44,433
Will you please step aside?

59
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:46,193
-Next!
-All right, all right.

60
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:48,872
Let's just examine the situation
for a second.

61
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:52,472
Who, in this situation, would be
more likely to make a mistake?

62
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,632
Me, who had access to my wallet,
knew exactly what was in there...

63
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:58,033
-...or you?
-You.

64
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:00,832
No, no, no. See, you're not
really listening.

65
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,192
-What's the problem here?
-There's no problem.

66
00:03:03,352 --> 00:03:04,872
She just owes me $10. That's all.

67
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:07,312
-He's claiming short.
-Let's just take it outside.

68
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:09,672
Oh, so you don't believe me either?!

69
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:12,591
-Come on. Let's go.
-All right. You haven't won.

70
00:03:12,751 --> 00:03:15,191
You may think you've won,
but you haven't won. Know why?

71
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:17,031
It's not over. This is not over.

72
00:03:17,191 --> 00:03:20,232
I'm not forgetting what's happening
here. You have my $1 0.

73
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:23,272
I will get it back. All right.
Don't worry.

74
00:03:23,431 --> 00:03:25,472
And it's not over.
I'm going now.

75
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:28,311
Goodbye. I will be back.

76
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,231
Well, don't stand here.
Let's walk in.

77
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,550
Blend in. Blend in.

78
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,150
No, let's survey first.
Camp here.

79
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,830
Ava.

80
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,790
What could possess anyone
to throw a party?

81
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:50,510
I mean, to have a bunch of strangers
treat your house like a hotel room.

82
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,910
-Guess who just sold 1 29 West 81st.
-Oh, no, you didn't.

83
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,590
-Get out! When?
-Yesterday.

84
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,669
-I don't believe it.
-Ask Mark.

85
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:01,350
Mark, is this true?

86
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,389
Yeah, this has got "disaster"
written all over it.

87
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,829
How did I let you talk me into this?
I must have been out of my mind.

88
00:04:14,029 --> 00:04:15,948
Listen, let's keep an eye
on each other.

89
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:18,828
In case one of us gets
in a bad conversation...

90
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:22,428
...we should have a signal
so the other one can get us out of it.

91
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:25,428
-How old are you?
-Thirty-six.

92
00:04:26,268 --> 00:04:27,668
What's the signal?

93
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,748
How about this: chicken wing.

94
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:34,588
No, no, no.
I got a better one:

95
00:04:34,748 --> 00:04:36,228
Head-patting.

96
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,628
Whatever you want.

97
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:44,627
You came all the way out
from Manhattan for this?

98
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:46,508
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

99
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:49,427
So, what do you do?

100
00:04:52,707 --> 00:04:55,587
-I'm a comedian.
-Are you?

101
00:04:55,787 --> 00:04:58,627
Let me ask you something.
Where do you get your material?

102
00:04:58,787 --> 00:05:01,387
-I hear a voice.
-What kind of voice?

103
00:05:01,547 --> 00:05:05,387
A man's voice. But he speaks in
German, so I have to get it translated.

104
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:08,707
How come you keep tapping
your head?

105
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:10,146
It's a nervous tick.

106
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:11,987
I'm on L-dopa.

107
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:15,906
On the other hand, you take a guy
like George Washington Carver.

108
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,306
The man devoted his whole life
to the peanut.

109
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:22,546
Imagine having so much passion
for something.

110
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:26,786
You know, people tell me
I'm a funny guy.

111
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:32,546
I've often wondered if he ever worked
with the pecan.

112
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:35,105
Yeah. Me too.

113
00:05:35,306 --> 00:05:39,265
Now, is that considered a nut?
I know the cashew is a legume.

114
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:45,065
-How's it going?
-Great. How about you?

115
00:05:45,785 --> 00:05:47,425
I can't believe
what's happening here.

116
00:05:47,585 --> 00:05:49,505
She hasn't taken her hands
off me all night.

117
00:05:49,665 --> 00:05:52,425
She was always friendly around
the office, but that was it.

118
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,544
-How do you account for this?
-I don't know.

119
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:56,705
Maybe a safe fell on her head.

120
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:59,544
Well, she obviously
liked you all along.

121
00:05:59,705 --> 00:06:01,304
No. I would have picked up on it.

122
00:06:01,464 --> 00:06:04,784
I can always tell. Women always
somehow let you know.

123
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:07,304
With me, they could torture me,
I wouldn't tell them.

124
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:09,504
I try to make them think
I don't like them.

125
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:11,904
Then they think,
"Oh, this guy's not even looking.

126
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:13,984
He must have something
going for him."

127
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:16,103
Anyway, I'm ready to go.

128
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:18,583
-Now?
-Well, if not now, when?

129
00:06:19,304 --> 00:06:22,143
-Give me a half-hour.
-Okay. Half-hour.

130
00:06:22,303 --> 00:06:26,143
Peanut brittle, peanut butter,
peanut oil....

131
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,623
Can I talk to you for a second?

132
00:06:27,783 --> 00:06:29,463
Oh, excuse me.

133
00:06:31,103 --> 00:06:35,463
What have you been doing? I've
been smacking myself senseless.

134
00:06:36,183 --> 00:06:37,943
People think I'm a mental patient.

135
00:06:38,623 --> 00:06:39,942
Hey, I was dying over there.

136
00:06:40,183 --> 00:06:42,142
This guy's going off on the peanut.

137
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,902
Now, pay attention.

138
00:06:44,143 --> 00:06:46,262
Yeah, I think I've seen you in a club.

139
00:06:46,422 --> 00:06:49,142
-You talk about everyday things, right?
-Right.

140
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:51,382
Yeah. I remember you.

141
00:06:53,862 --> 00:06:55,702
I wonder what happened
to my fiancé.

142
00:06:56,222 --> 00:06:57,542
I know he's here somewhere.

143
00:06:58,021 --> 00:07:00,542
Ellen, have you seen my fiancé?

144
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:02,662
-He's upstairs.
-Are you going upstairs?

145
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:05,222
Tell my fiancé I'm looking for him.

146
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:09,382
I have lost my fiancé,
the poor baby.

147
00:07:11,862 --> 00:07:13,861
Maybe the dingo ate your baby.

148
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:18,621
What?

149
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,061
The dingo ate your baby.

150
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,301
You ready?

151
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,060
Listen, l...

152
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:34,820
...have a tremendous favor to ask.

153
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,180
I do favors.

154
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,220
-I think something's happening here.
-What?

155
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,380
I think she wants me
to take her home.

156
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,299
-What should I do?
-Go. What can you do?

157
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,740
-What about you and Elaine?
-We'll get a ride.

158
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:51,060
-You're sure?
-We'll be fine. What did she say?

159
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,860
She told me she--

160
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:57,859
She told me she wants me
to make love to her.

161
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:01,539
-What? She said that?
-Yeah.

162
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:04,658
-Get out of here.
-I swear.

163
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:07,538
-What did you say?
-l....

164
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:10,779
-Oh, I can't.
-Come on. What did you say?

165
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:12,859
-Please, it's, it's....
-What?

166
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:15,258
"l...."

167
00:08:17,058 --> 00:08:18,818
"l...."

168
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:23,458
"l long for you."

169
00:08:23,738 --> 00:08:25,338
-"l long for you"?
-I was so shocked...

170
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:29,658
-...I was lucky I said anything.
-It's okay. That's not bad.

171
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:33,298
I don't like when a woman says
"Make love to me." It's intimidating.

172
00:08:33,457 --> 00:08:36,897
The last time a woman said that to me,
I wound up apologizing to her.

173
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,097
-Really?
-That's a lot of pressure.

174
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:42,657
"Make love to me."
What am l, in the circus?

175
00:08:42,817 --> 00:08:44,617
-What if I can't deliver?
-Oh, come on.

176
00:08:44,777 --> 00:08:46,338
I can't perform under pressure.

177
00:08:46,737 --> 00:08:49,897
That's why I never play anything
for money. I choke.

178
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:52,057
I could choke tonight.

179
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:54,137
And she works in my office.
Can you imagine?

180
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:56,577
If she goes around telling everyone
what happened....

181
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:59,376
Maybe I should cancel.
I have a very bad feeling about this.

182
00:08:59,536 --> 00:09:04,537
-George, you're thinking too much.
-I know, I know. I can't stop it.

183
00:09:06,016 --> 00:09:09,336
Well, right now I'm reading
manuscripts for Pendant Publishing.

184
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:12,056
Pendant? Those bastards.

185
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:14,455
Excuse me.

186
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:19,576
Listen, George is going home
with this Ava from his office.

187
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,536
Really?

188
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:23,415
What a world.

189
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:27,135
-So we can go now.
-No, he's taking the car.

190
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:30,735
-What are we gonna do for a ride?
-I don't know.

191
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:35,255
-You don't know?
-Maybe Kramer can come pick us up.

192
00:09:36,415 --> 00:09:39,615
Great. Oh, this is great.
How could you let him take the car?

193
00:09:39,775 --> 00:09:42,375
There's nothing I could do.
It's part of the code.

194
00:09:43,134 --> 00:09:46,854
All plans between men are tentative.

195
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:50,294
If one man should suddenly have
an opportunity to pursue a woman...

196
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:53,494
...it's like these two guys never met
each other ever in life.

197
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:56,494
This is the male code.

198
00:09:56,774 --> 00:09:59,574
And it doesn't matter how important
the arrangements are.

199
00:09:59,734 --> 00:10:02,574
Most of the time, they screw up
a space shuttle mission, it's because...

200
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:05,574
...one of the astronauts met someone
on his way to the launch pad.

201
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:07,933
They hold that countdown.

202
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:09,814
He's leaning against the rocket:

203
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:13,654
"So when I get back, what do you say
we get together for some Tang?"

204
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,053
Oh, look at what she's wearing.
You see what she's wearing?

205
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:18,413
Yeah, yeah, all right.

206
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:20,693
I can't believe
she's walking around in that.

207
00:10:20,893 --> 00:10:23,133
-Just don't make a scene.
-Hey, is that real fur?

208
00:10:23,292 --> 00:10:25,173
-Oh, boy.
-It better be.

209
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,012
Or my ex-husband owes me
an explanation.

210
00:10:27,173 --> 00:10:28,372
Good night.

211
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:30,933
You don't care that innocent,
defenseless animals...

212
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:32,532
...are tortured so you look good?

213
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:34,452
Could we talk about this
some other time?

214
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:36,693
-Are you a vegetarian?
-Here we go.

215
00:10:36,892 --> 00:10:38,773
Yeah. I eat fish occasionally.

216
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,372
-So you're a hypocrite.
-Hey!

217
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:42,892
I've eaten frogs, so nobody's perfect.

218
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:44,252
Anyway....

219
00:10:44,412 --> 00:10:47,571
-Talk to me when you stop eating fish.
-Fish don't feel any pain.

220
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,692
How do you know?
Do you communicate with fish?

221
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:51,732
Well, they're not kept in little cages.

222
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:53,652
-Ever seen a goldfish?
-Goldfish!

223
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:56,012
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen goldfish.
They're not unhappy.

224
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:57,932
Right. Swim around a bowl
for two weeks...

225
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,412
...and get flushed down the toilet.
That's a good life.

226
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:02,011
Oh, yeah. That's right.

227
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:04,571
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Maybe you can run over a squirrel!

228
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:08,091
Yeah, well, that's why we're here
in America.

229
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:11,091
-You're beautiful.
-Call Kramer.

230
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:12,851
All right.

231
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:15,251
Excuse me.
This is your party, right?

232
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,010
-No. I just live here.
-Can I use your phone?

233
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:19,410
What's in it for me?

234
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,691
-A bigger bill.
-Go for it.

235
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,250
Kram, Sein.

236
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,010
What are you doing?

237
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:31,569
Well, I'm stuck out here
on Long Island.

238
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,970
What are your thoughts
about taking a ride?

239
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,689
You're sure?

240
00:11:35,849 --> 00:11:38,889
Okay, but don't leave me
hanging here.

241
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,769
Okay, great.
Let me give you directions.

242
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,369
You sure you don't need any help?

243
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:52,489
No, not really.

244
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:54,608
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.

245
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:56,329
I want them out of here.

246
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:59,729
-Call him again.
-I called. What should I do?

247
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:02,288
We really appreciate this.

248
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:05,009
It's 2:00 in the morning.

249
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:06,968
Oh, you got the Civil War book.

250
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:11,688
I saw some of that show.
It was wonderful.

251
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:14,768
620 million people died.

252
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,128
Thousand.

253
00:12:16,288 --> 00:12:18,848
Thousand! 620,000.

254
00:12:19,008 --> 00:12:21,207
The horror. The horror!

255
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:23,768
The wife keeps giving us dirty looks.

256
00:12:23,928 --> 00:12:26,768
Are you sure you gave him
the right directions?

257
00:12:26,967 --> 00:12:28,767
-You sure there's nothing we can do?
-No!

258
00:12:28,927 --> 00:12:30,928
I am not going to bed
with them in our house.

259
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:32,367
This is ridiculous.

260
00:12:32,527 --> 00:12:36,247
You know, a friend of my father's
used to live right around here.

261
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:38,407
Mike Wichter.

262
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,127
He sold plastic straws.

263
00:12:42,326 --> 00:12:43,487
You know the ones?

264
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,167
You could bend them.

265
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:52,206
Have you noticed? People don't use
straws as much as they used to.

266
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:55,166
You know, it doesn't look
as if your friend is coming.

267
00:12:55,327 --> 00:12:56,326
Oh, he's coming.

268
00:12:56,486 --> 00:12:59,766
Maybe you should take a look
at a train schedule.

269
00:13:01,726 --> 00:13:03,366
That's him.

270
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:05,486
I'm going to bed!

271
00:13:06,406 --> 00:13:07,766
-Thanks a lot.
-Thanks.

272
00:13:08,286 --> 00:13:09,925
Great party.

273
00:13:12,606 --> 00:13:14,806
-Hey, how you doing?
-Look who's here.

274
00:13:16,605 --> 00:13:18,005
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, it's okay.

275
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:20,286
I had the directions on the seat
right next to me.

276
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:22,245
They flew out the window.

277
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:24,645
Then how did you find the place?

278
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:27,125
Well, I knew the exit
on the Long Island Expressway...

279
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:31,724
...and I thought that the address
was 871 3 Riviera Drive.

280
00:13:31,885 --> 00:13:33,924
So I drove around...

281
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:36,445
...knocking on everybody's doors
that had those numbers.

282
00:13:36,605 --> 00:13:41,285
831 7, 781 3, 371 8, 1 837....

283
00:13:42,044 --> 00:13:44,165
Finally, I hit it. 81 73.

284
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:48,124
Anyway, thanks a lot for letting us
stay here, Steve. I really owe you one.

285
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:49,484
No problem.

286
00:13:49,644 --> 00:13:51,443
And if you're ever in the city...

287
00:13:51,604 --> 00:13:53,804
...you wanna come to a comedy club,
whatever.

288
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:55,924
Hey, I might take you up on that.

289
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:58,284
Here's my address and number.

290
00:13:58,443 --> 00:14:00,003
And, really, thanks again.

291
00:14:01,443 --> 00:14:02,603
Well, you better zip up.

292
00:14:03,123 --> 00:14:05,283
I couldn't get the top
on the convertible up.

293
00:14:07,563 --> 00:14:11,203
-But it's cold out.
-Wait till we get on the Expressway.

294
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,403
George, I've been sick all week.
Elaine was too.

295
00:14:19,562 --> 00:14:22,403
Eighty miles an hour, 40 degree
temperature for 50 minutes.

296
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:24,203
Do the math.

297
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:27,002
Yeah, maybe I will get out.

298
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:30,282
But let me just stop off
at the drugstore first.

299
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:33,362
Meet me down there in 1 5 minutes,
then we'll go do something.

300
00:14:33,522 --> 00:14:35,002
Yeah, Selwyn's.

301
00:14:35,162 --> 00:14:36,362
Okay, bye.

302
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:44,082
-Who is it?
-Mr. Pocatillo!

303
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:47,561
-Who?
-You don't recognize my voice?

304
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:51,241
-Jerry, baby!
-Do I know you?

305
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,961
-Boy, this comedy's frying your brain.
-I'm sorry....

306
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:58,001
See, this is the kind of lasting
impression I make on people.

307
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:01,640
-Oh, okay.
-You said if I was ever in the city.

308
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:03,681
I'm in the city!

309
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,121
You certainly are.

310
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,360
What's going on?

311
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm just waiting for a lift back.
He won't be ready until 11.

312
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,600
I figured I'd give you a break...

313
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,400
...see what it's like to hang out
with someone in show business.

314
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,320
Listen, I'm really sorry, but I'm just
on my way out to meet a friend.

315
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,439
Oh, come on. You can come up
with something better than that.

316
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:25,639
No, really, I just got off the phone
with him.

317
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,160
I understand.

318
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,119
Look, you can hang out here
if you want.

319
00:15:32,359 --> 00:15:33,759
Don't be so enthusiastic.

320
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,799
-No, it's....
-I'm not gonna steal anything.

321
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,359
No, of course not. Just...

322
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,199
...close the door when you leave.

323
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:44,279
-I think I can do that.
-Really, I'm sorry.

324
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:45,639
Maybe another time.

325
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:47,639
Yeah. Let's have lunch.

326
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,239
The guy's in my house right now.

327
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:54,799
What a mistake that party was.
I never should've gone.

328
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,279
-Yeah, me either.
-Oh, come on.

329
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,878
What "come on"? Have you ever dated
a woman that worked in your office?

330
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:04,718
-I never had a job.
-Know that anxiety you feel on a date?

331
00:16:04,878 --> 00:16:07,718
That's what I have every day now.
My worst nightmare's come true.

332
00:16:07,877 --> 00:16:09,598
Every day is a date.

333
00:16:09,758 --> 00:16:13,637
That's one of Dante's nine stages
of hell, isn't it?

334
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:15,798
Ava was one of the reasons
I used to like work.

335
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:17,278
She was a friend.

336
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:20,677
Now we sleep together and suddenly
I don't know how to talk to her.

337
00:16:20,837 --> 00:16:23,078
Every time I go to the bathroom,
I pass her desk.

338
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:26,277
I have to plan little patter.
I spend half my day writing.

339
00:16:26,437 --> 00:16:29,197
Then afterwards I sit in my office
and analyze how it went.

340
00:16:29,357 --> 00:16:32,797
If it was a good conversation, I don't
go to the bathroom the rest of the day.

341
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:35,196
I see her laughing
and talking with other people.

342
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:37,437
They're all so loose and relaxed.
I think:

343
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,357
"That used to be me.
I wanna go back there again."

344
00:16:40,516 --> 00:16:43,077
-What are you gonna do?
-I have no choice.

345
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:44,676
I'm quitting.

346
00:16:49,636 --> 00:16:50,836
The party, Long Island.

347
00:16:51,116 --> 00:16:52,996
-Kramer, right?
-Yeah.

348
00:16:53,156 --> 00:16:55,396
-Hey, what are you doing here?
-Waiting for my ride.

349
00:16:55,595 --> 00:16:57,795
-Where's Jerry?
-He split.

350
00:16:57,996 --> 00:16:59,995
Let me ask you something.

351
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:03,076
Is there anything to drink in here?
Or is that a stupid question?

352
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06,075
Jerry, he doesn't have anything.

353
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:09,195
But I might have something.

354
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:12,955
I'm gonna get this.
This looks good.

355
00:17:13,995 --> 00:17:16,515
-How much is that?
-$9.60.

356
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:18,715
$9.60?

357
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:20,675
Give it to me.

358
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,234
-Why?
-Don't worry, I got it.

359
00:17:22,435 --> 00:17:24,554
-What do you mean, you got it?
-I got it.

360
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:28,075
Since when are you treating me
to medicine? What are you doing?

361
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,474
-You're stealing this, aren't you?
-I'm not stealing. They owe me $1 0.

362
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:33,274
-They stole from me.
-You're a lunatic.

363
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:35,075
I have to. It's a matter of honor.

364
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:37,234
What do you say
to a person like you?

365
00:17:37,434 --> 00:17:38,874
Just walk.
You don't even know me.

366
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:42,514
Excuse me.

367
00:17:44,394 --> 00:17:45,594
What do you got there?

368
00:17:46,954 --> 00:17:50,114
-What?
-What do you got in your shirt?

369
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:56,673
-I was gonna pay for this.
-Come with me.

370
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,033
Where are you taking me?
I was gonna pay for it.

371
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:01,633
-Don't think I remember you?
-What are you talking about?

372
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,513
I know who you are!
I was watching you.

373
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:05,833
What are you gonna do?
You gonna call the police?

374
00:18:05,993 --> 00:18:08,032
-Come on!
-Where--!

375
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:12,193
Can I still buy this
or is this evidence now?

376
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:14,632
So I'm chasing these doves
down the street...

377
00:18:14,792 --> 00:18:17,512
...and she's screaming
at the top of her lungs...

378
00:18:17,672 --> 00:18:20,112
...and then when the magician
comes back from Europe...

379
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:22,152
...two of them turn brown!

380
00:18:22,312 --> 00:18:25,232
Well, I followed the instructions!

381
00:18:30,911 --> 00:18:32,951
They turned brown!

382
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,591
-Brown!
-Brown!

383
00:18:45,831 --> 00:18:49,511
So let me ask you something.
You know any women we could call?

384
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,351
Not really.

385
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,111
Maybe we should call
one of those escort services.

386
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:55,351
Yeah.

387
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,190
I saw one of them advertised
before on the cable station.

388
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,110
555-LOVE.

389
00:19:02,951 --> 00:19:04,710
-Are you in on this?
-Oh, no, no.

390
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:07,430
I got a girl in the next building.

391
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,390
Now, I want my money, mister!
And I ain't leaving till I get it.

392
00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:19,510
Now, I am through
playing games with you.

393
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,310
I got things to do.

394
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,669
Oh, Jerry, Jerry.

395
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:26,429
Look who's here.
It's Jerry.

396
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:27,749
What the hell--?

397
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,069
-Jerry, this is Patti.
-Nice to meet you.

398
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:32,949
A pleasure to make
your acquaintance.

399
00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:34,469
What the hell is going on here?

400
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:36,829
I don't know,
but I gotta do this more often.

401
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,668
There's my ride, finally.

402
00:19:41,828 --> 00:19:44,668
I'm not gonna go anywhere
until I get the rest of my money.

403
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:48,308
See you, Jer, and tell Kramer thanks.
I'll call him tomorrow.

404
00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:49,748
Oh, Kramer.

405
00:19:49,908 --> 00:19:51,788
Yeah, he's a hoot.

406
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:54,988
Goodbye, my dear.

407
00:19:57,547 --> 00:20:01,827
Weekend of the 26th, come on out.
We're having another party.

408
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:04,668
I ain't leaving.

409
00:20:05,428 --> 00:20:07,828
-Patti.
-You got anything to drink?

410
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,867
-All right, how much does he owe you?
-$50.

411
00:20:13,227 --> 00:20:15,027
Fifty dollars....

412
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:21,467
-Is this your apartment?
-Yeah, but--

413
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:25,507
-You're under arrest for solicitation.
-Oh, wait a second. I....

414
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:27,986
I have chicken soup.

415
00:20:30,466 --> 00:20:31,667
Is that real fur?

416
00:20:31,826 --> 00:20:33,587
-Oh, boy.
-Oh, boy.

417
00:20:36,506 --> 00:20:39,066
You had Sergeant Chadway?
Me too.

418
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:41,786
-He was a nice guy.
-Oh, great guy.

419
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:44,865
Was there a redheaded guy there?

420
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:46,785
-The one with the long sideburns?
-Yeah!

421
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,425
-Where does he come off?
-I know.

422
00:20:48,585 --> 00:20:50,945
There's no call
for that kind of attitude.

423
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:53,945
One of the guys in my cell
threw a piece of gum at him.

424
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:56,346
We all hated him.

425
00:20:57,186 --> 00:20:59,386
There's two types of favors:
big favor, small favor.

426
00:20:59,585 --> 00:21:01,665
You can measure the size
of the favor...

427
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:06,425
...by the pause that a person takes
after they ask you to "do me a favor."

428
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:09,944
Small favor, small pause:
"Do me a favor? Hand me that pencil."

429
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:11,385
No pause at all.

430
00:21:11,545 --> 00:21:14,104
Big favors are:
"Could you do me a favor?"

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
