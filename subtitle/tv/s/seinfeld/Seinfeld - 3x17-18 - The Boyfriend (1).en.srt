1
00:00:03,783 --> 00:00:05,693
At the health club,
people are working out...

2
00:00:05,863 --> 00:00:07,751
...and they're training,
getting in shape...

3
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:11,773
...but strangely, nobody's really
getting in shape for anything.

4
00:00:11,942 --> 00:00:14,659
The only reason that you're
getting in shape...

5
00:00:14,822 --> 00:00:17,343
...is that so you can get through
the workout.

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,670
So we're working out...

7
00:00:20,838 --> 00:00:25,148
...so that we'll be in shape
for when we have to do our exercise.

8
00:00:25,638 --> 00:00:27,132
This is the whole thing.

9
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:29,920
The other thing I don't get
is why we're so careful...

10
00:00:30,086 --> 00:00:34,046
...about locking up our dirty towels
and smelly jockstraps.

11
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:40,609
What exactly is the black market
on these disgusting gym clothes?

12
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,108
Ill give my car to any guy
in front of a restaurant...

13
00:00:43,269 --> 00:00:45,538
...because he's got a short
red jacket.

14
00:00:45,701 --> 00:00:47,108
''He must be the valet guy.''

15
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:49,571
But my stinking,
putrefied gym clothes...

16
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:51,489
...I got one of these locks...

17
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:54,271
...you could put a bullet through it
and it won't open.

18
00:00:54,437 --> 00:00:55,898
That stuff is safe.

19
00:01:01,637 --> 00:01:04,026
Wide open!
I was wide-open underneath.

20
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:06,138
I had three inches on that guy.

21
00:01:06,308 --> 00:01:07,868
See, you two were hogging the ball.

22
00:01:08,036 --> 00:01:10,141
Me? It wasn't me.
I never even saw the ball.

23
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:11,585
All you do is dribble.

24
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:15,065
I have to dribble. lf I give it to you,
you just shoot. You're a chucker.

25
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:16,643
-Oh, Im a chucker.
-That's right.

26
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:18,528
Every time you get the ball,
you shoot.

27
00:01:18,692 --> 00:01:19,902
I can't believe you
called me a chucker.

28
00:01:20,068 --> 00:01:22,489
No way Im a chucker! I do not chuck.
Never chuck!

29
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,409
Never have chucked!
Never will chuck! No chuck!

30
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:27,770
You chuck.

31
00:01:28,516 --> 00:01:31,265
-Kramer, am I a chucker?
-Oh, you're a chucker.

32
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:34,435
My God, Im a chucker.

33
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:39,069
-All these years, you never told me?
-It's not an easy thing to bring up.

34
00:01:40,547 --> 00:01:43,776
Hey, you know, this is the first time
we ever saw each other naked?

35
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:48,351
Believe me, I didn't see anything.

36
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:50,238
Oh, you didn't sneak a peek?

37
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:53,496
-No. Did you?
-Yeah, I snuck a peek.

38
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,870
-Why?
-Why not?

39
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,343
What about you, George?

40
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:00,448
Yeah, l...

41
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:03,097
...snuck a peek.

42
00:02:03,266 --> 00:02:06,648
But it was so fast, I didn't see
anything. It was just a blur.

43
00:02:06,818 --> 00:02:08,444
I made a conscious effort not to look.

44
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,846
There's certain information
I just don't wanna have.

45
00:02:11,394 --> 00:02:12,855
Okay....

46
00:02:13,409 --> 00:02:15,035
I gotta go meet Newman.

47
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:18,269
-Ill see you later. Have a good one.
-All right.

48
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:20,283
Yeah.

49
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:24,062
Look at this guy.

50
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:27,225
Does he have to stretch in here?

51
00:02:28,225 --> 00:02:29,469
-You know who that is?
-Who?

52
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:31,159
That's Keith Hernandez.

53
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:34,432
Keith Hernandez,
the baseball player?

54
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:36,671
Yeah, that's him.

55
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:39,102
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

56
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:42,014
Wow! Keith Hernandez!

57
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:43,900
-He's such a great player.
-Yeah.

58
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:46,269
He's a real smart guy too.
He's a Civil War buff.

59
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,051
Wow, Id love to be a Civil War buff.

60
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,631
What do you have to do
to become a buff?

61
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:56,471
So Biff wants to be a buff?

62
00:02:56,992 --> 00:02:59,447
Well, sleeping less than 1 8 hours
a day would be a start.

63
00:03:02,912 --> 00:03:04,821
I only got two weeks left
of unemployment.

64
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:07,860
I gotta prove Ive been looking
for a job to get an extension.

65
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,198
Hey, should we say something
to him?

66
00:03:10,367 --> 00:03:13,018
Oh, Im sure he loves to hear
from fans in the locker room.

67
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:15,387
Well, he could say hello to me.
I wouldn't mind.

68
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,947
He's Keith Hernandez.

69
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:20,184
You're Jerry Seinfeld.

70
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:27,549
-So?
-What, you're comparing yourself...

71
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:29,020
...to Keith Hernandez?

72
00:03:29,183 --> 00:03:31,834
The guy's a baseball player,
Jerry, baseball!

73
00:03:31,998 --> 00:03:34,748
I know what he is. I recognized him.
You didn't even notice him.

74
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,779
What, you're making some wisecracks
in a nightclub?

75
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:43,961
The guy was in game six, two runs
down, two outs, facing elimination!

76
00:03:44,126 --> 00:03:45,304
Excuse me.

77
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,542
I don't want to disturb you.
Im Keith Hernandez.

78
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,841
And I just want to tell you what
a big fan I am. I love your comedy.

79
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:58,168
-Really?
-Ive always wanted to do what you do.

80
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:01,301
Do what I do?! You're one
of my favorite ballplayers of all time!

81
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:02,746
Mine too.

82
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:07,636
-I love that bit about Jimmy Olsen.
-Really?

83
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,750
Thank you.

84
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:12,853
You know, Keith,
what Ive always wondered is...

85
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:15,606
...with all these ball clubs
flying around all season...

86
00:04:15,772 --> 00:04:18,325
...wouldn't you think
there'd be a plane crash?

87
00:04:23,516 --> 00:04:25,141
Are you performing in New York now?

88
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:27,413
At this club on the East Side.
You should come in.

89
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,711
But think about it:
26 teams, 1 62 games a season.

90
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:34,258
You'd think eventually, an entire team
would just get wiped out.

91
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:38,808
I live on the East Side.

92
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:40,181
Ill give you my number...

93
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,257
...and just tell me whenever
you want to go.

94
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:45,078
-Or maybe just get together for coffee.
-Oh, that'd be great.

95
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,401
Well, it's only a matter of time.

96
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:51,158
Who's this chucker?

97
00:04:56,283 --> 00:04:58,836
Its been three days,
and he hasn't called.

98
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:00,506
Well, maybe you should call him.

99
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,260
I can't. I can't.

100
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:05,939
-Why not?
-I just feel like he should call me.

101
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,350
What's the difference?

102
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:10,263
You don't understand, Elaine.
I don't want to be overanxious.

103
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:14,103
lf he wants to see me,
he has my number. He should call.

104
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,538
God, look at this ashtray.
I hate cigarettes.

105
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:21,655
I can't stand these guys.

106
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:24,403
You give your number to them,
and then they don't call.

107
00:05:25,786 --> 00:05:27,215
Why do they do that?

108
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:29,491
Im sorry, honey.

109
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,257
I mean, I really thought he liked me.
We were getting along.

110
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:36,433
He came over to me.
I didn't go over to him.

111
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:39,318
-I know.
-Why did he come over to me?

112
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:42,515
I mean, here I meet this great guy,
this ballplayer...

113
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,568
-...best guy I ever met.
-Yeah. I know.

114
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:48,690
Well, that's it. Im never giving
my number out to another guy again.

115
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:52,850
Ive given my number out to guys,
and it takes them a month to call.

116
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,493
Good. Good.
Well, if he's calling in a month...

117
00:05:56,665 --> 00:05:58,519
...he's got a prayer.

118
00:06:00,536 --> 00:06:03,383
You know, maybe he's been busy.
Maybe he's been out of town.

119
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:05,715
Oh, what, they don't have phones
out of town?

120
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,653
I love how people say
they're too busy. ''Too busy.''

121
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:10,798
Pick up a phone!

122
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:13,618
Takes two minutes.
How can you be too busy?

123
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:18,194
-Why don't you just go and call him?
-I can't call here. Its a coffee shop.

124
00:06:18,359 --> 00:06:21,872
-I mean, what am I gonna say to him?
-Just ask if he wants to get together.

125
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:23,853
For what, dinner?

126
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,413
Dinner's good.

127
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:31,212
Don't you think that's coming on a little
too strong? Isn't that, like, a turnoff?

128
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:33,941
Jerry, he's a guy.

129
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:38,287
I know, but this is all very confusing.

130
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:41,940
When you're in your 30s,
it's very hard to make a new friend.

131
00:06:42,102 --> 00:06:45,135
Whatever the group is you've got now,
that's who you're going with.

132
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:47,822
You're not interviewing,
not looking at any new people.

133
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,056
You're not interested in seeing
any applications.

134
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:53,710
They don't know the places.
They don't know the foods.

135
00:06:53,878 --> 00:06:55,404
They don't know the activities.

136
00:06:55,574 --> 00:06:58,836
lf I meet a guy at a club or a gym:
''Hey, look, Im sure you're very nice.

137
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:02,161
You seem to have a lot of potential.
We're just not hiring right now.''

138
00:07:02,325 --> 00:07:03,470
When you're a kid...

139
00:07:03,637 --> 00:07:06,768
...you can be friends with anybody.
Remember when you're a little kid...

140
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:09,999
...what are the qualifications? ''lf
someone's in front of my house...

141
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:12,554
...that's my friend.
They're my friend. That's it.

142
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:15,375
Are you a grownup?
No? Great. Come on in!

143
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,889
Let's jump up and down on my bed!''
And if you have anything in common:

144
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:22,476
''You like cherry soda? I like
cherry soda! We'll be best friends!''

145
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:31,084
You only have two more weeks
before your benefits run out.

146
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:34,157
Yes, and I was hoping, perhaps,
to get...

147
00:07:34,324 --> 00:07:36,691
...a 1 3-week extension,
if that's possible.

148
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:39,083
So where have you been looking
for work?

149
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:41,008
You know what Ive discovered,
Mrs. Sokol?

150
00:07:41,363 --> 00:07:43,251
Its not so much the looking...

151
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:44,589
...as the listening.

152
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,570
I listen for work.
As Im looking...

153
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:50,578
...and listening-- Im also looking.
You cannot discount looking.

154
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,649
Its a combination.
Its looking. And listening.

155
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,049
Listening. And looking.
But you must look.

156
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:58,414
Can you be specific
about any of these companies?

157
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,683
Specific. Let's see....

158
00:08:00,851 --> 00:08:02,761
Ive walked in and out
of so many buildings.

159
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,337
They all blend in together.

160
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:06,025
Just give me one name.

161
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:08,009
One name. Absolutely.

162
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,539
Let's see, there's....

163
00:08:10,706 --> 00:08:11,884
Vandalay Industries.

164
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,439
I just saw them. I got very close there.
Very close.

165
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,519
What type of company is that?

166
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:18,984
Latex. Latex manufacturing,
Mrs. Sokol.

167
00:08:19,698 --> 00:08:23,081
-And you interviewed there?
-Yes, for a sales position.

168
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,624
Latex salesman.

169
00:08:24,786 --> 00:08:28,528
The selling of latex
and latex-related products.

170
00:08:29,713 --> 00:08:31,688
They just wouldn't give me a chance.
Damn it!

171
00:08:31,858 --> 00:08:35,087
Now Im going to need an address
and a phone number for this...

172
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,427
...Vandalay company.

173
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:38,310
You like gum?

174
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:41,645
Because I have a friend in the gum
business. I got a gum guy!

175
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:44,776
I make one phone call, have boxes
of gum delivered right to your door.

176
00:08:44,945 --> 00:08:46,538
The address?

177
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:49,580
The address is....

178
00:08:52,337 --> 00:08:54,312
Jose Jimenez.
Do you recognize that?

179
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:58,214
-No.
-Jose Jimenez.

180
00:08:59,376 --> 00:09:01,645
Very funny.
Really, he's very funny.

181
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,434
The address.

182
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:07,790
Vandalay is...

183
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:11,497
...1 2<i>9</i> West 81 st Street.
Its a very small industry, Vandalay.

184
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:13,420
Its why I wanted
to work for them.

185
00:09:13,584 --> 00:09:15,406
A phone number.

186
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:18,186
That's...KL5...

187
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:20,775
...8383. Are you planning on
calling them soon?

188
00:09:20,943 --> 00:09:23,082
Because they have
very strange hours.

189
00:09:23,248 --> 00:09:24,491
As soon as Im done with you.

190
00:09:25,487 --> 00:09:27,210
Sure. Well....

191
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,546
You know, Ill check in with you
next week.

192
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:33,224
I gotta run now because
I got a full plate this afternoon.

193
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:37,166
-Okay.
-All right. Really good to....

194
00:09:43,118 --> 00:09:44,066
He'll call you back!

195
00:09:44,238 --> 00:09:45,580
Its a par five.

196
00:09:45,742 --> 00:09:47,367
So, you know, I step up to the tee...

197
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:50,850
...and I hit a beautiful drive
right down the middle of the fairway.

198
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:53,389
-I mean, you know my hook, right?
-Elaine?

199
00:09:53,774 --> 00:09:55,301
How about this shirt?
Is this okay?

200
00:10:00,846 --> 00:10:03,213
Jerry, he's a guy.

201
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:07,653
Well, it's a dogleg left,
so I play the hook.

202
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:10,057
Wait, hold on.
There's another call.

203
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,743
-Jerry! Jerry!
-George?

204
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:15,276
-<i>Kramer, put Jerry on!</i>
-Im in the middle of something.

205
00:10:15,437 --> 00:10:17,706
-Call back.
-<i>Kramer, no</i>--<i>!

206
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:20,356
So the ball takes off,
and Im waiting for it to turn.

207
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:28,905
Would you--!

208
00:10:31,372 --> 00:10:33,827
All right. Well, Ill talk to Jerry.
Yeah.

209
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:36,514
Hey, that was Michael and Carol.

210
00:10:36,684 --> 00:10:38,571
She's wondering when
we'll go see the baby.

211
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:41,700
-See the baby. Again with the baby.
-Who are they?

212
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,966
A guy who used to live in the building
keeps calling us to see the baby.

213
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:48,230
''You gotta see the baby.
When are you gonna see the baby?''

214
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:49,889
Can't they just send us a tape?

215
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:52,612
Maybe if you wait a few months,
it won't be a baby anymore.

216
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,463
-Then you won't have to see it.
-Because he'll be all grown-up.

217
00:10:55,627 --> 00:10:56,903
Yeah....

218
00:10:58,251 --> 00:11:00,520
Hey, Kramer, what do you think
of this shirt?

219
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:07,237
Its too busy.

220
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:09,639
You're trying too hard
to make an impression on him.

221
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,007
-You're not being yourself.
-What guy?

222
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,553
I know he's just a guy,
but I really like him.

223
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:18,121
Who are you talking about?

224
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:20,743
Keith...Hernandez.

225
00:11:20,906 --> 00:11:22,761
Keith Hernandez?

226
00:11:23,403 --> 00:11:25,541
Keith Hernandez!

227
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:29,190
Do me a favor, would you?
Would you change lanes?

228
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:31,394
You gotta get out of this lane.
This lane stinks.

229
00:11:31,562 --> 00:11:34,245
They're all double-parked.
Get out, Im begging you.

230
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,588
Please. Please!

231
00:11:40,682 --> 00:11:41,991
You know what?

232
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,779
Bad mistake. My mistake.

233
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:46,116
Go back. Your lane was better.
Forget this lane.

234
00:11:46,281 --> 00:11:49,151
This lane stinks. Go back to your lane.
Go ahead. Bad mistake.

235
00:11:49,513 --> 00:11:52,993
Go! Go! Go! Make this light!
Make this light! Oh, man!

236
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:55,010
That's it! Get out!

237
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:57,217
-What do you mean, get out?
-Get out of the cab!

238
00:11:57,385 --> 00:11:59,043
What? Im not getting out of this cab.

239
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:02,078
No! No! You cannot throw me out!

240
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:04,485
No! Get....

241
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:06,339
Hello, Newman.

242
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:07,714
I hate Keith Hernandez.

243
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,597
-Hate him!
-I despise him.

244
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,800
-Why?
-Why? Ill tell you why.

245
00:12:12,968 --> 00:12:14,375
-Let me tell her.
-No, you can't--

246
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:16,194
-You always tell.
-All right, tell it.

247
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,334
-Just tell it.
-All right.

248
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:22,878
June 14th, 1987, Mets-Phillies.

249
00:12:23,048 --> 00:12:26,179
We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon
in the right-field stands...

250
00:12:26,344 --> 00:12:28,515
...when a crucial Hernandez error
opens the door...

251
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,647
...to a five-run Phillies ninth.
Cost the Mets the game!

252
00:12:31,815 --> 00:12:34,597
Our day was ruined.

253
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,821
There was a lot of people waiting
by the players' parking lot.

254
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,420
Now we're coming down the ramp.

255
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,315
<i>Newman was in front of me.

256
00:12:41,479 --> 00:12:43,421
<i>Hernandez was coming toward us.

257
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,576
As he passes us, Newman turns
and says, ''Nice game, pretty boy.''

258
00:12:51,014 --> 00:12:53,250
<i>Hernandez continued past us</i>
<i>up the ramp.

259
00:12:53,414 --> 00:12:56,381
Then, a second later,
something happened...

260
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,292
...that changed us in a very deep
and profound way...

261
00:13:00,454 --> 00:13:02,145
...from that day forward.

262
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,413
-What was it?
-He spit on us!

263
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:09,125
<i>And I screamed out, ''I'm hit!''

264
00:13:10,566 --> 00:13:14,908
Then I turned, and the spit ricocheted
off him, and it hit me.

265
00:13:17,765 --> 00:13:19,358
What a story.

266
00:13:19,525 --> 00:13:22,143
Unfortunately, the immutable laws
of physics contradict...

267
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:24,578
...the whole premise of your account.

268
00:13:24,741 --> 00:13:27,261
Allow me to reconstruct this,
if I may, for Ms. Benes...

269
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:29,917
...as Ive heard this story
a number of times.

270
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:32,932
Newman, Kramer,
if you'll indulge me.

271
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:35,395
According to your story...

272
00:13:35,557 --> 00:13:38,426
<i>...Hernandez passes you</i>
<i>and starts walking up the ramp.

273
00:13:38,597 --> 00:13:40,833
Then you say you were struck...

274
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:43,231
...on the right temple.

275
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:46,686
The spit then proceeds to ricochet...

276
00:13:46,852 --> 00:13:50,746
...off the temple, striking Newman
between the third and the fourth rib.

277
00:13:53,348 --> 00:13:55,039
The spit then came off the rib...

278
00:13:55,204 --> 00:13:58,400
...made a right turn,
hitting Newman in the right wrist...

279
00:13:59,908 --> 00:14:02,242
...causing him to drop
his baseball cap.

280
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:07,229
The spit then splashed off the wrist,
pauses...

281
00:14:07,395 --> 00:14:09,337
...in midair, mind you...

282
00:14:10,659 --> 00:14:15,263
...makes a left turn and lands
on Newman's left thigh.

283
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:20,188
That is one magic loogie.

284
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,954
Well, that's the way it happened.

285
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,927
What happened to your head
when you got hit?

286
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,813
Well, my head...

287
00:14:34,978 --> 00:14:36,734
<i>...went back, to the left.

288
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:39,386
-Say that again.
-Back and to the left.

289
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,105
Back and to the left.

290
00:14:43,137 --> 00:14:45,952
Back and to the left.

291
00:14:46,562 --> 00:14:47,871
So, what are you saying?

292
00:14:48,033 --> 00:14:49,691
Im saying...

293
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:53,305
...that the spit could not have
come from behind.

294
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:56,671
That there had to have been
a second spitter.

295
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:06,553
<i>Behind the bushes,</i>
<i>on the gravelly road.

296
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:09,533
lf the spitter was behind you,
as you claim...

297
00:15:09,697 --> 00:15:13,144
...that would've caused your head
to pitch forward.

298
00:15:14,145 --> 00:15:17,941
So the spit could've only come
from the front and to the right.

299
00:15:18,112 --> 00:15:21,014
But that's not what they
would have you believe.

300
00:15:22,272 --> 00:15:23,701
Im leaving.

301
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:25,370
Jerry's a nut.

302
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:27,870
Wait, wait, wait.

303
00:15:28,416 --> 00:15:31,415
The sad thing is,
we may never know the real truth.

304
00:15:38,463 --> 00:15:40,667
Did anybody call
asking for Vandalay Industries?

305
00:15:40,831 --> 00:15:43,580
-No, what happened to you?
-All right, listen closely:

306
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,980
I was at the unemployment office.

307
00:15:46,143 --> 00:15:49,339
I told them I was very close to getting
a job with Vandalay Industries...

308
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,252
...and I gave them your phone number.
So when the phone rings...

309
00:15:52,415 --> 00:15:54,781
...you have to answer,
''Vandalay Industries.''

310
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:57,146
-Im Vandalay Industries?
-Right.

311
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:59,415
-What is that?
-You're in latex.

312
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:01,142
-Latex?
-Right.

313
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,994
-What do I do with latex?
-I don't know! You manufacture it!

314
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:08,051
-Right here in this little apartment?
-And what do I say about you?

315
00:16:08,254 --> 00:16:10,556
You're considering hiring me
for your latex salesman.

316
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:13,559
-Ill hire you as my latex salesman?
-Right.

317
00:16:13,725 --> 00:16:16,213
I don't think so.

318
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,480
Why would I do that?

319
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,067
Because I asked you to.

320
00:16:22,238 --> 00:16:24,409
lf you think Im looking for someone
to just sit...

321
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:27,421
...pushing papers around,
you can forget it.

322
00:16:27,581 --> 00:16:30,428
Ive got enough headaches
just trying to manufacture the stuff.

323
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:34,935
-Yeah?
-Its Keith.

324
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:36,442
All right, we're coming down.

325
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:37,881
Keith Hernandez?

326
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:40,434
-Yeah. Come on, Elaine, let's go.
-Where are you going?

327
00:16:40,604 --> 00:16:42,131
They're giving me a ride downtown.

328
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,018
You know, there had to have been
a second spitter. Who was it?

329
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:46,358
Who had the motive?

330
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:49,590
That's what Ive been trying
to figure out the past five years.

331
00:16:49,756 --> 00:16:51,665
What the hell are you two
talking about?

332
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,761
-That was really fun. Thanks.
-Yeah, it really was.

333
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:58,358
<i>Should I shake his hand?

334
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,826
Well....

335
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:02,679
You want to catch a movie
this weekend?

336
00:17:02,844 --> 00:17:04,818
Have you seen <i>JFK</i>?

337
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:08,052
No, I haven't.

338
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:10,778
<i>This weekend. Wow!

339
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:13,522
Sure. That would be great.

340
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,685
<i>Damn. I was too overanxious.</i>
<i>He must have noticed that.

341
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:19,919
I mean, if you want to.

342
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:22,906
-Well, how about this Friday?
-Yeah, Friday's okay.

343
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:26,517
<i>Go ahead, shake his hand.</i>
<i>I'm Jerry Seinfeld.

344
00:17:26,682 --> 00:17:28,722
<i>I've been on</i> The Tonight Show.

345
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:31,889
Well, good night.

346
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:33,368
Good night.

347
00:17:33,658 --> 00:17:35,545
Oh, Jer, by the way...

348
00:17:35,707 --> 00:17:37,462
...the woman we gave
a ride to earlier....

349
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:38,836
-Elaine.
-Yeah.

350
00:17:39,034 --> 00:17:41,620
-What's her story?
-I don't know. We used to go out.

351
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:44,853
Would you mind if I gave her a call?

352
00:17:45,017 --> 00:17:47,384
-For a date?
-Yeah.

353
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:49,138
Oh, no....

354
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:50,899
Go ahead.

355
00:17:51,066 --> 00:17:52,560
You got a pen?

356
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,071
You sure you don't mind?

357
00:18:04,665 --> 00:18:06,007
So then we went to dinner.

358
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:07,892
-Who paid?
-We split it.

359
00:18:08,056 --> 00:18:09,518
Split it. Pretty good.

360
00:18:09,785 --> 00:18:12,948
-Did you talk about game six?
-No. I gotta wait until it's the right time.

361
00:18:16,473 --> 00:18:17,749
-Yeah?
-<i>It's Elaine.

362
00:18:17,912 --> 00:18:19,286
Come on up.

363
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:20,823
So then what?

364
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,959
Nothing. Then he took me home.

365
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:25,044
Shake his hand?

366
00:18:26,296 --> 00:18:27,670
Yeah.

367
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:29,687
What kind of a shake does he have?

368
00:18:30,168 --> 00:18:31,445
Good shake. Perfect shake.

369
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:33,746
Single pump, not too hard.

370
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:37,938
Didn't have to prove anything,
but firm enough to know he was there.

371
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:39,860
So...

372
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:41,998
...you're gonna see him again?

373
00:18:44,183 --> 00:18:46,452
He asked me if I was doing anything
Friday night.

374
00:18:47,415 --> 00:18:49,237
The weekend!

375
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:52,948
So then, as I was getting out
of the car--

376
00:18:53,111 --> 00:18:54,485
-Hi!
-Oh, hi, Elaine.

377
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:55,824
Hi, Elaine.

378
00:18:55,991 --> 00:18:57,846
So how was your date?

379
00:18:59,446 --> 00:19:01,585
What date? Its a guy.

380
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:04,336
So you know.... He called me.

381
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:06,387
-Already?
-Keith called you?

382
00:19:08,662 --> 00:19:10,550
This guy really gets around.

383
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:17,582
-Do you mind?
-No, I don't mind. Why should I mind?

384
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,564
What did he say?

385
00:19:19,734 --> 00:19:21,589
He asked me out for Saturday night.

386
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,347
-You going?
-No.

387
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,648
-I told him I was busy.
-Oh, really?

388
00:19:25,813 --> 00:19:27,755
So we're going out Friday.

389
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:35,918
-Friday?
-Yeah.

390
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,996
He's going out with you on Friday?

391
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:41,905
-Yeah?
-He's supposed to see me on Friday.

392
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:46,218
-I didn't know.
-We made plans!

393
00:19:46,901 --> 00:19:49,453
-Well-- Ill cancel it.
-No, don't cancel it.

394
00:19:50,676 --> 00:19:53,578
Well, this is a little
awkward, isn't it?

395
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:55,604
Well, frankly, it is.

396
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:59,282
Ive never seen you jealous before.

397
00:19:59,444 --> 00:20:01,419
Well, you're not even a fan.
I was at game six.

398
00:20:01,588 --> 00:20:02,798
You didn't even watch it.

399
00:20:02,964 --> 00:20:04,720
Wait a second. Wait a minute.

400
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:07,437
Are you jealous of him
or are you jealous of me?

401
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,097
Any Hennigan's around here?

402
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:24,714
Vandalay Industries.

403
00:20:27,187 --> 00:20:29,489
Kell Varnsen speaking.

404
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:32,075
May we help you?

405
00:20:32,627 --> 00:20:34,798
Oh, hi, Keith.
No, I was just joking around.

406
00:20:36,115 --> 00:20:37,740
No, no, I don't mind at all.

407
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:41,136
-No, no, no. I can cancel.
-Sure. We'll do something next week.

408
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:43,054
No, it's no problem at all.

409
00:20:43,218 --> 00:20:45,607
Okay. Take it easy.

410
00:20:46,194 --> 00:20:48,747
That was Keith.
We're gonna do something next week.

411
00:20:49,202 --> 00:20:50,893
Hey, what are you doing
Friday night?

412
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:53,425
Friday night? Nothing. Now.

413
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:55,535
Want to come to see the baby?

414
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:59,726
Oh, fasten your seat belts.
We're going to see the baby.

415
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,825
lf you don't see the baby now,
you're never gonna see her.

416
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:05,775
-All right, Ill go.
-All right. All right.

417
00:21:17,424 --> 00:21:18,701
Ill get it.

418
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,705
Yello.

419
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:23,727
What delay industries?

420
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:25,230
-No!
-Vandalay!

421
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:26,603
Say Vandalay!

422
00:21:26,768 --> 00:21:28,939
No, you're way, way, way off!

423
00:21:29,104 --> 00:21:31,657
Yeah, that's the right number,
but this is an apartment.

424
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:33,962
-No, say--
-Vandalay! Say--

425
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:36,070
Vandalay Industries!

426
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:38,985
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

427
00:21:44,496 --> 00:21:46,863
How did you know who they wanted?!

428
00:21:54,351 --> 00:21:57,318
And you want to be
my latex salesman.

429
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:05,676
Just sign here, please.

430
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,588
I know who it was too.
It was the guy that interviewed me.

431
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,368
He was very threatened by me.
Why else wouldn't he hire me?

432
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:14,949
-I could sell latex like that.
-Just sign that.

433
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,928
-Who is this?
-Its my daughter.

434
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:29,291
This is your daughter?

435
00:22:30,062 --> 00:22:31,917
My God!

436
00:22:32,078 --> 00:22:34,118
My God!

437
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:37,668
I hope you don't mind my saying,
she is breathtaking.

438
00:22:39,469 --> 00:22:41,291
You think so?

439
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:44,998
Would you take this picture away
from me? Just take it away.

440
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:47,402
Get it out of here.
Take it away, and put it away.

441
00:22:47,565 --> 00:22:49,670
Let me just sign this and go.

442
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:51,014
You know...

443
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:53,253
...she doesn't even have a boyfriend.

444
00:22:54,157 --> 00:22:56,066
Okay. Okay.

445
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:58,598
Who do you think you're talking to?

446
00:22:58,765 --> 00:23:01,099
You trying to make a joke,
Mrs. Sokol? Its not funny.

447
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,438
I can tell you that.

448
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,298
Im serious. She doesn't.

449
00:23:04,972 --> 00:23:07,820
You know, it's one thing to not
give me the extension.

450
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:11,046
But to tease and
to torture me like this...

451
00:23:11,212 --> 00:23:12,619
...there's no call for that.

452
00:23:13,323 --> 00:23:15,047
Would you like her phone number?

453
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:21,895
Mrs. Sokol,
I don't know what to say.

454
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,795
-Where should I sign this thing?
-No, no, no, no. Don't worry about it.

455
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:29,825
Unemployment, it's a tough thing.

456
00:23:29,995 --> 00:23:32,929
Even if you get a job after
you've been unemployed...

457
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:36,328
...they take unemployment out
of your check every week...

458
00:23:36,491 --> 00:23:39,338
...and show it to you in that little box.

459
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:43,618
How good can it be for your
confidence that every paycheck...

460
00:23:43,786 --> 00:23:46,753
...has the word ''unemployment''
on it?

461
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,834
Can't get it out of your mind!
You just got the job!

462
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,231
They're already getting ready
for you to be laid off.

463
00:23:52,394 --> 00:23:54,216
I have a friend who's unemployed.

464
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:56,102
He's collecting unemployment
insurance.

465
00:23:56,266 --> 00:24:01,764
This guy has never worked this hard
in his life to keep this thing going.

466
00:24:02,281 --> 00:24:07,071
He's down there every week waiting
on the lines and getting interviewed...

467
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:10,111
...and making up all these lies
about looking for jobs.

468
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:15,584
lf they had any idea the effort
and energy that he is expending...

469
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:18,852
...to avoid work, Im sure they'd give
him a raise. Im sure of it.

470
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:21,794
The guy is doing a tremendous job...

471
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,335
...not working.

472
00:24:25,897 --> 00:24:28,166
So tell me more
about this game six.

473
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:31,143
Well, there was two outs,
bottom of the tenth.

474
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:33,923
We're one out away
from losing the series.

475
00:24:41,384 --> 00:24:43,456
Hello. How are you?

476
00:24:45,096 --> 00:24:47,517
So, what do you think?

477
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,793
Do you love her?

478
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,327
Yes, I do love her.

479
00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:55,718
You have a very nice place here.

480
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,789
So who do you think she looks like?

481
00:24:57,959 --> 00:24:59,388
Lyndon Johnson.

482
00:25:00,424 --> 00:25:02,845
What? Lyndon Johnson?

483
00:25:03,015 --> 00:25:04,160
He's joking.

484
00:25:04,327 --> 00:25:07,643
No, Im not joking.
She looks like Lyndon Johnson.

485
00:25:07,815 --> 00:25:11,131
Jerry, I can't believe it took you
so long to see the baby.

486
00:25:11,302 --> 00:25:14,531
I kept saying to Michael, ''When is
Jerry going to see the baby?''

487
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,219
I was saying the same thing.

488
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,725
Take a picture.
Michael, get the camera.

489
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:22,180
-You don't have to take a picture.
-I don't know where it is.

490
00:25:22,342 --> 00:25:25,125
Its in the bottom drawer
of our dresser.

491
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:26,880
Hurry up!

492
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:29,729
He's such an idiot.

493
00:25:31,494 --> 00:25:33,883
Jerry, you want to pick her up?

494
00:25:34,054 --> 00:25:35,810
-I better not.
-Ill pick her up.

495
00:25:35,974 --> 00:25:37,435
<i>No!

496
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:41,473
Thank you for a wonderful time,
George.

497
00:25:41,638 --> 00:25:42,848
Glad you enjoyed it.

498
00:25:43,014 --> 00:25:46,112
I haven't had a Big Mac
in a long time.

499
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:48,066
Billions and billions.

500
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,170
Would you like to come up?

501
00:25:52,325 --> 00:25:54,113
Would I like to come up?

502
00:25:54,277 --> 00:25:56,960
I would love to come up.

503
00:25:57,124 --> 00:25:58,651
Im...Im fighting not to.

504
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:00,381
Fighting.

505
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,108
Unfortunately, l...

506
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:07,546
...I have to get an early start tomorrow.
Gotta get up and hit that pavement.

507
00:26:07,717 --> 00:26:10,302
But it's Saturday.
All the offices are closed.

508
00:26:11,428 --> 00:26:14,297
I got me an appointment
with a hardware store.

509
00:26:14,468 --> 00:26:16,889
Im not saying I want to do it
for the rest of my life...

510
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,915
...but hardware fascinates me.

511
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:21,410
Wouldn't you love to make a key?

512
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:26,332
Will you call me as soon
as you get home?

513
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,525
-Tonight?
-Yes.

514
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:35,066
Will I call you when I get home?
What do you think?

515
00:26:36,643 --> 00:26:39,545
You kill me. You really kill me.

516
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:42,778
Well, good night.

517
00:26:48,291 --> 00:26:51,073
It was an accident. Right, Jerry?
It was an accident.

518
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,623
Oh, she's gonna be all right.

519
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:57,145
Here, baby. Here.
Here, baby.

520
00:26:57,314 --> 00:27:00,064
Baby, baby, baby.
Who's the baby?

521
00:27:00,514 --> 00:27:02,041
I have a friend who's got a baby.

522
00:27:03,074 --> 00:27:04,929
''Gotta see the baby.

523
00:27:05,186 --> 00:27:09,015
You've got to come over
and see the baby.''

524
00:27:10,914 --> 00:27:14,209
Nobody ever wants you to come over
and see their grandfather, do they?

525
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,239
''You've got to see my grandfather.
You've got to see him.

526
00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:19,231
He's so cute.

527
00:27:19,393 --> 00:27:24,827
1 68 pounds, 4 ounces.
I love them when they're this age.

528
00:27:24,993 --> 00:27:26,367
He's 1 000 months.

529
00:27:26,529 --> 00:27:30,206
You know, the mid 80s is such
a good time for the grand-people.

530
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:32,060
The mid 80s, you gotta see them.

531
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:34,843
He went to the bathroom
by himself today.''

532
00:27:36,768 --> 00:27:39,768
You know what's tough about seeing
people when they have a baby...

533
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:43,035
...is that you have to match
their level of enthusiasm.

534
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,273
You know what I mean?
They're always so excited.

535
00:27:45,441 --> 00:27:46,967
''What do you think of him?''

536
00:27:47,136 --> 00:27:48,991
Id like to meet a couple that goes:

537
00:27:49,152 --> 00:27:52,348
''You know, we're not that happy
with him, frankly.

538
00:27:52,512 --> 00:27:55,807
I think we really made a big mistake.
We should have got an aquarium.

539
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:58,618
You want him? We don't even
want him. You want him?''

540
00:28:01,248 --> 00:28:04,215
Thanks for a nice evening.
This was really fun.

541
00:28:04,384 --> 00:28:05,845
Yeah, it was.

542
00:28:06,623 --> 00:28:09,590
<i>Gosh, should I kiss her good night?

543
00:28:10,335 --> 00:28:12,637
<i>Is he going to try and kiss me?

544
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:16,157
-I love Cajun cooking.
-Really?

545
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,107
You know, my mom's
one-quarter Cajun.

546
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:21,086
Oh, my father's half-drunk.

547
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:26,101
Maybe they should get together.

548
00:28:26,846 --> 00:28:28,308
<i>Go ahead. Kiss her.

549
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:30,780
<i>I'm a baseball player, damn it.

550
00:28:31,871 --> 00:28:33,431
<i>What's he waiting for?

551
00:28:33,598 --> 00:28:35,485
<i>I thought he was a cool guy.

552
00:28:37,022 --> 00:28:40,764
<i>Come on. I won the MVP in '7 9.</i>
<i>I can do whatever I want to.

553
00:28:43,678 --> 00:28:45,979
<i>Well, this is getting awkward.

554
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:49,653
Well, good night.

555
00:28:49,821 --> 00:28:51,031
Good night.

556
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:58,843
<i>Who does this guy think he is?

557
00:28:59,006 --> 00:29:01,013
<i>I'm Keith Hernandez.

558
00:29:03,837 --> 00:29:05,015
Who else?

559
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:07,580
Mookie. Mookie was there.

560
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:09,334
You know him?

561
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,759
Well, I don't know him.
I know who he is.

562
00:29:13,724 --> 00:29:15,928
He's such a great guy.
You should meet him.

563
00:29:16,092 --> 00:29:19,474
-He's the one who got that hit--
-I know. He got the hit in game six!

564
00:29:21,404 --> 00:29:22,713
So then what happened?

565
00:29:23,644 --> 00:29:24,921
Nothing. The he took me home.

566
00:29:26,972 --> 00:29:29,110
So did you two...

567
00:29:31,547 --> 00:29:32,758
...have....

568
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,958
What?

569
00:29:37,307 --> 00:29:38,998
You know.

570
00:29:39,643 --> 00:29:40,756
Milk?

571
00:29:43,547 --> 00:29:46,514
-No.
-Cookies?

572
00:29:48,123 --> 00:29:49,716
Did he kiss you good night?

573
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:51,640
I don't know.

574
00:29:52,795 --> 00:29:54,551
What do you mean, you don't know?

575
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:58,165
All right. He kissed me, okay?

576
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,792
Well, what kind of a kiss?

577
00:29:59,962 --> 00:30:03,956
Was it a peck? Was it a kiss?
Was it a long make-out thing?

578
00:30:04,826 --> 00:30:06,834
Between a peck and a make-out.

579
00:30:08,218 --> 00:30:10,073
So you like him.

580
00:30:10,554 --> 00:30:12,659
I don't understand.
Before you were jealous of me.

581
00:30:12,826 --> 00:30:14,200
Now you're jealous of him?

582
00:30:14,362 --> 00:30:16,980
Im jealous of everybody.

583
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:23,607
Hello.

584
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,712
Oh, hi. What's happening?

585
00:30:26,841 --> 00:30:28,085
What?

586
00:30:31,225 --> 00:30:32,435
Sure.

587
00:30:34,137 --> 00:30:35,315
Yeah, okay.

588
00:30:35,481 --> 00:30:38,099
Then.... Ill see you then.

589
00:30:38,265 --> 00:30:39,509
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

590
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:40,850
Bye.

591
00:30:41,593 --> 00:30:43,796
-Who was that?
-That was Keith.

592
00:30:44,824 --> 00:30:47,956
-What's going on?
-He wants me to help him move.

593
00:30:48,952 --> 00:30:51,286
Help him move?

594
00:30:51,448 --> 00:30:52,757
Move what?

595
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,441
You know, furniture.

596
00:30:57,048 --> 00:30:58,673
So, what did you say?

597
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,207
I said, yes, but I don't feel right
about it.

598
00:31:01,368 --> 00:31:03,637
I mean, I hardly know the guy.

599
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,517
That's a big step
in a male relationship.

600
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,462
The biggest.
That's like going all the way.

601
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:14,671
And you feel you're not
really ready for--

602
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,497
Well, we went out one time.

603
00:31:16,663 --> 00:31:19,413
Don't you think that's coming on
a little too strong?

604
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:22,130
Hey.

605
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:25,549
What's going on?

606
00:31:26,199 --> 00:31:28,402
Keith Hernandez just asked me
to help him move.

607
00:31:28,822 --> 00:31:30,099
What?

608
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:32,722
Well, you hardly know the guy.

609
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,648
What a nerve!

610
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:40,661
You see? Wasn't I right
about this guy? Didn't I tell you?

611
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,997
Oh, you're not gonna do it, are you?

612
00:31:44,118 --> 00:31:47,184
-I said, yes.
-You said yes?!

613
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:50,355
Don't you have any pride
or self-respect?

614
00:31:50,518 --> 00:31:53,714
I mean, how can you prostitute
yourself like this?

615
00:31:53,877 --> 00:31:55,950
Are you gonna start driving him
to the airport?

616
00:31:56,342 --> 00:31:58,197
Im not driving him to the airport.

617
00:31:58,358 --> 00:32:00,081
Oh, boy. I don't know.

618
00:32:00,597 --> 00:32:02,931
-Kramer, do me a favor, would you?
-What?

619
00:32:03,093 --> 00:32:04,435
Don't mention it to anybody.

620
00:32:04,597 --> 00:32:06,899
I wish you never mentioned it to me.

621
00:32:17,876 --> 00:32:20,178
I had a great time tonight, Carrie.

622
00:32:20,341 --> 00:32:22,413
And I will call you
as soon as I get home.

623
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,173
Don't bother.

624
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:26,382
Bother? What kind of bother?

625
00:32:26,548 --> 00:32:28,915
I would prefer it if you didn't.

626
00:32:29,428 --> 00:32:32,592
-Why? Is anything wrong?
-Its over, buddy. Done.

627
00:32:32,756 --> 00:32:37,393
Finished. So long. Goodbye.
<i>Adios. Sayonara</i>.

628
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,307
-Why?
-Ive been thinking about it.

629
00:32:40,467 --> 00:32:42,507
You got no job.
You got no prospects.

630
00:32:42,676 --> 00:32:44,683
You're like Biff Loman.

631
00:32:46,771 --> 00:32:48,626
I went to the hardware store
interview.

632
00:32:48,788 --> 00:32:51,057
You think Im going to spend my life
with somebody...

633
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,218
...because he can get me a deal
on a box of nails?

634
00:32:55,187 --> 00:32:56,747
I thought we were a team.

635
00:32:57,395 --> 00:32:59,850
lf I ever need a drill bit, Ill call you.

636
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,709
Carrie, could you do me a favor?

637
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,209
Could you not mention this
to your mother?

638
00:33:06,802 --> 00:33:09,006
You know, I hate to brag...

639
00:33:09,874 --> 00:33:12,689
...but I did win 11 straight
Gold Gloves.

640
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,305
I wouldn't have brought it up,
but since you mentioned it.

641
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:17,452
I didn't mention it.

642
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:20,113
Well, I won them anyway.

643
00:33:20,626 --> 00:33:22,764
Well, so what? I mean...

644
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,970
...you played first base.

645
00:33:25,138 --> 00:33:27,504
I mean, they always put
the worst player at first base.

646
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:30,382
That's where they put me,
and I stunk.

647
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:35,436
Elaine, you don't know the first thing
about first base.

648
00:33:36,145 --> 00:33:39,527
Well, I know something
about getting to first base...

649
00:33:39,697 --> 00:33:42,217
...and I know you'll never be there.

650
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:44,518
The way I figure it,
Ive already been there.

651
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,656
And I plan on rounding second
tonight at around 11:00.

652
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,939
Well, Id watch the third-base coach
if I were you...

653
00:33:53,105 --> 00:33:56,039
...because I don't think
he's waving you in.

654
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,735
You know, I hate to say this...

655
00:34:01,904 --> 00:34:04,554
...but I really think that
we're hitting it off.

656
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,535
-Get it? Get it?
-Clever.

657
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:12,750
-What are you doing?
-What's that?

658
00:34:13,327 --> 00:34:15,302
-You smoke?
-Yeah.

659
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:18,189
I didn't know you smoked.

660
00:34:19,472 --> 00:34:20,933
Is that a problem?

661
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:28,294
She likes him.
I mean, she really likes him.

662
00:34:28,463 --> 00:34:30,252
-How do you know?
-Who wouldn't like him?

663
00:34:30,415 --> 00:34:31,789
I like him, and Im a guy.

664
00:34:32,463 --> 00:34:34,830
I suppose he's an attractive man.

665
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:37,958
Forget that. He's a ballplayer.
MVP, 1 <i>9</i> 7<i>9</i>.

666
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:41,738
Im making wisecracks in some
nightclub. This guy was in game six.

667
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,947
They're a perfect match.
They go together.

668
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,728
Like one of these brother and sister
couples that look alike.

669
00:34:46,894 --> 00:34:50,243
I hate those couples. I could never be
one of those couples.

670
00:34:50,414 --> 00:34:53,163
There are no bald women around,
you know.

671
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,695
I know this sounds a little arrogant,
but I never thought she'd find...

672
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:01,349
...someone she liked better
than me. But, you know...

673
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,786
...I guess I had my chance.
And that's that.

674
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:05,640
You know what Id like to do?

675
00:35:06,093 --> 00:35:08,876
Id really like to have sex
with a tall woman.

676
00:35:09,038 --> 00:35:12,834
I mean really tall, like a giant.
Like 6'5''.

677
00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:14,855
Really?

678
00:35:15,021 --> 00:35:17,192
What was the tallest woman
you ever slept with?

679
00:35:17,357 --> 00:35:18,851
I don't know, 6'3''.

680
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:21,671
Wow! God!

681
00:35:22,573 --> 00:35:25,158
See, this is all I think about:
Sleeping with a giant.

682
00:35:26,413 --> 00:35:28,201
Its my life's ambition.

683
00:35:28,364 --> 00:35:31,877
So I guess it's fair to say you've set
different goals for yourself than...

684
00:35:32,044 --> 00:35:34,727
...say, Thomas Edison, Magellan,
these type of people.

685
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:36,965
Magellan? You like Magellan?

686
00:35:37,132 --> 00:35:40,515
Oh, yeah. My favorite explorer.
Around the world. Come on.

687
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:43,396
-Who do you like?
-I like de Soto.

688
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:46,377
-De Soto? What did he do?
-Discovered the Mississippi.

689
00:35:46,572 --> 00:35:48,961
Oh, like they wouldn't have found
that anyway.

690
00:35:51,563 --> 00:35:53,865
All right. I gotta go down
to the unemployment office.

691
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:56,515
-You want to take a walk?
-No, I got some stuff to do.

692
00:35:56,684 --> 00:35:59,531
I gotta meet Keith at my apartment
at 3. Im helping him move.

693
00:35:59,915 --> 00:36:01,322
What?

694
00:36:02,187 --> 00:36:05,057
The guy asked you to help him move?
Wow!

695
00:36:05,227 --> 00:36:08,391
-I know. Isnt that something?
-Why doesn't he just pay a mover?

696
00:36:08,555 --> 00:36:12,167
He's got some valuable antiques.
He's worried they'll break something.

697
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:14,978
Soon he'll have you driving him
to the airport.

698
00:36:15,146 --> 00:36:17,601
Im not driving him to the airport!

699
00:36:22,154 --> 00:36:24,520
I gave. I gave everything I could,
Mrs. Sokol.

700
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,398
-Nothing was good enough for her.
-Sign here, please.

701
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:30,180
I don't know who she's looking for.
I don't know.

702
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:33,607
Ill tell you, she's very particular,
your daughter. Very particular.

703
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,842
Is she looking for some
big hotshot businessman?

704
00:36:36,009 --> 00:36:38,464
Well, Ive got my pride too.
Im not gonna beg her.

705
00:36:38,633 --> 00:36:41,284
All right. Just sign it.
People are waiting.

706
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,250
You like baseball?

707
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:52,483
That was autographed
by the '86 Mets.

708
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:54,558
I saw every inning that year.

709
00:36:55,529 --> 00:36:59,620
Its funny, because I happen to be
very good friends with...

710
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:01,727
...Keith Hernandez.

711
00:37:01,897 --> 00:37:04,449
You know Keith Hernandez.

712
00:37:04,616 --> 00:37:05,991
Know him?

713
00:37:06,792 --> 00:37:08,734
Would you...like to meet him?

714
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:11,297
Oh, come on. Come on.

715
00:37:11,816 --> 00:37:14,664
I can produce Keith Hernandez,
right here...

716
00:37:15,304 --> 00:37:16,581
...within the hour.

717
00:37:16,808 --> 00:37:18,270
All right.

718
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:20,679
You got one hour.

719
00:37:22,056 --> 00:37:24,128
All right, Mrs. S.

720
00:37:24,904 --> 00:37:28,733
I and my good pal
Keith Hernandez...

721
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:30,785
...will be right back.

722
00:37:44,391 --> 00:37:47,009
1 2<i>9</i> West 81 st Street, and hurry.

723
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,204
Or not.

724
00:37:56,614 --> 00:37:59,003
You better bring your gloves.
Its freezing out there.

725
00:37:59,174 --> 00:38:03,036
It shouldn't take too long.
Id say maybe, oh, four hours.

726
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:07,776
Really, Jerry, there's not that much.
First, we got the bedroom.

727
00:38:07,942 --> 00:38:09,949
We got two dressers and the bed.

728
00:38:10,566 --> 00:38:13,380
-Is there a box spring?
-What's that?

729
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,549
-A box spring?
-Yeah, there's a box spring.

730
00:38:15,717 --> 00:38:19,066
But it's attached to the headboard,
and we'll have to take that apart.

731
00:38:19,237 --> 00:38:20,699
Then we got the couch.

732
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:23,935
-Is that a sectional?
-Yeah, 1 2 pieces.

733
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:27,679
-A marble coffee table.
-Is that a thick marble?

734
00:38:28,357 --> 00:38:30,430
Three inches thick.
Got it in Italy.

735
00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:34,142
But the big problem is gonna be
the convertible sofa.

736
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:35,967
When you move it,
it tends to open up...

737
00:38:36,133 --> 00:38:38,554
...so it's going to be difficult
getting it downstairs.

738
00:38:39,365 --> 00:38:41,055
Stairs?

739
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:45,595
-There's no elevator?
-No, it's a brownstone. Three floors.

740
00:38:49,987 --> 00:38:51,962
-Im sorry, I can't do this.
-What?

741
00:38:52,132 --> 00:38:54,685
I can't do it! I can't!
Its too soon.

742
00:38:54,851 --> 00:38:56,859
I don't know you.

743
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:01,249
I can't help you move, Im sorry.
I can't! I just can't.

744
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:12,351
-Hello.
-Hello.

745
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:15,582
Oh, you don't remember me.

746
00:39:17,795 --> 00:39:19,682
-No. Should l?
-Yeah, yeah, you should...

747
00:39:19,843 --> 00:39:21,785
...because I certainly remember you.

748
00:39:22,979 --> 00:39:24,735
Let me refresh your memory.

749
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:29,048
June 1 4th, 1 <i>9</i>8 7.

750
00:39:29,218 --> 00:39:32,349
Mets-Phillies. You made a big error.
Cost the Mets the game.

751
00:39:32,514 --> 00:39:34,653
Then you're coming up
the parking lot ramp.

752
00:39:34,818 --> 00:39:37,207
You said, ''Nice game, pretty boy.''

753
00:39:37,985 --> 00:39:41,214
-You remember.
-And then you spit on us.

754
00:39:41,377 --> 00:39:43,166
-Hey, I didn't spit at you.
-Yeah, right.

755
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,112
-No, no. Then who was it?
-Look, the way I remember it...

756
00:39:46,273 --> 00:39:49,175
...I was walking up the ramp.
I was upset about the game.

757
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:51,200
<i>That's when you called me</i>
<i>''pretty boy. ''

758
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:54,111
<i>Hey, that ticked me off.</i>
<i>I was turning to say something...

759
00:39:54,561 --> 00:39:56,154
<i>...and as I turned around...

760
00:39:56,449 --> 00:40:01,784
...I saw Roger McDowell behind
the bushes over by that gravelly road.

761
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,211
<i>Anyway, he was talking to someone,</i>
<i>and they were pointing at you.

762
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:11,318
<i>I tried to scream out,</i>
<i>but it was too late.

763
00:40:11,488 --> 00:40:12,949
<i>It was already on its way.

764
00:40:13,216 --> 00:40:14,329
I told you.

765
00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:20,767
-<i>It was McDowell.</i>
-<i>But why? Why McDowell?

766
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:24,471
Maybe because we were sitting
in the right-field stands...

767
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,941
...cursing at him in the bullpen
all game.

768
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,389
He must have caught a glimpse of us
when I poured that beer on his head.

769
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:34,906
-It was McDowell.
-Oh, boy.

770
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,188
-Look, Keith, we're sorry.
-Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier.

771
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,399
Guys, don't worry about it.

772
00:40:41,567 --> 00:40:44,502
-Well, I guess I better get going.
-What are you doing?

773
00:40:44,671 --> 00:40:47,038
-I gotta move.
-You want any help?

774
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:49,943
-Id love some. You sure?
-Id love to help you.

775
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:51,321
Yeah, me too!

776
00:40:51,487 --> 00:40:53,396
Okay, guys. We got to be careful
of one thing.

777
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:56,763
Some of the stuff is very fragile
We'll have to handle it like a baby.

778
00:40:56,926 --> 00:40:58,650
Hey, no sweat.

779
00:41:10,814 --> 00:41:11,991
Hello.

780
00:41:12,158 --> 00:41:14,744
Oh, hi, Elaine. What's going on?

781
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,470
No, he just left.

782
00:41:16,638 --> 00:41:18,132
You broke up with him?

783
00:41:18,302 --> 00:41:19,862
Me too!

784
00:41:21,661 --> 00:41:23,319
What happened?

785
00:41:23,485 --> 00:41:27,609
Oh, smoking. You know, you're like
going out with C. Everett Koop.

786
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,746
Me? No.
I couldn't go through with it.

787
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:32,916
I just didn't feel ready.

788
00:41:33,084 --> 00:41:34,972
So, what are you doing now?

789
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:36,730
Oh, great idea. Okay.

790
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:38,616
Ill meet you there in, like,
30 minutes.

791
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:40,374
Okay, bye.

792
00:41:41,149 --> 00:41:43,221
Keith! Keith!

793
00:41:43,388 --> 00:41:46,704
-What happened? Where's Keith?
-You just missed him. He just left.

794
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:49,595
What do you need him for?

795
00:41:50,172 --> 00:41:53,336
Keith! Keith! Up here!

796
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,060
Look, could you do me a favor?

797
00:41:55,228 --> 00:41:57,464
I need you to go to the
unemployment office with me!

798
00:41:58,139 --> 00:41:59,514
l-- Im Jerry's friend!

799
00:41:59,676 --> 00:42:01,530
The guy from the locker room!

800
00:42:01,691 --> 00:42:03,252
Im the chucker!

801
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,394
It'll take five minutes!

802
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:08,466
Wait! Wait!

803
00:42:21,147 --> 00:42:22,488
Well, Biff...

804
00:42:24,955 --> 00:42:26,329
...what's next?

805
00:42:27,483 --> 00:42:28,660
I don't know.

806
00:42:30,811 --> 00:42:32,501
Excuse me.

807
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:34,226
I was walking behind you, and you...

808
00:42:34,906 --> 00:42:36,565
...dropped your wallet.

809
00:42:40,026 --> 00:42:43,091
When you're moving,
your whole world becomes boxes.

810
00:42:43,257 --> 00:42:46,323
That's all you think about,
is boxes. Where are there boxes?

811
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,360
You just wander down the street,
going in and out of stores.

812
00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:52,529
''Are there boxes here?
Have you seen any boxes?''

813
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:55,959
I mean, you can't even talk to people
because you can't concentrate.

814
00:42:56,121 --> 00:42:59,121
''Shut up! Im looking for boxes!''

815
00:42:59,737 --> 00:43:02,770
So after a while, you become
really into it. You can smell them.

816
00:43:02,937 --> 00:43:04,431
You walk into a store:

817
00:43:04,601 --> 00:43:06,608
''There's boxes here.

818
00:43:06,777 --> 00:43:10,574
Don't tell me you don't have boxes.
Damn it! I can smell them!''

819
00:43:11,641 --> 00:43:12,819
You become, like, obsessed.

820
00:43:12,984 --> 00:43:15,984
'I love the smell of cardboard
in the morning.''

821
00:43:16,152 --> 00:43:19,283
At a funeral, everyone's crying around.
You're looking at the casket:

822
00:43:19,448 --> 00:43:21,139
''That's a nice box.

823
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,914
Does anybody know where
that guy got that box?

824
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,252
When he's done with it,
you think I could get that?

825
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:29,423
Its got some nice handles on it.''

826
00:43:29,784 --> 00:43:33,843
And that's what death is, really.
Its the last big move of your life.

827
00:43:34,008 --> 00:43:35,437
The hearse is like the van.

828
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:37,101
The pallbearers are close friends.

829
00:43:37,271 --> 00:43:40,500
The only ones you could really ask
to help you with a big move like that.

830
00:43:40,663 --> 00:43:42,670
And the casket is that great,
perfect box...

831
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:44,661
...you've been looking for
your whole life.

832
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:47,506
The only problem is
once you find it, you're in it.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
