1
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:05,501
Don't visualize your parents
having sex.

2
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:08,141
You know what I mean? It's somehow
very uncomfortable.

3
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:12,939
You know they had to have sex
at least once to have you.

4
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:15,708
But you still kind of maintain
the image in your head:

5
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:19,250
"Well, I don't know. I'm not positive.
I can't prove it.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,217
I don't know if that
actually happened."

7
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:24,415
That's why if I found I was adopted,
that would come as great news.

8
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:25,991
"I'm adopted? That's great."

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,492
I'd be happy to hear that.
That means technically...

10
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:33,726
...it's possible, that my mother and
father are just really great friends.

11
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,836
Sex is great, but you don't wanna
think your whole life began...

12
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,632
...because somebody had a little
too much wine with dinner.

13
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:47,937
Let me ask you a question.

14
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:50,412
You're a hostage captured
by terrorists.

15
00:00:50,585 --> 00:00:52,485
- Who, me?
- You, anybody. Whatever.

16
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:55,417
You're in the little room.
You're chained to the floor.

17
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,319
You're there for a long time.

18
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,755
Do you think they would consider
doing laundry?

19
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,861
They have to.
It's in the Geneva Convention.

20
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:04,827
You. Take off your socks
and pants. We're doing the wash.

21
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:07,467
Come on. Take it off.
Take it off.

22
00:01:08,102 --> 00:01:10,627
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hi.

23
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,202
What's the matter?

24
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,977
My mother caught me.

25
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:20,280
Caught you? Doing what?

26
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,209
You know.

27
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,753
I was alone...

28
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,452
You mean...?

29
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:32,650
- She caught you?
- Where?

30
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:36,385
I stopped by the house
to drop the car off...

31
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,429
...and I went inside
for a few minutes.

32
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,726
Nobody was there.
They're supposed to be working.

33
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:45,966
My mother had a Glamour magazine.
I started leafing through it.

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,964
Glamour?

35
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:52,203
- So one thing led to another.
- What did she do?

36
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,248
First she screams, "George, what are
you doing? My God!"

37
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,818
Looked like she was gonna faint.

38
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:01,921
She started clutching the wall,
trying to hang onto it.

39
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,990
I didn't know whether to keep her
from falling or zip up.

40
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:08,054
- What did you do?
- I zipped up.

41
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,094
- So she fell?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,263
Well, I couldn't run over there
the way I was.

43
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,925
- No, I guess you couldn't.
- I wouldn't think so.

44
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:20,130
So she fell, and then she starts
screaming, "My back, my back!"

45
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,275
I picked her up. I took her
to the hospital.

46
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,877
- How is she?
- She's in traction.

47
00:02:26,047 --> 00:02:27,708
- I'm sorry.
- It's not funny, Elaine.

48
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:30,578
I know. I'm sorry. It's serious.

49
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:34,016
Her back went out. She's gotta be
there for a couple of days.

50
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:39,125
All she said on the way over
in the car was, "Why, George, why?"

51
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:41,784
I said, "Because it's there."

52
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:45,188
Glamour?

53
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,599
I'll tell you this, though:

54
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,760
I am never doing...

55
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,735
...that again.

56
00:02:52,907 --> 00:02:55,398
What? You mean in your mother's
house or altogether?

57
00:02:55,576 --> 00:02:58,044
- Altogether.
- Give me a break.

58
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:59,770
Yeah, right.

59
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,744
- You don't think I can?
- No chance.

60
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:06,750
- You think you could?
- I could hold out longer than you.

61
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,889
Care to make it interesting?

62
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:12,423
Sure. How much?

63
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:13,821
Hundred dollars?

64
00:03:13,994 --> 00:03:15,427
You're on.

65
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:18,724
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Count me in on this.

66
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:22,491
You? You'll be out before we
get the check.

67
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,466
I want in on this.

68
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,439
- No, no.
- It's apples and oranges.

69
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,941
- It's different.
- Why? Why?

70
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:32,773
- Because you're a woman.
- So what?

71
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:36,747
It's easier for a woman not to do it
than a man. We have to do it.

72
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:39,579
It's part of our lifestyle.

73
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:42,145
It's like shaving.

74
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:45,458
That is such baloney.
I shave my legs.

75
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:46,991
Not every day.

76
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:50,787
- You wanna be in?
- Yeah.

77
00:03:50,965 --> 00:03:54,128
You gotta give us odds.
At least 2-1. You gotta put up $200.

78
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:56,360
No. A thousand.

79
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:59,028
No. I'll put up 150.

80
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:02,232
- All right. You're in for 150.
- Okay, 150.

81
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,706
How we gonna monitor this?

82
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,539
Obviously, we all know each
other very well.

83
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:12,277
I'm sure we'll all feel comfortable within
the confines of the honor system.

84
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,555
All right. Come on.

85
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:24,426
No, Ma. I'm not gonna
see a psychiatrist.

86
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:27,198
I don't care if you do pay for it.

87
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:29,302
No. Discussion over.

88
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,335
Yeah, all right. I'll see you later.

89
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,167
Yes, of course I'm gonna come by.

90
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:36,400
All right.

91
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:39,478
My mother wants me
to see a psychiatrist now.

92
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,741
Why? Because she caught me?

93
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:47,251
You know, if everyone who did
that had to go see a psychiatrist...

94
00:04:52,026 --> 00:04:53,254
Yeah...?

95
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,227
Whatever.

96
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,298
- How is she?
- She'll be fine.

97
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,059
I gotta go see her at the hospital.

98
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,362
- Yeah?
- It's me.

99
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:04,765
Come on up.

100
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:07,669
- Hey, what are you doing tonight?
- Date with Marla.

101
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:09,833
- Oh, the virgin?
- Yeah.

102
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:12,579
Any progress there?
What's the latest?

103
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:14,941
I got my troops amassed
along the border.

104
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:17,413
I'm waiting for someone to give me
the go-ahead.

105
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,113
Hey, look at this. Come here. There's
a naked woman across the street.

106
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,156
Where?

107
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:25,724
Second floor from the top.
See the window on the left?

108
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,190
Who walks around
the house like that?

109
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:32,196
Maybe she's a nudist. You know those
nudist-colony people.

110
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,095
Yeah.

111
00:05:34,268 --> 00:05:35,633
Yeah.

112
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,370
Let me ask you,
in these nudist colonies...

113
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,344
...do they eat naked
in the dining room?

114
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,039
I would imagine it's all naked.

115
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,946
Are the chambermaids naked too?

116
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:55,054
They're naked. The gardener's naked.
Bellhops.

117
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:57,247
It's one big nude-o-rama.

118
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:01,289
- Hey.
- Hey.

119
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,987
Well, where's my money?
Who caved?

120
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,961
- Not me.
- Not me.

121
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,931
- What are you looking at?
- A naked woman across the street.

122
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:13,667
This is gonna be the easiest
money I've ever made in my life.

123
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,137
My friend Joyce is teaching an
aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.

124
00:06:17,311 --> 00:06:20,178
Yeah, well, the waitress
should've taken it back.

125
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:30,321
Then, I got a call this morning. I was
chosen to go on the space shuttle.

126
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,389
- We're going to Mars.
- Have a good time.

127
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,156
I'm out.

128
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,602
What?

129
00:06:54,048 --> 00:06:56,778
Yeah, I'm out.
I'm out of the contest.

130
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,612
- You're out?
- Yeah.

131
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:02,278
Wow, that was fast.

132
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:05,118
Well, it was that woman
across the street.

133
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:08,284
You know, you better be careful,
buddy. She'll get you next.

134
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,532
And then there were three.

135
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:20,002
I don't understand you. I really don't.

136
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:25,701
You have nothing better to do
at 3:00 in the afternoon?

137
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:29,079
I go out for a quart of milk.

138
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:31,843
I come home and find
my son treating his body...

139
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:34,419
...like it was an amusement park.

140
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,384
Ma...

141
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:40,186
Don't give me "Ma." It's good
I didn't hit the table.

142
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:42,329
I could have cracked my head open.

143
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,664
People can hear you.

144
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,697
Too bad you can't do that
for a living.

145
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,835
You'd be very successful at it.

146
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,840
You could sell out
Madison Square Garden.

147
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,240
Thousands of people
could watch you.

148
00:07:58,412 --> 00:08:00,346
You could be a big star.

149
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,744
All right. That's enough.

150
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,508
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.

151
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,710
No! I am not going
to see a psychiatrist!

152
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:09,355
- Why not? Why won't you go?
- Because I don't want to.

153
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:13,654
- I want you to go see somebody.
- Well, I am not going.

154
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,727
It's a good thing
your father's in Chicago.

155
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,194
Hello, Aunt Estelle.

156
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,593
Look at you.

157
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:23,168
- How did this happen?
- Is that important, really?

158
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,101
What is this, a police investigation?
She's been through enough.

159
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:27,900
She has to relive the experience?

160
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,310
Hi, Denise. 6:30, time for
your sponge bath.

161
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:35,875
Is it 6:30 already? I fell asleep.

162
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,018
So, George...

163
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,592
...what are you doing now?

164
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,093
I hear you got some kind of
television writing thing.

165
00:08:50,264 --> 00:08:51,629
Yeah. Television.

166
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,859
Let me help you off with that.
Here, just slip it over your head.

167
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,232
Well, it's about time.

168
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:02,273
We thought you were gonna
wind up on the street.

169
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,836
So...

170
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:11,212
...what is it you're doing, exactly?

171
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:17,781
George, your cousin Shelly
is talking to you!

172
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:25,457
So when was the last time
you took a class?

173
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:27,759
- It's been a while.
- Are you psyched?

174
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,632
Yeah. I'm really psyched.

175
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,795
You're gonna thank me
for getting you in here.

176
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,271
- Why is that?
- See the guy with the dark hair...

177
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,672
...and the red shorts?

178
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,440
Oh, my God.

179
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,775
John F. Kennedy Jr. is here.

180
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,612
- He's gonna be in your class today.
- In my class?

181
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,344
John Kennedy's gonna
be in my class?

182
00:09:47,521 --> 00:09:49,682
I can get you a spot
right behind him.

183
00:09:49,857 --> 00:09:52,325
He has got a great butt.

184
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:56,862
Yeah. Butt, butt.
Great butt. John-John's butt.

185
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,159
- Let's slow it down a little.
- Slow it down?

186
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:06,533
Well, you know.

187
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,505
Yeah. I know.

188
00:10:10,878 --> 00:10:12,937
You're okay with that, right?

189
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,546
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

190
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:18,742
You think I care about the sex? What
kind of person do you think I am?

191
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:21,649
That doesn't mean anything to me.
I don't care about that.

192
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,449
I'll see you Saturday night, then?

193
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,558
Sure. Saturday night.

194
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:28,820
- All right, then. Good night.
- Good night.

195
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:30,591
Not just a good night.

196
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:33,028
A great night.

197
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,794
Good morning.

198
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,890
Yeah, good morning.

199
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:09,399
Nothing like some good,
solid sack-time.

200
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,060
She's not there.

201
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,796
She's doing her wash.

202
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,703
So did you make it
through the night?

203
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,706
Yes, I'm proud to say I did.

204
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,344
So you're still master
of your domain.

205
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,710
Yes. Yes, I am.

206
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:26,079
Master of my domain.

207
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,220
But I will tell you this:

208
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:30,117
I am going over to her apartment...

209
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,622
...and I'm telling her to put
those shades down.

210
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,260
Wait. What did you just say?

211
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:36,453
I can't take it anymore.

212
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,359
She's driving me crazy.
I can't sleep.

213
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:40,760
I can't leave the house.
I'm climbing walls.

214
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,799
I'm dating a virgin,
I'm in this contest.

215
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,063
Something's gotta give.

216
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:50,641
Do you hear what you're saying?
Can you hear it?

217
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,972
This is a beautiful woman
walking around naked...

218
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:54,738
...and you wanna tell her to stop?

219
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:57,475
That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard!

220
00:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,482
It's incomprehensible...
I won't let you.

221
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:02,247
- I'm doing it. Get out of my way.
- No, no. You can't.

222
00:12:02,422 --> 00:12:05,357
This is something that comes about
once in a lifetime.

223
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,789
When we were boys looking through
our windows...

224
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:11,089
...we'd think, "Why can't a woman
out there take her clothes off?"

225
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:14,132
Now that wish has come true,
and you wanna throw it away?

226
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,199
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not gonna let you do it.

227
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:19,305
- Kramer, get out of my way.
- Don't do it.

228
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:23,136
For my sake. God knows,
I don't ask you for much.

229
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:27,713
Please, Jerry. I'm begging you.
Please! Come on! Please!

230
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,919
- All right, all right.
- Yes!

231
00:12:34,788 --> 00:12:36,949
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

232
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,048
She's not there.

233
00:12:40,227 --> 00:12:42,559
Oh, I can wait.

234
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:48,827
The nurse was giving her
a sponge bath?

235
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,869
Every night at 6:30.

236
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,802
The nurse was gorgeous.

237
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:56,272
Then I got a look at the patient.

238
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,738
I was going nuts.

239
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,337
I guess you'll be going back
to that hospital.

240
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,416
Well, my mother, Jerry.

241
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:07,517
But are you still
master of your domain?

242
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,455
I am king of the county.

243
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,718
- You?
- Lord of the manor.

244
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,529
John F. Kennedy Jr.

245
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,463
What?

246
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,003
He was in my aerobics class.

247
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:28,141
Really? Did you talk to him?

248
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:32,972
No, you don't understand.
He was working out in front of me.

249
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,740
After the class was over,
I timed my walk to the door...

250
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,043
...so we'd get there
at the exact same moment.

251
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:41,517
And he says to me,
"Quite a workout."

252
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,656
"Quite a workout"?

253
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,691
- What did you say?
- I said, "Yeah."

254
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:48,789
Good one.

255
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,759
Listen, listen. Then I showered,
and I dressed...

256
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,866
...and I saw him again
on the way out.

257
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:57,834
So we're walking and talking,
and he asked me my name...

258
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:01,132
...and I think I said Elaine,
but I mean, who the hell knows?

259
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:04,300
So then he says to me:

260
00:14:04,478 --> 00:14:08,778
"Do you wanna split
a cab uptown?"

261
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:12,241
And I said, "Sure," even though
I was going downtown.

262
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:17,789
So we get in the cab, and I mean,
I have no idea where I'm going, right?

263
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:21,291
But this is John F. Kennedy Jr.
we're talking about.

264
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,053
So he says, "Where do you live?"

265
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,630
I was close to your block,
so I said your building.

266
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:27,289
He dropped me off in front...

267
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:31,767
...and then I had to take a cab all
the way back downtown to my house.

268
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:33,533
Oh, God.

269
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,641
The question is...

270
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:38,371
...are you still master
of your domain?

271
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,840
I'm queen of the castle.

272
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:51,750
You're back.

273
00:14:51,925 --> 00:14:53,552
Of course I'm back.

274
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,285
Why wouldn't I be back?

275
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:58,556
My mother is in the hospital.
I'm gonna pay her a visit.

276
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,064
I know, but two days in a row?

277
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,792
You didn't have to do this.

278
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:06,928
You're my mother.
What wouldn't I do for you?

279
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,335
You know what you could do?

280
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,840
I haven't eaten lunch or dinner.

281
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:13,275
I can't eat this hospital food.

282
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:16,939
Maybe you could run down to the deli
and get me a sandwich.

283
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:19,384
You got it, Ma.

284
00:15:19,553 --> 00:15:21,282
A little later.

285
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:27,054
Could you go now, Georgie?
I'm very hungry. I'm weak.

286
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,990
Wait a while. What's the difference?

287
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:32,495
I don't understand why
you can't do this for me!

288
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,658
I just got here, Ma. I'd like to spend
a little time with you.

289
00:15:35,836 --> 00:15:37,929
But if you wait, they won't
let you back in!

290
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,129
Visiting hours are almost over!

291
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:43,970
Ten minutes. Here.
Have some Tic Tacs.

292
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,045
Get the hell out of here.

293
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,012
I'm sorry you came.

294
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,175
6:30. Time for your bath.

295
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:02,456
George. I'm hungry.

296
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:05,964
Hang on, Ma. Hang on.

297
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,840
- Hi.
- Hi.

298
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,532
Did you get your hair done today?

299
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:21,045
No, I just fixed it a little bit.

300
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:23,205
You-know-who isn't here.

301
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:25,544
He was in the early class today,
but I think...

302
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:28,210
...you made quite an impression
on him yesterday.

303
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,879
What? What? Who? Me?

304
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,957
- What impression?
- Let me put this back.

305
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,924
No, no, now! Tell me now!
What did he say?

306
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,996
- He asked about you.
- He asked about me?

307
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,530
John Kennedy asked about me?
What did he say?

308
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,258
He wanted to know your situation.

309
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,801
- What? I have a situation?
- I said you were single.

310
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:48,134
- That was good. That was very good.
- He said you were just his type.

311
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:52,608
Okay. You're trying to hurt me?
You're trying to injure me?

312
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:56,738
He told me to tell you he'll be in your
neighborhood tomorrow around 9:00.

313
00:16:56,917 --> 00:17:00,580
He'll stop in front of your building if
you wanna come down and say hello.

314
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:07,487
All right, Ma.
I'll talk to you later.

315
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:12,394
Nothing. I'm watching
Tiny Toons here on Nickelodeon.

316
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:16,002
I like kids' shows. They have a very
innocent, wholesome quality.

317
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,660
Okay. All right, talk to you later. Bye.

318
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:22,771
Yeah, that's good. That's good.
That's very, very good.

319
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,968
It's hot in there, so just walk around.

320
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:28,979
Yeah. Don't be ashamed.
Don't be ashamed. That's good.

321
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,117
Yes, yes, yes.

322
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:38,420
The woman across the block
Has nothing on

323
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:40,150
Nothing on, nothing on

324
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,455
The woman across the block
Has nothing on, nothing on

325
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:44,790
All through the day

326
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:05,375
All you got is instant coffee?
Why don't you get some real coffee?

327
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:09,545
I don't keep real coffee here.
I get my coffee on the outside.

328
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:12,154
Yeah!

329
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,759
- It's Elaine.
- Come on up!

330
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,762
- Where did you get those socks?
- I don't know.

331
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,489
- I think those are my socks.
- How are these your socks?

332
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:22,464
I don't know, but those are my socks.

333
00:18:22,636 --> 00:18:26,163
I had a blue-striped pair just like that,
and now I don't have them anymore.

334
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:30,036
Yeah, you fell asleep on the sofa,
and I took them off your stinking feet!

335
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,144
They looked so good,
I had to have them!

336
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:34,644
- Well, they're my socks!
- They're my socks!

337
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,309
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
- What are we doing here?

338
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:41,181
- This is ridiculous.
- You believe this? We're fighting.

339
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:43,584
I haven't been myself.
I've snapped at everybody.

340
00:18:43,757 --> 00:18:45,657
I'm yelling at strangers
on the street.

341
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:51,857
Hello.

342
00:18:58,538 --> 00:18:59,766
You caved?

343
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:02,237
- It's over?
- You're out?

344
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:06,709
Oh, my God.
The queen is dead.

345
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:11,176
I figured you'd cruise,
at least through the spring.

346
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:14,120
- What happened?
- It was...

347
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,082
...John-John.

348
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,225
- John-John.
- John-John.

349
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,088
But you made it through
the day before.

350
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:27,290
But he told Joyce that he wants to
meet me outside here at 9:00 tonight.

351
00:19:27,467 --> 00:19:30,061
- Why outside here?
- Because he thinks I live here.

352
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:33,262
Remember the cab? He dropped me off
out front. He's picking me up.

353
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,933
All right, Costanza...

354
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,337
...it's you and me.

355
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:41,139
And then, there were two.

356
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,239
Elaine Benes...

357
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:47,113
...Kennedy Jr.

358
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:57,228
Let's go in the bedroom.

359
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,456
- Really?
- Yes.

360
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,532
- You sure?
- Yes.

361
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,636
- You really want to?
- I do. I'm ready.

362
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:06,199
Okay.

363
00:20:06,473 --> 00:20:09,465
I know how difficult this
must have been for you.

364
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,405
You don't know the half of it.

365
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:16,713
- What do you mean?
- It's kind of silly, but...

366
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:24,950
Contest? A contest?

367
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,150
This is what you do
with your friends?

368
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:30,353
It was just a bet. It actually started
with George and his mother.

369
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,794
I don't wanna hear
another word!

370
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:35,958
To think how close I came to you
being the one!

371
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:38,661
I must have been out of my mind.

372
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:54,114
Marla.

373
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:56,278
Hi.
I'm glad I ran into you.

374
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:59,789
I don't wanna have anything to do
with you or your perverted friends.

375
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:05,561
Get away from me.
You're horrible, horrible. All of you.

376
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:10,536
- What happened?
- I told her about the contest.

377
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,695
Boy. She's a wacko.

378
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,307
- Hey, what happened?
- What?

379
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:18,341
- You were meeting Kennedy.
- He didn't show.

380
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:19,773
Yeah, he did.

381
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,005
What? He's out there?

382
00:21:22,182 --> 00:21:24,650
- Oh, my God. I gotta go.
- No, no, he just left.

383
00:21:25,418 --> 00:21:28,182
- What?
- He was talking to Marla.

384
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:29,616
Marla?

385
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,781
She was, like, crying.
He was consoling her.

386
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:35,826
She got into his car,
and they just drove away.

387
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:41,099
- He left with Marla, the virgin?
- Yeah.

388
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:44,036
- They drove away?
- Yeah, drove away.

389
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:49,870
- You know, I said hello to him. He's...
- Oh, my God in heaven.

390
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:54,305
Is that...?

391
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,380
Kramer?

392
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,649
He's waving.

393
00:22:22,475 --> 00:22:24,602
Oh, John...

394
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:27,507
...that was wonderful.

395
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,658
Men wanna see women naked.

396
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:41,589
Whatever it is you won't show us...

397
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:44,093
...that's what we're obsessed
with seeing.

398
00:22:44,264 --> 00:22:47,665
If women always wore hats in public,
all the time...

399
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,802
...you'd see men buying
Playhead magazine...

400
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,301
...you know, Skulls of the Big 10.

401
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:54,667
This would be what we're
interested in.

402
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:57,105
What about cultures, like in
National Geographic...

403
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,335
...where everybody is naked?

404
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:02,948
What are men in these cultures trying
to look at when the women walk by?

405
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,913
How could you have a strip
club there?

406
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:08,952
Woman takes off the necklace and
the nose ring, that's it, show's over.

407
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:13,548
The men are going, "Boy, did you see
that little indentation in her lip?

408
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,887
I told you, man, this place is hot!"
