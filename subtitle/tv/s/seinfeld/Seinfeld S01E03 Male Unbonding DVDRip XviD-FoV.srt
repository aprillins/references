1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,300
Most men like working on things.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,800
Tools, objects, fixing things.
This is what men enjoy doing.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,400
Ever noticed if a guy's in his driveway
working on something with tools...

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
...how all the other men
in the neighbourhood...

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,100
...are magnetically drawn
to this activity?

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,600
They just come wandering out
of the house like zombies.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,100
Men... It's true. Men hear a drill,
it's like a dog whistle. Just:

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,100
They go running up
to the living-room curtain.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,700
"Honey, I think Jim's working
on something over there."

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,700
So they run over to the guy.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,500
They don't actually help the guy.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,800
No. They just want to hang
around the area...

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,200
...where work is being done.

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,000
That's what men want to do.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,400
We want to watch the guy.
We want to talk to him.

16
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,300
We want to ask him dumb questions.
You know...

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,400
"What are you using,
a Phillips head?"

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,500
You know, we feel involved.

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,700
That's why when they have
construction sites...

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,200
...they have to have those wood
panel fences around it.

21
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,000
That's just to keep the men out.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,800
They cut those little holes for us...

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,500
...so we can see
what the hell is going on.

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,400
But if they don't cut those holes,
we are climbing those fences.

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,200
Right over there. "What are you using,
the steel girders down here?"

26
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,600
Yeah, that'll hold.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,400
I had to say something.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,400
Had to say something.

29
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,200
Everything was going so well.
I had to say something.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,900
I don't think you did
anything wrong.

31
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,500
I told her I liked her. Why?

32
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,200
Why did I tell her I like her?

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,400
I have this sick compulsion
to tell women how I feel.

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,300
I like you. I don't tell you.

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
We can only thank God for that.

36
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,600
I'm out of the picture.
I am out of the picture.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,900
Matter of time now.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,900
- You're imagining this. Really.
- Oh, no. No, no.

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
I'll tell you when it happened too.

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,600
It's when that floss came
flying out of my pocket.

41
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,700
What floss? When?

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,900
In the lobby, during
the intermission of the play.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,500
I was buying her one of those
containers of orange drink.

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,400
For $5.

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,400
I reach into my pocket
to pay for it. I look down.

46
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,400
There's this piece of green floss
hanging from my fingers.

47
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,200
- Mint.
- Of course.

48
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,400
So I'm looking at it.
I look up and see she's looking at it.

49
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,300
Our eyes lock.

50
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,500
It was a horrible moment. I just...

51
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
So let me get this straight.
She saw the floss.

52
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,100
You panicked, and you told her
you liked her.

53
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,900
If I didn't put floss in my pocket...

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
...l'd be crawling around her bedroom
right now, looking for my glasses.

55
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,100
- You sure the floss was the catalyst?
- Yes, I am.

56
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,300
You don't think it might have
had anything to do with that?

57
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,600
What, you don't like this?

58
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,700
Looks like your belt is digesting
a small animal.

59
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,400
They got a cure for cancer.
See, it's all big business.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,400
Oh, hey! Jerry just walked in.

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,200
Hi, George!

62
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Take my number.

63
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,700
It's 555-8643.

64
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,800
Okay. Here he is.

65
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,100
- Who is it?
- Take it.

66
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,600
- Who is it?
- It's for you.

67
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,400
Hello?

68
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,100
Oh, hi, Joel.

69
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,100
No. I was out of town.
I just got back.

70
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,500
Kramer doesn't know anything.
He's just my next-door neighbour.

71
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,600
Nothing much. Tuesday?

72
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,100
Tuesday, no.
I'm meeting somebody.

73
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,700
Wednesday?

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,700
Wednesday's okay. All right.

75
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm a little busy right now.
Can we talk Wednesday morning?

76
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,100
Okay. Yeah.

77
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,800
Right. Thanks. Bye.

78
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,900
Why do you put me
on the phone with him?

79
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,200
I hate just being handed a phone.

80
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,500
Well, it's your phone.
He wanted to talk to you.

81
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,600
Maybe I didn't want to talk to him.

82
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,600
- Well, why not?
- He bothers me.

83
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,800
I don't answer the phone anymore
because of him.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,300
He's turned me into a screener.

85
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,200
Now I gotta see him on Wednesday.

86
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,800
What? I thought we had tickets
to the Knick game Wednesday.

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,300
We got seats behind the bench.

88
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,800
- What happened? We're not going?
- We're going.

89
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
That's next Wednesday.

90
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,100
- Who is this guy?
- His name's Joel Horneck.

91
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,800
He lived, like, three houses down
from me when I grew up.

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,900
He had a Ping-Pong table.
We were friends.

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,300
Should I suffer the rest of my life
because I like to play Ping-Pong?

94
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,600
I was 10!

95
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,200
I would've been friends with Stalin
if he had a Ping-Pong table.

96
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,800
He's so self-involved.

97
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,000
That's for me.

98
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,300
Kramerica Industries.

99
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,200
Hi, Mark.

100
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,700
No, no. Forget that.
I got a better idea.

101
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,800
A pizza place where you make
your own pie.

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,600
Can you conduct your business...

103
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,200
...elsewhere?
- No, I'm talking about a whole chain.

104
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,300
Yeah.

105
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,300
I don't know why you bother
with this Ping-Pong guy, I tell you.

106
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,600
I don't bother with him.

107
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,700
He's been calling me for seven years.
I never called him once.

108
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,400
He's got the attention span
of a 5-year-old.

109
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,000
Sometimes I sit there...

110
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,900
...and I make up things just to see
if he's paying attention.

111
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,400
I don't understand why
you spend time with this guy.

112
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,700
What can I do, break up with him?

113
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,900
Tell him, " I don't think we're right
for each other."

114
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,800
It's a guy.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,900
At least with a woman
there's a precedent.

116
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,000
The relationship goes sour,
you end it.

117
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,300
No, no, no. You have to approach
this as if he was a woman.

118
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,800
- Just break up with him?
- Absolutely.

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
- You just tell him the truth.
- The truth?

120
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,800
No. As a guy, I don't know how
I can break up with another guy.

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,800
You know?
I don't know how to say:

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,600
"Bill, I feel I need to see other men."

123
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,200
Know what I mean?
There is nothing I can do.

124
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,600
I have to wait for someone to die.

125
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,600
I think that's the only way
out of this relationship.

126
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,000
It could be a long time.

127
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,200
See the great thing about guys
is that we can become friends...

128
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,400
...based on almost nothing.

129
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,700
Just two guys will just become friends
just because they're two guys.

130
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,400
That's almost all we need
to have in common.

131
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,200
Because sports and women
is really all we talk about.

132
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,300
If there was no sports and no women,
the only thing guys would say is:

133
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,600
"So, what's in the refrigerator?"

134
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,300
So my shrink wants me to bring
my mother in for a session.

135
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,300
I mean, this guy is a brilliant man.

136
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,100
Lenny Bruce used to go to him...

137
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,900
...and I think, Geraldo.

138
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,700
I read the Lenny Bruce biography.
I thought it was...

139
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,400
Hey, hey, hey! We're starving here!

140
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,900
...interesting...
- We've been waiting here 10 minutes.

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,500
...that he would...

142
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,000
So I'm thinking about going
to Iran this summer.

143
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,000
You know, I have to eat.

144
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
I mean, I'm hypoglycaemic.

145
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,500
Anyway, the Hezbollah
has invited me to perform.

146
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,800
- It's their annual terrorist luncheon.
- Yeah.

147
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,200
I'm gonna do it in Farsi.

148
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,000
Do you think I need a haircut?

149
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,500
Are you ready?

150
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah, I'll have the egg salad
on whole wheat.

151
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,500
Hey, let me ask you a question.
This turkey sandwich here...

152
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
...is that real turkey
or is it a turkey roll?

153
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,400
I don't want that processed turkey.

154
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,300
I hate it.

155
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,800
I think it's real turkey.

156
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,800
- Is there a real bird in the back?
- No, there's no bird, but...

157
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,500
How do you know for sure?
Why don't you do me a favour.

158
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,700
Why don't you go in the back
and find out, okay?

159
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Unbelievable.

160
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,000
How can you talk
to someone like that?

161
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,700
Look, what are you saying?
What, you like turkey roll?

162
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,000
Listen, Joel. There's something
I have to tell you.

163
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,200
Wait.

164
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,800
You'll never guess who I ran into.

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,200
- Howard Metro.
- Howard Metro.

166
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,400
He asked me if I still saw you.
I said, "Sure, I see him all the time.

167
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,600
We're still great friends."
Anyway, Howard says hello.

168
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,200
Listen, Joel.

169
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

170
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,000
What?

171
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,600
This friendship, it's not working.

172
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,700
Not working?
What are you talking about?

173
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,400
We're just not suited to be friends.

174
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,400
- But how can you say that?
- Look, you're a nice guy.

175
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,000
It's just that we don't have
anything in common.

176
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,000
Wait. What did I do?

177
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Tell me what...
I want to know what I did.

178
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,700
You didn't do anything.
It's not you. It's me.

179
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,500
It's... This is very difficult.

180
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,300
Look, I know I call you too much.
Right? I mean, I know.

181
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,200
- You're a very busy guy.
- No, it's not that.

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,200
You're one of the few people
I can talk to.

183
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,800
Look, come on.
Now, that's not true.

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,800
I always tell everybody about you.

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,700
I tell everybody to go see his show!

186
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,900
I mean, I'm your biggest fan.

187
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,400
- I know, I know.
- I mean, you're my best friend.

188
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,400
Best friend? I've never been
to your apartment.

189
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,200
I cannot believe that this
is happening! I can't believe it.

190
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:48,700
Okay, okay, forget it.
It's okay. I didn't mean it.

191
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,600
- Didn't mean what?
- What I said.

192
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,000
- I've been under a lot of stress.
- Oh, you've been under a lot of stress.

193
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,700
Look, just... Can we just forget
the whole thing ever happened?

194
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,100
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
I took it out on you.

195
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,000
We're still friends.
We're still friends. Still friends.

196
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,300
Okay, look. I tell you what.
I got Knick tickets. This Wednesday.

197
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,800
Great seats behind the bench.
You want to come with me?

198
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,600
Come on.

199
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,100
Tonight?

200
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,900
No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight,
I would've said tonight.

201
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,800
You really want me to go?

202
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes.

203
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,900
- Okay.
- Here, take these.

204
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,200
Okay. Great. That would be...

205
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,700
That'd be great. So...

206
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,800
...next Wednesday.
- Next Wednesday.

207
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,600
Say, where is that waitress? Hey!

208
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,400
She calls me up at the office.
She says, "We have to talk."

209
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,500
The four worst words
in the English language.

210
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,200
That or, "Whose bra is this?"

211
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,100
That is worse.

212
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,400
So we order lunch,
and we're talking.

213
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
Finally, she blurts out
how it's not working.

214
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,800
Really.

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,800
So, I'm thinking, as she's saying this,
I'm thinking, "Great.

216
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,600
The relationship's over,
but the egg salad's on the way."

217
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,600
So now I have a decision.
Do I walk or do I eat?

218
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,600
You ate.

219
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,700
Sat there for 20 minutes, chewing.

220
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,600
Staring at each other
in a defunct relationship.

221
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,400
Someone says,
"Get out of my life."

222
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,000
And that doesn't affect
your appetite?

223
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,800
Have you ever had
their egg salad?

224
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,600
- It is unbelievable.
- It's unbelievable.

225
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,300
Tell you what else is unbelievable.
I picked up the check.

226
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,600
She didn't even offer.
She ended it.

227
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,700
The least she could do is
send me off with a sandwich.

228
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,400
How much could you
possibly have in there?

229
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,000
Look, it's my money.

230
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,400
All right? What should I do,
throw it out the window?

231
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,000
I know a guy who took
his vacation on his change.

232
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Yeah? Where'd he go?
To an arcade?

233
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,200
That's funny. You're a funny guy.

234
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,500
Come on, move up.

235
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,200
Great. Ewing's hurt.

236
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,600
How long is he gonna be out?

237
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Well, a couple days
at the most, but...

238
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,000
- Oh, God.
- I got scared there for a second.

239
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,300
The Knicks without Ewing.

240
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,200
Listen, George.
A little problem with the game.

241
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,200
- What about it?
- The thing is, yesterday...

242
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,600
...I kind of...

243
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,900
- What?
- I gave your ticket to Horneck.

244
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,200
- You what?
- Yeah.

245
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,800
I'm sorry.
I had to give it to Horneck.

246
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,700
No.

247
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,600
My ticket?

248
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,400
- You gave my ticket to Horneck?
- Come on. Go ahead. Move up.

249
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,000
What did you give him
my ticket for?

250
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,800
You didn't see him.
It was horrible.

251
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,100
Oh, come on, Jerry.
I can't believe this!

252
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,900
- I had to do it.
- Oh, please.

253
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,500
Can you change this into bills?

254
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,400
I'm sorry, sir, we can't do that.

255
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,000
Do you want to go with him?

256
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
- You go, I don't mind.
- I'm not going with him!

257
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,900
I don't even know the guy!

258
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
Look, they did this for me before.

259
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,800
Look, I can give you these,
and you can roll them yourself.

260
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,400
You want me to roll 6000 of these?

261
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,900
What, should I quit my job?

262
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,200
No, I do not like the bank.
I've heard the expression:

263
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,600
"Laughing all the way to the bank."
I've never seen anyone actually do it.

264
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,000
And those bank lines.

265
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
I hate it when there's
nobody on the line at all.

266
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,200
You now that part?
You go to the bank, it's empty...

267
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,300
...and you still have to go
through the little maze.

268
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,400
"Could you get some cheese for me?
I'm almost at the front.

269
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,200
I'd like a reward for this, please."

270
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,600
- Thirty-two, 33...
- George.

271
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,900
Not now, 33...

272
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,900
- Thirty...
- Could you stop the counting?

273
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,600
- What?
- Can I make it up to you?

274
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,100
I'll give you $50 for the jug.

275
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,100
Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.

276
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Well, then I'm not gonna go
to the game either.

277
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,800
Okay, I'll give him both tickets.

278
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,000
Go. Go!

279
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,900
l... No, I don't want to go.

280
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,200
- He was really crying?
- I had to give him a tissue.

281
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,300
In fact, let me call his machine now,
and I'll make up some excuse...

282
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,800
...why I can't go to the game either.

283
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,900
Wait. Wait a minute. As long
as you're gonna lie to the guy...

284
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,800
...why don't you tell him that you lost
both of the tickets. Then we can go.

285
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,100
George, the man wept.

286
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,900
Hey, guys.

287
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,700
Man, I'm telling you, this pizza idea
is really gonna happen.

288
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,200
This is the thing where you go and
you have to make your own pizza?

289
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,500
We give you the dough.

290
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,900
You smash it. You pound it.
You fling it up in the air.

291
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,800
And then you get to put your sauce
and sprinkle your cheese.

292
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,400
And then,
you slide it into the oven.

293
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,200
You have to know how to do that.

294
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,800
You can't have people shoving
their arms into a 600-degree oven!

295
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,600
- It's all supervised.
- Oh, well...

296
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,200
All of it!

297
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,400
- You want to invest?
- My money's tied up in change.

298
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,100
You know, look. I'm telling you.

299
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,000
People, they really want to make
their own pizza pie.

300
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,300
I have to say something,
with all due respect.

301
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,400
I just never...
I can't imagine anyone...

302
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,200
...in any walk of life,
under any circumstance...

303
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,000
...wanting to make
their own pizza pie.

304
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,100
- But that's me.
- Well, okay.

305
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
- That's you.
- I'm just saying.

306
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,400
I just wanted to check with you guys.
This business is going to be big.

307
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,400
I just want to... Okay.

308
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,200
One day, you'll beg me
to make your own pie.

309
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,800
Hi, Joel. This is Jerry.
I hope you get this before you...

310
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,200
Oh, hi, Joel. Oh, you just came in.

311
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:03,800
Listen, I can't make it
to the game tonight.

312
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,100
I have to tutor my nephew.

313
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,800
Yeah, he's got an exam tomorrow.

314
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,900
Geometry.

315
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,500
You know, trapezoid, rhombus.

316
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,300
Anyway, listen, you take the tickets.
They're at the will-call window.

317
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:22,100
And I'm really sorry. Have a good time.
We'll talk next week, okay? Yeah.

318
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,600
Yeah. I don't... Fine.

319
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,500
Fine, bye.

320
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,800
"Trapezoid"?

321
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,800
I know. I'm really running out
of excuses with this guy.

322
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,400
I need some kind of excuse Rolodex.

323
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,000
Come on. Let's go do something.
I don't want to just sit around here.

324
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,800
- Wanna get something to eat?
- Where?

325
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't care. I'm not hungry.

326
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,300
We could go to one of those
cappuccino places.

327
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,200
They let you just sit there.

328
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
What are we gonna do there, talk?

329
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,100
We can talk.

330
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,000
I'll go if I don't have to talk.

331
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,400
Then we'll just sit there.

332
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,600
Okay, I'm gonna check
my machine first.

333
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,400
"Picking someone up
at airport, jury duty...

334
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,400
...waiting for cable company."
- Okay, just hand that over, please.

335
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,800
- What is this?
- It's a list of excuses.

336
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,900
It's for that guy Horneck, who's
at the game tonight with my tickets.

337
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,600
I have that list now, so in case
he calls, I just consult it...

338
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,400
...and I don't have to see him.

339
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,800
- God.
- I need it.

340
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,400
- What are you doing?
- I got some for you.

341
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,800
- Oh, I don't need any more.
- No, no, no.

342
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,900
These are good. Listen, listen.

343
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,800
"You ran out of underwear,
you can't leave the house."

344
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,900
Very funny.

345
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,100
How about you've been diagnosed...

346
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,900
...as a multiple personality?
You're not even you.

347
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,900
You're Dan.

348
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,200
I'm Dan.

349
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,600
- Can I have my list back, please?
- Here. Here.

350
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,900
Jerry Seinfeld, I cannot
believe you are doing this.

351
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,000
This is absolutely infantile.

352
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,100
- What can I do?
- Deal with it. Be a man.

353
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,700
Oh, no.

354
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,100
That's impossible. I'd rather
lie to him the rest of my life...

355
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,000
...than go through that again.

356
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,400
He was crying.

357
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,100
Tears, accompanied by mucus.

358
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,900
You made a man cry?

359
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,100
I never made a man cry.

360
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,000
I even kicked a guy in the groin once,
and he didn't cry.

361
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,000
I got the cab.

362
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,200
A couple of tough monkeys.

363
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,300
Hi, Elaine.

364
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,000
Hey, you missed
a great game tonight.

365
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,400
- Game?
- Knick game.

366
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Horneck took me. We're sitting
two rows behind the bench.

367
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,900
We were getting hit by sweat!

368
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,200
Wait. How does Horneck know you?

369
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,800
Last week, when I, you know,
gave you the phone.

370
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
He's really into my pizza place idea.

371
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,100
- This is too much.
- Wait. What pizza place idea?

372
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh, no.

373
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,000
You get to make your own pie.

374
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:14,200
That sounds like a great idea.
It would be fun.

375
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,000
- Kramer!
- Yeah!

376
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,600
Perfect.

377
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,100
Hey!

378
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,600
Okay, who wants meat loaf?

379
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,700
- No, thanks.
- No, no.

380
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
It's gonna be hot in a minute.

381
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,900
So I thought you were
tutoring your nephew.

382
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,200
- We finished early.
- I'll bet.

383
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,400
So are you going to introduce me
to your nephew?

384
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,300
Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.

385
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,900
Whoa, Nelson.

386
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,200
This is Elaine.

387
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,600
- I thought you guys split up.
- We're still friends.

388
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,900
So...

389
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,300
Thanks again for those tickets,
But next week, I'm gonna take you.

390
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,800
How about next Tuesday night?
Why don't you come along.

391
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,300
Oh, no, no. Tuesday's no good
because we've got choir practice.

392
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,200
Right.

393
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,100
- Forgot about choir.
- Yeah.

394
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,400
We're... We're doing that evening...

395
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,800
...of Eastern European
national anthems.

396
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,200
Right. You know...

397
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,800
...the wall being down and everything.

398
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,200
Well, what about Thursday night?
I mean, they're playing the Sonics.

399
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,800
Thursday is not good because
we've gotta get to the hospital...

400
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,200
...to see if we qualify
as those organ donors.

401
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,100
I should really try
something like that.

402
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:33,000
You really should.

403
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,300
Well, let's just take a look here.

404
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,000
Forty-one home games.

405
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,300
Let's see, Saturday night
we got the Mavericks.

406
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,800
If you don't like the Mavericks,
next Tuesday, Lakers.

407
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,500
I mean, you gotta like Magic, right?

408
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,200
Now, let's see. On the road,
on the road, on the road...

409
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,200
Back, back on the 14th.

410
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,400
They play the Bulls.
You can't miss Air Jordan...

411
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,400
I've come to the conclusion that there
are certain friends in your life...

412
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,500
...that they're just always your friends,
and you have to accept it.

413
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,400
You see them. You don't want
to see them. You don't call them.

414
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,100
They call you.

415
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,400
You don't call back,
they call again.

416
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,700
The way to get through talking
with people...

417
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,400
...you have nothing in common with...

418
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,200
...is to pretend you're hosting
your own little talk show.

419
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,000
This is what I do. Pretend there's
a little desk around you.

420
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,600
There's a little chair over there,
and you interview them.

421
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,600
The only problem is,
there's no way to say:

422
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,600
"Hey, it's been great having
you on the show.

423
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,000
We're out of time."

424
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
