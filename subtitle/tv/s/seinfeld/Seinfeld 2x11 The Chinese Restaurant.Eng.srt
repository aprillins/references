1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,868
I'm on the street the other day,
make a pay phone call...

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,270
...go overtime on the call...

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,839
...hang up the phone, walk away.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,594
You've had this happen?
What...?

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,355
Phone rings.
It's the phone company.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,431
They want more money.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,634
Don't you love this? And you've
got them right where you want them...

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,234
...for the first time in your life.
You're on the street.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,392
There's nothing they can do.
I like to let it ring a few times...

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,030
...you know, let her sweat
a little over there...

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,953
...and then just pick it up.
"Yeah, hello, operator?

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,951
Oh, I've got the money.

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,870
I've got the money right here.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,678
You hear that?

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,157
That's a quarter.

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,113
Yeah, you want that, don't you?"

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,036
No, they just have to get more cops
on the force, it's as simple as that.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,838
Cops, I don't even care about cops.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,592
I wanna see garbage men.

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,591
It's much more important.
All I wanna see...

21
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,513
...are garbage trucks, garbage cans
and garbage men.

22
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,433
You're never gonna stop crime.
We should at least be clean.

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,592
I tell you what they should do.
They should combine the two jobs.

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,991
Make it one job. Coplgarbage man.

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,555
I always see cops walking around
with nothing to do. Grab a broom.

26
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,952
Start sweeping.
You sweep, sweep, sweep.

27
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,918
Catch a criminal,
get right back to sweeping.

28
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,595
- You should run for mayor.
- Nobody listens.

29
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,238
Where is someone? I'm starving.

30
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,231
Think this is him right here.

31
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,311
- Is there a table ready?
- How many?

32
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,155
- How many?
- Is Tatiana coming?

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,069
Well, I don't know. I have to call her,
tell her where we are.

34
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,595
I'm very lucky she's even
considering seeing me at all.

35
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,035
Really? I thought things
were going okay.

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,039
They were. It's kind of complicated.

37
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,633
Well, what is it?

38
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,756
- How many?
- All right, four. Seinfeld.

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,189
Four.

40
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,237
That'll be five, 1 0 minutes.

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,990
- What do you wanna do?
- Let's go someplace else.

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,435
- I am too hungry.
- We might as well just stay here.

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,397
We haven't got much time
before the movie.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,117
I'm gonna call Tatiana.
There's the phone.

45
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,793
Tatiana.

46
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,394
Excuse me. Are you gonna
be very long?

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,154
Lasbrook, four.

48
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,959
- So did I do a terrible thing?
- You mean lying to your uncle?

49
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,111
I couldn't have dinner with him.

50
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,838
Plan 9 from Outer Space.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,956
One night only. The big screen.

52
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,111
My hands are tied.

53
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,116
You know, it's a public phone.
You're not supposed to just chitchat.

54
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,632
Jerry, get menus so when we sit down
we'll be able to order right away.

55
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,950
Can't look at a menu now,
I gotta be at the table.

56
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,599
He knows I'm waiting.

57
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,354
He sees me.
He just doesn't wanna look.

58
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,637
Everything's gotta be just so
all the time with you, doesn't it?

59
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,995
I offered you those cookies
in my house.

60
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,280
Health cookies. I hate those
little dust-board fructose things.

61
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,837
I just can't believe
the way people are.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,629
What is it with humanity?
What kind of a world do we live in?

63
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,674
What?

64
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,110
There's a woman over there
looks really familiar.

65
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,952
Dark hair, striped shirt.

66
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,348
I've never seen her before.

67
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,351
I know this woman.

68
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,193
This is gonna drive me crazy.

69
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,000
- Excuse me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

70
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,953
Did you see that? Those people...

71
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,792
Look, they're getting a table.

72
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,359
Maybe they were here from before.

73
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,397
No, no, they weren't here before.

74
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,514
Are you gonna be much longer?

75
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,830
I have to make a very important call.

76
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,429
Find out what's going on.

77
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,478
Excuse me.

78
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,995
Didn't those people just come in?

79
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,549
- I believe we were ahead of them.
- Yeah.

80
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,711
- What's your name?
- Seinfeld.

81
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,470
No, no. They were here before.

82
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,355
Kackige, two.

83
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,078
You ever notice how happy people are
when they finally get a table?

84
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,755
They feel so special because
they've been chosen.

85
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,993
It's enough to make you sick.

86
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,119
Boy, you are really hungry.

87
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,239
Hey.

88
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,396
If anything happens here,
can I count on you?

89
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,514
What?

90
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,639
If we decide to go at it.

91
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,319
Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble.

92
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,233
I have to get in touch with Tatiana.

93
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,436
Look at his little outfit.

94
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,876
It's all so coordinated.
The little socks match the little shirt.

95
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,871
I really hate this guy.

96
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,236
Oh, I'm gonna faint.

97
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,118
George...

98
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,710
...who is that woman
In the stripes?

99
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,469
I don't know her.

100
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,551
She looks so familiar.

101
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,439
It's not fair that people are seated
first come, first served.

102
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,751
It should be based on
who's hungriest.

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,309
I feel like walking over there
and taking some food...

104
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,913
...off of somebody's plate.

105
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,638
I'll tell you what.

106
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,030
There's 50 bucks in it for you
if you do it.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,353
What do you mean?

108
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,431
You walk over to that table...

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,558
...you pick up an egg roll,
you don't say anything...

110
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,071
...you eat it...

111
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,673
...say, "Thank you very much"...

112
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,034
...wipe your mouth, walk away...

113
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,792
...I give you 50 bucks.

114
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,360
- What are they gonna do?
- They won't do anything. In fact...

115
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,637
...you'll be giving them a story
to tell for the rest of their lives.

116
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,038
Fifty bucks?
You'll give me 50 bucks?

117
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,349
Fifty bucks.

118
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,238
That table over there.

119
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,674
The three couples.

120
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,310
Okay, I don't wanna go over there
and do it...

121
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,711
...and then come back here and find
out there was some little loophole...

122
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,519
...like I didn't put mustard on it
or something.

123
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,910
No tricks.

124
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,319
- Should I do it, George?
- For 50 bucks?

125
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,392
I'd put my face in their soup
and blow.

126
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,395
All right. All right.

127
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,754
Here, hold this.

128
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,275
I'm doing it.

129
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,758
I know this sounds crazy,
but the two men standing behind me...

130
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,117
...will give me 50 bucks if I stand here
and eat one of your egg rolls.

131
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,036
I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.

132
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,191
- What?
- What is she talking about?

133
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,271
What did she say?
What did she say?

134
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,398
- Will someone tell me what she said?
- Twenty-five dollars?

135
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,071
- What happened?
- Did you see that?

136
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,276
- What were you telling them?
- I offered them 25.

137
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,590
- They had no idea why.
- Oh, God.

138
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,230
- George, the phone's free.
- Hallelujah.

139
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,113
Excuse me. I was waiting here.

140
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,439
- Where? I didn't see you.
- I've been here for 1 0 minutes.

141
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,433
- I won't be long.
- That's not the point.

142
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,035
The point is I was here first.

143
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,117
Well, if you were here first...

144
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,032
...you'd be holding the phone.

145
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,995
You know, we're living in a society!

146
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,835
We're supposed to act
in a civilized way!

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,355
Does she care? No.

148
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,557
Does anyone ever display
the slightest sensitivity...

149
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,551
...over the problems
of a fellow individual?

150
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,234
No. No! A resounding no.

151
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,789
- Hey, sorry I took so long.
- Oh, that's okay.

152
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,678
Really, don't worry about it.

153
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,991
How do people fast?

154
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,879
Did Gandhi get this crazy?

155
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm gonna go walk around
and see what dishes look good.

156
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,800
I told my uncle I had a stomachache.
Think he bought that?

157
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,474
Yeah, he probably bought it.

158
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,631
So, what happened with Tatiana?

159
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,958
- I shouldn't even tell you.
- Come on.

160
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,554
After dinner last week,
she invites me to her apartment.

161
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,199
I'm with you.

162
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,832
Well, it's this little place
with this little bathroom.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,912
And it's, like, right there, you know?
It's not even...

164
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,548
...down a little hall or off in an alcove,
you understand?

165
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,153
There's no...

166
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,594
...buffer zone.

167
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,439
So...

168
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,670
...we start to fool around...

169
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,515
...and it's the first time,
and it's early in the going...

170
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,590
...and I begin to perceive
this impending...

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,719
...intestinal requirement...

172
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,272
...whose needs are going to surpass,
by great lengths...

173
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,158
...anything in the sexual realm.

174
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,670
So I know I'm gonna have to stop.

175
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,472
And as this is happening, I'm thinking
even if I can somehow manage...

176
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,073
...to momentarily...

177
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,512
...extricate myself
from the proceedings...

178
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,992
...and relieve this
unstoppable force...

179
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,594
...I know that that bathroom
is not gonna provide me...

180
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,274
...with the privacy that I know
I'm going to need.

181
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,155
This could only happen to you.

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,274
So...

183
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,318
...I finally stop and say:

184
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,997
"Tatiana, I hope you don't take this
the wrong way...

185
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,991
...but I think it would be best
if I left."

186
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,995
You said this to her after?

187
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,199
No.

188
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,994
During.

189
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,434
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

190
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,033
Wow. So?

191
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,754
So I'm dressing,
and she's staring up at me...

192
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,959
...struggling to compute this
unprecedented turn of events.

193
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,078
I don't know what to say
to reassure her.

194
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,515
And worst of all, I don't have
the time to say it.

195
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,235
The only excuse she might
possibly have accepted...

196
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,551
...is if I told her I am,
in reality, Batman.

197
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,559
And I'm very sorry,
I just saw the Bat Signal.

198
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,876
It took me three days of phone calls
to get her to agree to see me again.

199
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,959
Now she's waiting for me to call,
and she's still on the phone.

200
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,151
I hate this place.

201
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,915
I don't know why we came here.
I am never coming back here again.

202
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,308
Who is that woman?

203
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,508
Remember when you first went
out to eat with your parents?

204
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,071
Remember?
It was such a treat to go.

205
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,949
And they serve you this different food
that you never saw before.

206
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,799
And they put it in front of you...

207
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,714
...and it was such a delicious
and exciting adventure.

208
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,717
And now I just feel
like a big sweaty hog...

209
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,348
...waiting for them
to fill up the trough.

210
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,235
Oh, she's off.

211
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,112
- Jerry, talk to that guy again.
- What am I gonna say?

212
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,192
Tell him we wanna catch a movie
and that we're late.

213
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,674
Hey. What stinks in here?

214
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,197
Mr. Cohen, haven't seen you
for a couple of weeks.

215
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,715
Well, I've been looking
for a better place.

216
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,997
Better place! Want a...?
Want a table?

217
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,118
No, just bring me a plate,
and I'll eat here.

218
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,795
Bring him a plate.
He'll eat here.

219
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,757
Come on, I'll give you a table.

220
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,909
Excuse me.

221
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,994
We've been waiting here.

222
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,470
Now, I know we were ahead
of that guy. He just came in.

223
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,588
Oh, no.
Mr. Cohen always here.

224
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,792
He's always here? What does
that mean? What does that mean?

225
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,075
Mr. Cohen, very nice man.

226
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,196
He live on Park Avenue.

227
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,716
Where am I?

228
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,751
Is this a dream?

229
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,352
What in God's name
is going on here?

230
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,872
She's not there. She left.

231
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,350
She must have waited and left,
because those people wouldn't get off.

232
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,273
- Did you leave a message?
- Yeah, I told her to call me here...

233
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,032
...and to tell anyone that answers...

234
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,237
...to ask for a balding,
stocky man with glasses.

235
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,755
I better tell them
I'm expecting a call.

236
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,993
- Jerry, here comes that woman.
- Where do I know her?

237
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,837
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hey.

238
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,193
How are you doing?

239
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,239
- How is everything?
- Good, good.

240
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,634
What's going on?

241
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,397
I'm working hard. And you?

242
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,952
Oh, you know, working around.

243
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,997
Same stuff.

244
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,708
Doing...

245
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,598
...whatever.

246
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,715
- You haven't been around in a while.
- I know. I know. Well...

247
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,677
...you know.

248
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,708
You should come by.

249
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,873
Definitely. I plan to.

250
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,190
I'm not just saying that.

251
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,476
- Hi. I'm Elaine.
- Oh, Lorraine Catalano.

252
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,353
I'm sorry. Lorraine, this is Elaine.

253
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,080
Well, it was nice seeing you, Jerry.
And nice meeting you.

254
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,550
Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine.

255
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,634
Oh, my God, Lorraine.

256
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,916
That's Lorraine from
my uncle's office.

257
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,116
I am in big, big trouble.

258
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,750
- The one you broke the plans with?
- Yeah, she works in his office.

259
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,558
Now she's gonna see him
tomorrow...

260
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,915
...and tell him she saw me
here tonight.

261
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,674
He's gonna tell his wife.
His wife's gonna call my mother.

262
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,640
Oh, this is bad. You don't know.

263
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,469
The chain reaction of calls
this is gonna set off.

264
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,236
New York, Long Island, Florida.
It's like the Bermuda Triangle.

265
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,670
Unfortunately,
nobody ever disappears.

266
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,079
My uncle to my aunt,
my aunt to my mother...

267
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,673
...my mother to my uncle.

268
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,431
My uncle to my cousin, my cousin
to my sister, my sister to me.

269
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,637
You should've just had dinner with him
tonight and gotten it over with.

270
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,234
- It's just a movie.
- Just a movie?

271
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,753
You don't understand.

272
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,673
This isn't Plans 1-8
from Outer Space.

273
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,114
This is Plan 9.

274
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,998
This is the one that worked.

275
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,230
The worst movie ever made.

276
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,471
I'm really looking forward to it.

277
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,710
I got news for you.
If we're making this movie...

278
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,279
...we gotta get a table
immediately.

279
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,034
Let's stop fooling around.
Let's just slip him some money.

280
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,669
In a Chinese restaurant?
Do they take money?

281
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,676
" Do they take money?"
Everyone takes money.

282
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,872
I went out with a guy who did it all
the time. You slip them 20 bucks.

283
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,672
Twenty bucks?

284
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,753
Isn't that excessive?

285
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,470
Well, what do you wanna
give him, change?

286
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,834
It's more than the meal.

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,719
Oh, come on, we'll divide it up
three ways.

288
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,555
All right. Seven, seven, six.

289
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,510
I'm not gonna eat that much.

290
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,070
I'm counting your shrimps.

291
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,517
Okay, who's gonna do it?

292
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,508
Oh, no, I can't do it.

293
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,716
I'm not good at these things.
I get flustered.

294
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,030
Once I tried to bribe an usher
at the Roller Derby.

295
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,872
I almost got arrested.

296
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,919
I guess it's you, Jer.

297
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,959
- Me? What about you?
- Oh, I can't do that. It's a guy thing.

298
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,239
The women's movement just can't
seem to make any progress...

299
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,595
...in the world of bribery, can they?

300
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,837
Give me the money.

301
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,038
How's it going?

302
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,191
Very busy.

303
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:27,275
Boy, we are really anxious
to sit down.

304
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,795
Very good specials tonight.

305
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,479
If there's anything you can do
to get us a table...

306
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,551
...we'd really appreciate it.

307
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,392
Oh, what is your name?

308
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,833
No, no, I wanna eat now.

309
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,509
Yes, whole sea bass dinner tonight,
very fresh.

310
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,875
Here. Take this. I'm starving.

311
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,156
Take it. Take it.

312
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,589
Dennison, four!

313
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,391
Your table is ready.

314
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,437
No, no. I want that table.

315
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,830
I want that table!

316
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,999
Come on, did you see that?
What was that?

317
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,230
He took the money.
He didn't give us a table.

318
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,552
- You lost the 20.
- Well, how could he do that?

319
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,915
- You didn't make it clear.
- Make it clear?

320
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,799
What a sorry exhibition that was.

321
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,315
All right, let me get the money back.

322
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,158
Excuse me.

323
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,754
I realize this is extremely
embarrassing.

324
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,356
My friend here apparently
made a mistake.

325
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,238
Your name?

326
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,439
- Seinfeld.
- Yes, Seinfeld, four.

327
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,398
No, no. Do you see the girl
over there with the long hair?

328
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,513
Oh, yes, yes.

329
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,229
Very beautiful girl. Very beautiful.
Your girlfriend?

330
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,960
Well, actually, we did date
for a while, but...

331
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,350
That's really not relevant here.

332
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,397
Relationships are difficult.

333
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,790
It is very hard to stay together...

334
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,632
All right, listen. All right.

335
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,392
How much longer is it gonna be?

336
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,718
Be about five, 1 0 minutes.

337
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,833
So?

338
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,754
There seems to be
a bit of a discrepancy.

339
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,956
- So when are we gonna eat?
- Five, 1 0 minutes.

340
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,390
We should've left earlier. I told you.

341
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,030
I don't see any way we can eat
and make this movie.

342
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,838
Oh, well, I have to eat.

343
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,956
Let's order it to go,
We'll eat it in the cab.

344
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,350
Eat it in the cab?
Chinese food in a cab?

345
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,273
- We'll eat it in the movie.
- Where do you think you're going?

346
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,317
You think they have
big picnic tables there?

347
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,638
- Well, what do you suggest?
- I say we leave now...

348
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,030
...we go to Sky Burger,
and we scarf them down.

349
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,317
I'm not going to Sky Burger.
Besides, it's in the opposite direction.

350
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,239
- Let's just eat popcorn or something.
- Cartwright?

351
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,273
I can't have popcorn for dinner.

352
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,875
- Cartwright!
- I have to eat.

353
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,913
Well, they have hot dogs there.

354
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,232
Oh, movie hot dogs?
I'd rather lick the food off the floor.

355
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,312
I can't go anyway. I have to wait here
for Tatiana's call.

356
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,029
Let me just check. Excuse me,
I'm expecting a call. Costanza?

357
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,557
Yes. I just got a call.

358
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,793
I yell, " Cartwright? Cartwright!"
Just like that.

359
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,996
Nobody came up. I hang up.

360
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,437
Well, was it for Costanza or...?

361
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,353
Yes, yes, that's it.
Nobody answered.

362
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,313
Was it a woman?

363
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,833
Yes, yes.

364
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,195
I tell her you not here.

365
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,510
She said curse word. I hang up.

366
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,598
She called.

367
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,590
He yelled, " Cartwright."

368
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,154
I missed her.

369
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,754
Who's Cartwright?

370
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,872
I'm Cartwright.

371
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,593
- You're not Cartwright.
- Of course I'm not Cartwright!

372
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,315
Why don't you two go to the movies
by yourselves. I'm not in the mood.

373
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,636
Well, me either.
I'm going to Sky Burger.

374
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,715
- So you're not going?
- You don't need us.

375
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,434
Well, I can't go to a bad movie
by myself.

376
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,672
What, am I gonna make
sarcastic remarks to strangers?

377
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,556
I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.

378
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,076
- Should we tell him we're leaving?
- What for? Let's just get out of here.

379
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,992
Seinfeld, four!

380
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,749
Hunger will make people
do amazing things.

381
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,036
I mean, the proof of that
is cannibalism.

382
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,038
Cannibalism. What...?

383
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,839
What do they say? I mean,
they're eating, you know.

384
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,150
"This is good. Who is this?

385
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,595
I like this person."

386
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,559
You know, I mean...

387
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,188
I would think the hardest thing
about being a cannibal...

388
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,033
...is trying to get some really
deep sleep.

389
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,033
You know what I mean?
I would think you'd be like:

390
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,873
"What was that? Who's there?

391
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,792
Who's there? Is somebody there?

392
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,439
What do you want?
What do you want?

393
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,431
You look hungry. Are you hungry?

394
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,919
Get out of here."

395
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,071
