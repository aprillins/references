1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,309
You know, I gotta say that I'm enjoying
adulthood for a lot of reasons.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,879
I'll tell you reason number one:

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,518
As an adult, if I want a cookie,
I have a cookie, okay?

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,638
I have three cookies
or four cookies...

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,997
...or 1 1 cookies if I want.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,188
Many times, I will intentionally ruin
my entire appetite.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,554
Just ruin it.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,156
And then I call my mother up
right after to tell her that I did it.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,676
" Hello, Mom? Yeah, I just ruined
my entire appetite.

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,876
Cookies."

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,029
So what if you ruin it?

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,078
As an adult, we understand
even if you ruin an appetite...

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,118
...there's another appetite coming
right behind it.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,919
There's no danger
in running out of appetites.

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,789
I've got millions of them.
I ruin them whenever I want.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,474
Look, Zigmond. Look at the sky!

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,756
The planet's on fire!

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,990
It is just as you prophesised!

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,596
The planets of our solar system
incinerating...

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,756
...lik e flaming globes, Zigmond,
lik e flaming globes!

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,797
Zigmond...

22
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,316
- Coffee.
- Thank you.

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,188
What do you got, a cucumber?

24
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,870
Yeah. So what?

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,636
You're bringing in
an outside cucumber?

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,758
They refuse to put cucumber
in the salad. I need cucumber.

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,310
What have I done? What...?
I can't read this.

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,870
" Fullman hurtel vom"?

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,993
I got up last night, I wrote this down.
I thought I had this great bit.

30
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,276
Wait a second.

31
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,750
" Fax me some halibut."

32
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,471
Is that funny? Is that a joke?

33
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,198
No. Let me see that.

34
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,915
" Don't mess with Johnny."

35
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,958
Johnny? Johnny who?

36
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,998
Johnny Carson? Did I insult Johnny
on The Tonight Show?

37
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,628
Did you mess with Johnny, Jerry?

38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,949
Let me see that.

39
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,473
- Hey, where's Kramer?
- I don't know.

40
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,835
That's like asking,
"Where's Waldo?"

41
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,072
I think I'm having a heart attack.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,479
I don't think that's it.

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,551
- I'm not kidding.
- What does that mean?

44
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,675
I think what he's trying to say...

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,796
...is that he's having a heart attack.

46
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,552
Oh, he's having a heart attack.

47
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,878
- Tightness.
- Come on.

48
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,031
- Shortness of breath.
- This is ridiculous.

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,430
- Radiating waves of pain.
- I know what this is!

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,071
You saw that show on PBS last night,
Coronary Country.

51
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,470
I saw it in the TV Guide,
I called him...

52
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,835
...told him make sure
and not watch it.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,752
There was nothing else on.

54
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,514
- Here, have some water.
- Oh, the left arm, left arm.

55
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,111
He saw that show
on anorexia last year...

56
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,316
...ate like an animal for two weeks.

57
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,914
Why can't I have a heart attack?!
I'm allowed.

58
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,832
You want me to take you
to the hospital?

59
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,196
Manhattan Memorial. Less of a line.

60
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,952
I'll call an ambulance.

61
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,359
Is everything all right?

62
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,837
We'll just take a check.

63
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,914
You made a mistake on the...

64
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,991
George.

65
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,312
Are you okay?

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,470
I'm George. George Costanza.

67
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,591
I never been in the hospital
a day in my life...

68
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,235
...except when I had my tonsils out.

69
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,510
You know, they never gave me
any ice cream.

70
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,988
- I always felt that if they...
- Shut up!

71
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,715
- Well, what do you think?
- "Salami salami bologna."

72
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,438
Definitely.

73
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,830
"Salami salami bologna"?

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,152
Oh, your friend's fine. He didn't have a
heart attack. I'll be in in a few minutes.

75
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,753
What a surprise.

76
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,393
Hey.

77
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,993
How you doing, buddy?

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,353
You need anything?

79
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,554
You want me to go out,
get you a Superman comic?

80
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,116
No. No, thanks.

81
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,200
You know, I was wondering...

82
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,430
...you know that Blackhawks jacket
you have?

83
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,637
Oh, sure, my Blackhawks jacket.
I love my Blackhawks jacket.

84
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,590
Well, you know, I was thinking,
if things don't exactly...

85
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,757
...work out...

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,799
Well, it wouldn't fit you.
The sleeves are too short.

87
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,712
No, I tried it on. It fits good.

88
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,916
I didn't think about
what I was gonna do...

89
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,117
...with all the things...
- Well, you know...

90
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,158
Well...

91
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,231
- Well, okay.
- Oh, and...

92
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,960
...do you think it'd be all right
if I called Susan Davis?

93
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,190
Susan Davis?! Hey, wait a second!

94
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,079
Well, it's not like we'll be
bumping into you.

95
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,270
I don't know. You and Susan Davis?

96
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,192
You know...

97
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,112
...if your future was more certain...

98
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,274
Okay.

99
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,677
Go ahead. Call her.

100
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,956
Get married. Have babies.
Have a great life.

101
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,352
What do I care? I'm finished.

102
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,511
It's all over for me.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,797
In fact...

104
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,030
...let's end it right now.

105
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,553
Jerry...

106
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,199
...kill me.

107
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,276
Kill me now. I'm begging you.

108
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,113
Let's just get it over with. Be a pal.

109
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,158
Just take the pillow
and put it over my face.

110
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,429
Well...

111
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,594
- What, kind of like this?
- What...? What are you...?

112
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,555
Jerry! Hey!

113
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,869
Jerry!

114
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,632
Elaine. What are you doing here?

115
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,112
Jerk-off.

116
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,149
There's nothing wrong with him.
I saw the doctor. He's fine.

117
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,796
Hi, George.

118
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,076
How you feeling?

119
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,393
Is anybody getting your apartment?

120
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,069
I'll tell you, if I ever get out of here...

121
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,390
...l'm gonna change my life.

122
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,358
I'm gonna do a whole Zen thing.

123
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,238
Take up yoga.

124
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,988
Meditate. I'll eat right.

125
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,830
Calm down, you know?

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,070
Lose my anger.

127
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,555
Hey, is anybody listening?!

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,274
Hello.

129
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,553
Mr. Costanza.

130
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,914
Excuse me.

131
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,231
Yeah, you know, doc, I gotta tell you,
I feel a lot better.

132
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,593
Well, we looked at your EKGs, ran
some tests, did a complete workup.

133
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,193
Oh, God. Mommy.

134
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,476
Well, you simply haven't had
a heart attack.

135
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,833
I haven't?

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,319
I'm okay?

137
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,516
I'm okay? Oh, thank you!

138
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,318
Thank you!

139
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,913
I don't know how to thank you!

140
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,277
Hey, that was really fun, George.
Can we go home now?

141
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,477
No, we'd like to keep him overnight
for observation, just to be safe.

142
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,834
Oh, sure, sure, anything.

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,036
Can you believe it?
Nothing's wrong with me.

144
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,517
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

145
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,234
What?

146
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,628
Oh, my God. What?

147
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,028
Is it meningitis?

148
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,349
Scoliosis?

149
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,272
Lupus? Is it lupus?!

150
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,029
Have you ever had your tonsils
taken out?

151
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,998
My tonsils?

152
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,479
Yeah, when I was a kid.

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,877
Well, they've grown back.

154
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,632
And your adenoids are swollen too.

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,558
- Really?
- Yeah.

156
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,713
- Oh, whose tonsils grow back?
- It happens.

157
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,314
Yeah, if you've been exposed
to gamma rays.

158
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,633
I still have my tonsils.

159
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,279
Everyone in my family has theirs.

160
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,591
In fact, we were forbidden
to socialize with anybody...

161
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,512
...who didn't have their tonsils.

162
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,070
That's interesting, because no one
in my family has their tonsils.

163
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:38,118
And we were forbidden to socialize
with tonsil people.

164
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,590
Well, it's like the Capulets
and the Montagues.

165
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,993
Excuse me.

166
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,069
Anyway, I strongly recommend
they come out.

167
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,478
What? You mean, with a knife?

168
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,429
Yes, with a knife.
You know, snip, snip.

169
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,559
Anyway, you'd be completely under.
You wouldn't feel a thing.

170
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,870
And when you wake up,
you can have some ice cream.

171
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,429
Yeah, that's what they told me
the last time.

172
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,353
Think about it.

173
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,948
Excuse me.

174
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,838
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

175
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,513
I just have to ask that doctor
one more...

176
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,079
...question.

177
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,119
Women go after doctors
like men go after models.

178
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,238
They want someone with knowledge
of the body. We just want the body.

179
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,715
- Hey.
- Hey.

180
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,995
Boy...

181
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,549
...they got a great cafeteria
downstairs.

182
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,280
Hot food, sandwiches, a salad bar.

183
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,829
It's like Sizzler opened up a hospital.

184
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,474
Boy...

185
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,358
So how did you have a heart attack?

186
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,876
You're a young man.

187
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,792
What were you doing?

188
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,439
They gonna do a zipper job?

189
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,273
- Oh, they love to do zipper jobs.
- Kramer.

190
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,477
You know, the really bad thing
about the heart is the sex thing.

191
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,471
See, you gotta be careful
about sex now.

192
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,153
You get that heart pumping...

193
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,712
Suddenly, boom!
Next thing you know...

194
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,395
...you got a hose coming out of your
chest attached to a piece of luggage.

195
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,675
Kramer, George didn't have
a heart attack.

196
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,717
No? That's good.

197
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,030
I have to have my tonsils taken out.

198
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,471
Oh, man. No.

199
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,074
George, we gotta get you out of here.
Get out right now.

200
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,639
They'll kill you in here.

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,353
It's routine surgery.

202
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,034
Oh, yeah?
My friend Bob Sacamano...

203
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,953
...he came in here
for a hernia operation.

204
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,872
Oh, yeah, " routine surgery."

205
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,076
Now he's sitting in a chair
by a window going:

206
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,832
" My name is Bob!"

207
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,560
George, whatever you do,
don't let them cut you.

208
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,438
Don't let them cut you.

209
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,033
Well, what should I do, Kramer?

210
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,919
- For one thing, don't listen to him.
- I'll tell you what you do.

211
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,635
I'll tell you what you do.
You go to Tor Ackman.

212
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,552
Tor. He'll fix you right up.

213
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,790
He's an herbalist, a healer, George.

214
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,235
He's not just gonna fix the tonsils
and the adenoids.

215
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,073
He is gonna change
the whole way you function.

216
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,958
Body and mind.

217
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,836
Ackman? I thought he was doing time.

218
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,275
No, no, he's out. He got out.

219
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,909
See, the medical establishment...

220
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,238
See, they tried to frame him.
It's all politics, but he's a rebel.

221
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,118
A rebel?

222
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,350
No, Johnny Yuma was a rebel.

223
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,636
Ackman is a nut.

224
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,315
You wanna take care of your tonsils,
do it in a hospital with a doctor.

225
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,754
He's holistic.

226
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,990
George, he's holistic.

227
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,511
- Holistic?
- Yeah.

228
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,797
That sounds right.

229
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,155
George, you need a medical doctor.

230
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,117
Let me ask you something.

231
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,113
How much do you think it would cost
to have tonsils and adenoids...

232
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,952
...removed in a hospital?

233
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,078
Well, an overnight stay in a hospital,
minor surgery, I don't know...

234
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,673
...four grand?

235
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,639
- How much does the healer charge?
- First visit? 38 bucks.

236
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,312
Oh, yeah. Holistic.

237
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,436
That's what I need.
That's the answer.

238
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,792
You like the way I talked you
into coming?

239
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,393
Don't flatter yourself,
my friend.

240
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,869
I'm here strictly for material.
And I have a feeling...

241
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,476
...this is a potential gold mine.
I still think you're nuts, though.

242
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,996
All I know is, I've been going to doctors
all my life. What's it gotten me?

243
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,390
I'm 33, I haven't outgrown
the problems of puberty...

244
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,471
...l'm already facing
the problems of old age.

245
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,393
I completely skipped
healthy adulthood.

246
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,916
I went from having orgasms
immediately to taking forever.

247
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,470
You can do your taxes in the time
it takes me to have an orgasm.

248
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,596
I never had a normal...

249
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,034
...medium orgasm.

250
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,515
I never had a really good pickle.

251
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,753
Besides, what's it gonna cost me,
38 bucks?

252
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,591
Would you not put your foot
on that, please?

253
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,159
Sorry.

254
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,315
- What month were you born?
- April.

255
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,994
You should have been born
in August.

256
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,678
Your parents would have been
well-advised to wait.

257
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,679
Really?

258
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,516
Do you use hot water in the shower?

259
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,358
- Yes.
- Stop using it.

260
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,836
- Okay.
- I'm off hot water.

261
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,118
Kramer tells me that you are interested
in an alternative to surgery.

262
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,759
Yes. Yes, I am.

263
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,712
I think we can help you.

264
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,914
See, unfortunately,
the medical establishment...

265
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,355
...is a business
like any other business.

266
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,715
And business needs customers.

267
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,996
They want to sell you
their most expensive item...

268
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,037
...which is unnecessary surgery.

269
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,716
Can I use hot water on my face?

270
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,632
No. You know...

271
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,314
...I am not a businessman.

272
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,870
I am a holistic healer.
It's a calling. It's a gift.

273
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,713
You see, it's in the best interest
of the medical profession...

274
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,714
...that you remain sick.
See, that insures good business.

275
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,110
You're not a patient,
you're a customer.

276
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,317
And you're not a doctor,
but you play one in real life.

277
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,148
What about shaving?

278
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,914
You're eating too much dairy.

279
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,553
May I?

280
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,678
I guess so.

281
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,714
You see?

282
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,196
You are in disharmony.

283
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,430
The throat is the gateway to the lung.

284
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,672
Tonsillitis, adenoiditis is,
in Chinese medical terms...

285
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,592
...an invasion of heat and wind.

286
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,399
There's some hot air blowing
in here.

287
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,154
You know...

288
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,198
...I lived with the Eskimos
many years ago...

289
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,272
...and they used to plunge their faces
into the snow.

290
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,030
Can it be lukewarm?

291
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,839
Too much dairy? You really think
I'm eating too much dairy.

292
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,069
The tongue.

293
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,673
Yes, the tongue.

294
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,513
Or, in medical terms, the glossa.

295
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,033
It's a muscular organ.

296
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,553
Consists of two parts:

297
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,439
The body and the root.

298
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,396
You see, it's covered
by this mucous membrane.

299
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,518
These raised little projections here
are the papillae.

300
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,951
It's what gives it
its furred appearance.

301
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,348
Very tactile.

302
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,551
Your tea is ready now.

303
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,598
This will solve your so-called
tonsil problem.

304
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,353
It's a special concoction.

305
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,080
- It contains cramp bark.
- I love cramp bark.

306
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,834
Cleavers.

307
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,515
Cleaver? I once had cleaver as a kid.
I was able to lift a car.

308
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,273
And some couch grass.

309
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,510
Couch grass and cramp bark?

310
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,272
I think that's what killed Curly.

311
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,279
Go ahead, drink it, George.

312
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,671
Excuse me. Tor?

313
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,115
May I ask you a question?

314
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,555
You have intuitive abilities.

315
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,076
You're in touch with a lot
of cosmic kind of things.

316
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,915
I have this note I can't read.
I was wondering if...

317
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,392
Yes!

318
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,717
" Cleveland, 1 1 7. San Antonio, 1 09."

319
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,074
Go ahead, George, drink it.

320
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,072
It's not too bad.

321
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,038
I'm an eggplant!

322
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,714
I'm an eggplant! I'm a vegetable!

323
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,074
I didn't take your Chuckle!

324
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,516
I had five Chuckles. I ate the green
and the yellow. The red is missing.

325
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,399
- I don't even like Chuckles!
- Maybe he doesn't like them.

326
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,120
My face! My face!
Get me to the hospital!

327
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,679
I want that Chuckle, you hear?

328
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,512
You want me to get you a Chuckle?

329
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,079
- Pull over.
- Pull over?

330
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,151
- " Pull over"? You want a piece of me?
- Yeah!

331
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,390
- What, you're gonna fight?
- No! I'm a mutant!

332
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,274
- Let me drive.
- Come on, man, pull over!

333
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,317
All right. I'm gonna
mess you up, man!

334
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,754
Really, gentlemen, please.

335
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,353
My heart!

336
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,078
Where are you going?!
Are you crazy?!

337
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,356
- I'm gonna kick his ass!
- Hey, do you have keys?

338
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,750
You can't leave!
This is an ambulance!

339
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,559
- This is an emergency!
- I don't like Chuckles, man.

340
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,792
If I hear you one more time,
I'm gonna kill you!

341
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,952
- All this over a Chuckle.
- What's a Chuckle?

342
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,317
It's a jelly candy.
Comes in five flavours.

343
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,112
You see, taste buds run
on grooves along surfaces.

344
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,918
- Can you let go of my tongue now?
- What?

345
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,834
- Let go of my tongue.
- Oh, sorry.

346
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,911
Well, I should get going.

347
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,599
- What are you doing?
- I was gonna kiss you good night.

348
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,189
A kiss?

349
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,956
With the tongue? The glossa
with the bumps and the papillae?

350
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,232
I don't think so.

351
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,552
- You can't just leave him there.
- I told him I was gonna mess him up.

352
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,678
- Can you call him an ambulance?
- I told him I didn't take his Chuckle!

353
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,354
- I don't eat that gooey crap!
- Hey, watch the road.

354
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,988
- Watch the road, man.
- Hey, you want some of what he got?

355
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,276
- Hey, watch out!
- Watch out!

356
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,238
How you doing?

357
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,598
Can't talk?

358
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,072
Hey, how'd you get the plastic one?

359
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,992
I like that.

360
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,152
So how's life without tonsils?

361
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,512
What? What's that?

362
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,674
So how much is this thing gonna
cost you, like 5000, 6000?

363
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,797
Well, live and learn.
At least we lived.

364
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,750
Kramer went to Ackman.
He feels all better already.

365
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,831
What? What are you doing?

366
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,797
Oh, poor George.

367
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,636
I'm sorry, I can't stay long.
I don't want to run into Dr. Tongue.

368
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,875
Here, I brought you something.

369
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,753
See?

370
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,994
- Oh, please, come on. It's nothing.
- Hey, turn up the TV.

371
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,718
The planet's on fire!

372
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,950
It is just as you prophesised.

373
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,317
The planets of our solar system
incinerating...

374
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,357
...lik e flaming globes, Zigmond,
lik e flaming globes!

375
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,037
That's it! That's it!
" Flaming globes of Zigmond"!

376
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,352
That's my note.
That's what I thought was so funny.

377
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,636
It's not funny.

378
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,113
There's nothing funny about that.

379
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,271
Shut up!

380
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,230
I have a friend who's a hypochondriac.
Always thinks he's sick, never is.

381
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,038
Then you have another type
of person...

382
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,634
...always thinks they're well,
no matter how bad they are.

383
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,951
You know this type of person?
Very annoying. " Feel great.

384
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,634
I like being on a respirator.

385
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,395
Intravenous, heart-lung machine.
I never felt better in my life."

386
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,438
Medical science is making advances
every day to control health problems.

387
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,591
In fact, it's probably only
a matter of time...

388
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,593
...before a heart attack
becomes like a headache.

389
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,952
We'll just see people on TV going:

390
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,793
" I had a heart attack this big...

391
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,677
...but I gave myself
one of these: Clear!

392
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,117
And it's gone."

393
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,151
