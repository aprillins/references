1
00:00:02,343 --> 00:00:03,804
So I'm on the plane. We left late.

2
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:08,870
Pilot says, ''We're going to be making
up some time.'' Isn't that interesting?

3
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:10,241
They just make up time.

4
00:00:10,407 --> 00:00:12,196
That's why you have to
reset your watch.

5
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,623
Of course when they say
they're making up time...

6
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:18,303
...obviously, they're increasing
the speed of the aircraft.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,405
Now my question is,
if you can go faster...

8
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:24,444
...why don't you just go
as fast as you can...

9
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:26,141
...all the time?

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,052
Come on. There's no cops up here.
Nail it. Give it some gas.

11
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:32,287
We're flying.

12
00:00:36,518 --> 00:00:39,103
Traveling, of course,
is the best education.

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,480
You know, last year...

14
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:46,465
...I was ill for 40, 45 countries...

15
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,491
...and I would've gone to more,
but I'd just got a puppy.

16
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:52,865
And he was too young
to take with me.

17
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:55,484
But not now.
I won't travel without him.

18
00:00:55,653 --> 00:00:58,042
-Is he on the plane now?
-Oh, yes.

19
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,596
Yes, he's in
the baggage compartment.

20
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:05,147
I don't know why they won't
let him sit up here with me.

21
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:07,935
He's a lot better behaved
than most of the dregs...

22
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,435
...you find onboard here.

23
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:14,814
You have any pets?

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,442
Just my next-door neighbor.

25
00:01:16,612 --> 00:01:17,822
Well...

26
00:01:17,988 --> 00:01:20,322
...you are missing out
on a relationship...

27
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:24,859
...that could enrich your life in ways
that you never even thought possible.

28
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:28,192
How about picking up their--?
You know.

29
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:30,265
You find that enriching?

30
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:35,458
-What's the matter?
-Oh, I'm feeling a bit...

31
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:37,113
...queasy.

32
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:41,245
Sir, we're gonna make
an emergency landing in Chicago...

33
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:43,233
...and get you to a hospital.

34
00:01:43,747 --> 00:01:45,689
My dog.

35
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:47,266
What about my dog?

36
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:48,769
You have a dog?

37
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:50,786
Do you know anyone
on the plane, Mr. Palone?

38
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:58,041
Jerry.

39
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:00,000
How you feeling?

40
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,780
Would you take care of Farfel?

41
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,020
Farfel?

42
00:02:05,186 --> 00:02:08,001
It's his dog. We're landing in
Chicago to get him to a hospital.

43
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:11,773
-Could you take his dog to New York?
-The dog?

44
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:14,681
-The dog?
-I'm sure it's only for a day or two.

45
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,766
But, you know--
What if, you know...?

46
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,319
Give me your address
and phone number. I'll call you.

47
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,271
The dog?

48
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:26,975
Let go, Farfel.

49
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:28,796
Let go. Give me that.

50
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:32,026
Give me that sneaker,
you stupid idiot.

51
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:35,159
Shut up!

52
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:37,371
So, what would you do?

53
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:40,254
It's only been three days.
I'm sure he's gonna call.

54
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:43,510
Stop it! Shut up!

55
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:47,642
Do you believe this?
Do you believe what I'm dealing with?

56
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:49,630
I got a wild animal in the house.

57
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:53,272
He'd deranged. Maybe he's got
rabies. I can get lockjaw.

58
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:56,730
-lf only.
-Look at this place.

59
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,348
He's going everywhere.

60
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,716
I can't go out of the house at night.
I haven't performed in three days.

61
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,181
This will be my first night out
since I got back.

62
00:03:05,343 --> 00:03:08,278
Hey, when you walk him, do you...?

63
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:10,297
Do I what?

64
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:13,341
Do you pick it up?

65
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:17,016
Yes, I pick it up.

66
00:03:17,183 --> 00:03:19,452
-You pick it up?
-Well, you have to.

67
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:22,364
Oh, boy, would I love to see that.

68
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:26,389
Shut up!

69
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,729
Shut up, Farfel! Stop it!

70
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:30,323
I don't know what to do.

71
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:33,342
What if I take it to the pound,
then the guy shows up?

72
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:35,924
You should call the airline.
They might know where he is.

73
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:39,160
No, I tried. They don't know anything.
You gotta put the syrup in first.

74
00:03:39,326 --> 00:03:41,497
-No, milk.
-I'm telling you. The guy's a drunk.

75
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:43,604
He's probably on a bender.

76
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,291
What is a bender anyhow?

77
00:03:46,462 --> 00:03:49,724
I don't know. They drink and they
bend things at the bar. I don't know.

78
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:53,562
I can't believe he hasn't called.

79
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,252
Two hundred seats on a plane...

80
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:58,869
...I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack
and his dog Cujo.

81
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:02,295
Shut up!

82
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:04,795
One more day,
and you are pound-bound!

83
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:07,315
Hey, I'm sorry. I can't
watch the dog tonight.

84
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:09,459
-Why?
-We're going to the movies.

85
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,254
We're gonna see
<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

86
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:13,396
I can't. I gotta get this Ellen
out of my life.

87
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:16,182
-You're breaking up?
-Oh, yeah.

88
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:18,617
The sooner the better.
I can't wait to do it.

89
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,082
You know some people
you worry about whether or not...

90
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:24,343
...you're gonna hurt their feelings?
With her, I'm looking forward to it.

91
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:25,915
Boy, I'd like to get it on video.

92
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,930
Watch it in slow motion
and freeze-frame it.

93
00:04:31,516 --> 00:04:33,937
Kramer, I don't know how you
lasted as long as you did.

94
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:35,446
You didn't like her?

95
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:37,946
lf you could see her personality...

96
00:04:38,107 --> 00:04:40,278
...it'd be like one of the
Elephant Man exhibits...

97
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:43,094
...where they pull off the sheet
and everyone gasps.

98
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,041
I can't believe someone
hasn't killed her yet.

99
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,888
How come you never said anything?

100
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:50,644
You can't tell someone how you feel
about their girlfriend...

101
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:52,567
-...till after they stop--
-I tell you.

102
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:54,836
You. I'm talking about people.

103
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,486
Are we still going
to the movies tonight?

104
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:01,651
No, I can't. I gotta watch Farfel.
You and George can go without me.

105
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:04,375
-Just me and George?
-Sure.

106
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,815
But we need you.

107
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:07,571
What do you need me for?

108
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,451
Because.

109
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:14,928
-Yeah?
-<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

110
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:18,423
Because I relate to George
through you.

111
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,146
We're more like...

112
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:24,110
...friends-in-law. Besides, we said
we'd see <i>Prognosis Negative</i> together.

113
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:26,321
Can't you put some newspapers
down or something?

114
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,101
No, I can't trust him. He gets insane.
I won't enjoy myself.

115
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:33,233
That's right, Farfel,
I'm talking about you!

116
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,369
Just me and George alone?

117
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,614
Let's go, people. Let's go.
It's <i>Prognosis Negative</i> time.

118
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,470
I can't go.

119
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:46,832
-You can't go? Why not?
-Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.

120
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:50,389
-I thought Kramer was watching him.
-He's breaking up with his girlfriend.

121
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:52,439
What's the problem?
Just put newspaper down.

122
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,608
No, I don't want that smell
in the house.

123
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:57,013
-You spritz a little Lysol on it--
-No.

124
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:58,670
It's like BO and cologne.

125
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,996
They combine forces into some kind
of strange mutant funk.

126
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,404
So we're not going?

127
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:06,128
Nah. You two go.

128
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,796
You still wanna go?

129
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:14,605
Do you?

130
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:16,364
lf you want.

131
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,998
-It's-- It's up to you.
-Go ahead.

132
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:24,944
Well, I really wanted to see
<i>Prognosis Negative</i> with Jerry.

133
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,565
You wanna see <i>Ponce de Leon</i>?

134
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,840
<i>Ponce de Leon</i>?

135
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:31,605
Okay.

136
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,734
-You sure you don't wanna go?
-I want to, but I can't.

137
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:36,975
Oh! I tell you what.

138
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:40,175
How about if I come back here first
and I clean everything up?

139
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:43,026
And I open up the windows,
and if you're still not satisfied...

140
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,158
-...we switch apartments for the night.
-No.

141
00:06:47,638 --> 00:06:49,875
-What about this--?
-Forget it.

142
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:52,045
Go ahead. You'll have a good time.

143
00:06:52,214 --> 00:06:54,996
-I know. It's not that.
-I just want you to go.

144
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,389
Well, thank you very much.

145
00:06:58,005 --> 00:07:01,354
I'm telling you, one more day,
stink breath!

146
00:07:01,526 --> 00:07:03,914
On my block, a lot of people
walk their dogs...

147
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:07,468
...and I always see them walking
along with their little poop bags...

148
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:10,354
...which to me is just
the lowest function of human life.

149
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:14,030
lf aliens are watching this
through telescopes...

150
00:07:14,197 --> 00:07:17,044
...they're gonna think the dogs
are the leaders.

151
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:20,370
lf you see two life forms,
one of them is making a poop...

152
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,467
...the other one's carrying it for him....

153
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:26,957
Who would you assume
is in charge?

154
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:35,855
So how long did you live there?

155
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,194
About three years.

156
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:41,834
That's pretty long.

157
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:47,858
-It's not that long, really.
-Yeah.

158
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:50,892
-Do you--?
-So--

159
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:55,725
-And then you came here.
-Yeah.

160
00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:00,778
So I've been here about six years.

161
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:06,506
'86, '87, '88, '89, '90...

162
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:08,911
...'<i>9</i>1 .

163
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:11,855
Yep.

164
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:13,295
Bad dog.

165
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,669
Bad dog!

166
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:16,395
You go outside!

167
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,450
Outside!

168
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,977
What do you want from me? Tell me.

169
00:08:21,138 --> 00:08:23,080
Money? You want money?

170
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,908
I'll give you money. How much?

171
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:29,230
I must have been out of my mind.
Look at you.

172
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:31,947
Why don't you do something
with your life?

173
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:36,423
You sit around here all day.
You contribute nothing to society!

174
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:39,910
You're just taking up space!

175
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:44,165
I mean, how can I be
with someone like you?

176
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,047
Wouldn't respect myself.

177
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:50,566
I like herbal tea.

178
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:55,019
Chamomile's good.

179
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:59,151
Lemon Lift.

180
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:03,503
Almond Pleasure.

181
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:19,623
Jerry likes Morning Thunder.

182
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:24,394
-Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
-Yeah.

183
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,855
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.

184
00:09:28,015 --> 00:09:30,600
Jerry doesn't know
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.

185
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:34,149
-You don't tell him?
-No.

186
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,556
And you should see him.
Man, he gets all hyper.

187
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,606
He doesn't even know why.
He loves it.

188
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:41,385
He walks around going,
''God, I feel great!''

189
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:45,382
-You don't tell him?
-No.

190
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:49,226
-That is so funny.
-I know.

191
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:50,989
Have you ever seen him throw up?

192
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:56,621
Please!

193
00:09:57,517 --> 00:09:59,459
Please!

194
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:02,182
I take it all back!

195
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,903
Everything. I take it all back!
Every word!

196
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,979
I love you!

197
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:09,643
I love you!

198
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:13,995
I can't live without you!
I'll do anything!

199
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:19,781
That's right. Gavin Palone.

200
00:10:19,948 --> 00:10:22,534
What? You're sure?

201
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:24,195
He was released on Monday?

202
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:26,339
Last Monday?

203
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,635
Did he leave a phone number
or address?

204
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:31,977
Unbelievable.

205
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,235
Well, thank you. Thanks.
Thanks very much.

206
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:39,363
That's it, Farfel. Party's over.

207
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:44,267
Start packing up your little squeeze
toys, buddy boy. You're checking out.

208
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,667
It was weird because George
and I get along so great...

209
00:10:50,827 --> 00:10:52,038
...in so many situations...

210
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:54,724
...but this was the first time
we went one-on-one.

211
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:57,706
One-on-one's a whole
different game. Can't pass off.

212
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,088
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable
was when we were making fun of you.

213
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:09,026
Hello. Boy George, about time.

214
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:10,886
Beautiful. How soon?

215
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:12,577
Okay, here's the plan:

216
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:16,575
We take the dog to the pound,
we go right to the movies.

217
00:11:16,746 --> 00:11:19,080
Right. You, me and Elaine.

218
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:21,382
Yes, all three of us.

219
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,322
I am going.

220
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,824
Okay, see you in five minutes.

221
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:36,003
-What?
-Do you have to?

222
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,952
What am I supposed to do?
I don't want to do it.

223
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:41,023
I like dogs.

224
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:43,364
I'm not sure this is a dog.

225
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:46,402
You know the guy might have
just lost your number.

226
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:48,871
I'm in the book,
and I have a machine.

227
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:52,382
Jerry, do you know what they do
to dogs at the pound?

228
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:55,902
They keep them there for a week.
lf nobody claims them, they kill them.

229
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:57,382
Really?

230
00:11:57,545 --> 00:11:59,268
How late are they open?

231
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:06,720
-What?
-What is it?

232
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:09,543
I went back with Ellen.

233
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:12,159
-That's great.
-Great.

234
00:12:13,736 --> 00:12:15,230
-Terrific.
-Yeah.

235
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,407
I really think you guys
are good together.

236
00:12:17,576 --> 00:12:21,504
Yes. She understands you,
and she is not demanding.

237
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:25,446
Do you think that I forgot
what you two said about her?

238
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:28,062
-We're just trying to be supportive.
-Yes.

239
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:29,987
-We knew you were upset--
-From now on...

240
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:32,868
...when we pass each other,
I don't know you, you don't know me.

241
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:35,998
Oh, Kramer. We didn't mean it.

242
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:38,817
-What are you doing?
-I'm getting my pot.

243
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,980
-Kramer, we like her.
-Kramer....

244
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,406
What did we say that was so bad?

245
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:51,553
I believe I referred to her personality
as a potential science exhibit.

246
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:54,752
I said, ''How come
no one's killed her?''

247
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:58,017
-Well.
-Well.

248
00:12:58,182 --> 00:12:59,906
Probably shouldn't have
said anything.

249
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,655
I mean, everybody knows
the first breakup never takes.

250
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:08,737
-Yeah?
-<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

251
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:15,678
Great. Okay, Farfel,
put your shoes on.

252
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:19,040
Jerry, can't you just give it
one more day?

253
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:21,726
-It's not his fault.
-It's not my dog.

254
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:23,747
I don't know where
this booze hound is.

255
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:26,978
All right, I tell you what.

256
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,562
How about if you and George
go to the movies...

257
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,259
...and I stay here
and watch the dog?

258
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:33,917
I can't let you do that.
What about <i>Prognosis Negative</i>?

259
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:35,994
We'll see it Sunday.

260
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:39,963
Tonight's the night, right?
<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

261
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,717
I'm not going.
I'm gonna watch the dog.

262
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:44,960
-What does this mean?
-Well...

263
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:49,347
...we'll go see something else tonight.
We'll see <i>Ponce de Leon</i>.

264
00:13:49,508 --> 00:13:52,410
What is with this dog? I thought
we were taking it to the pound.

265
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,205
She talked me into one more day.

266
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:55,997
Talk. I'm going to the bathroom.

267
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:58,585
Jerry, how long are you
gonna be in there?

268
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:02,435
I don't know, regular human time.

269
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:04,984
Why don't you wait
and go at the movies?

270
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:09,793
-Why shouldn't I go here?
-Well, you know.

271
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:12,737
Sometimes it's good to get there
and make sure you get seats...

272
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,328
...and then go to the bathroom.

273
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:16,637
-And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
-Yeah.

274
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:21,498
Oh, yeah, George. Urinals are fun.

275
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:25,208
-Can I go?
-Hey, go.

276
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:28,062
-Who's stopping you?
-What, are you doing me a favor?

277
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:31,931
Like we care if you go
to the bathroom.

278
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,641
-How's it going?
-Good.

279
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:43,770
-You?
-Things are good.

280
00:14:57,633 --> 00:15:00,731
-Boy, he takes such a long time.
-I know.

281
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,992
You know what he does
in there? He gargles.

282
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:05,983
Jerry gargles?
That why he takes so long?

283
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:08,152
Yeah, he does it
like six times a day.

284
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:10,911
-How come we never hear him?
-Because he does it quiet.

285
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:13,941
He does it quiet. Lookit--
Just like this. Watch.

286
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:22,428
Wait, wait. Did you ever
see him throw up?

287
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,527
We talked about that already.

288
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:31,863
I have nothing to say
to anybody anymore.

289
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:34,748
I'm so uninteresting.

290
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:36,373
I'm think I'm out of conversation.

291
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,036
So why do you call me
six times a day?

292
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,694
All I know about is sports. That's it.

293
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:43,994
No matter how depressed,
I can always read sports.

294
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,745
I could read the sports section
if my hair was on fire.

295
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,585
You know what,
<i>Ponce de Leon</i> is sold out.

296
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:54,428
It is. Oh, yeah, you're right.
What else is playing?

297
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:56,663
Nothing except <i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

298
00:15:58,047 --> 00:16:00,348
Boy, I know she really wants
to see that with me.

299
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,136
Give me that jacket, mud face.

300
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:04,090
This is not Seinfeld
you're dealing with.

301
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,222
When I get through with you,
you'll be begging to go to the pound.

302
00:16:09,725 --> 00:16:11,067
Shut up.

303
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,244
Shut up!

304
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:15,865
Hello?

305
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:18,995
No. Who's calling?

306
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:24,604
Oh, my God. The dog guy.

307
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:26,872
Well, where have you been?

308
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,068
Yeah? Well, you better pick up
your dog tonight...

309
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:32,376
...or he has humped his last leg.

310
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,874
I could understand if there was
something else playing...

311
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:39,833
...but it's this or nothing.

312
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:42,903
-I don't know what to do.
-What is this saving movies thing?

313
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,436
-Something's playing, you go.
-I know. I know.

314
00:16:45,597 --> 00:16:46,906
So we're gonna do nothing now?

315
00:16:47,068 --> 00:16:48,693
-This is crazy.
-It is kind of silly.

316
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,249
-Of course it is.
-I mean, it's just a movie--

317
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,071
-Exactly.
-It's not like she's in the movie.

318
00:16:54,236 --> 00:16:55,447
Right.

319
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:58,099
We're supposed to ruin the night
because she wants to see it?

320
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,959
lf I could have seen it
with her, fine.

321
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:02,513
But I can't control these
circumstances and schedules...

322
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:05,072
-...and people's availabilities.
-She'll still see it.

323
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:07,993
-You're not stopping her--
-How does sitting next to a person...

324
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:10,065
...in a movie theater
increase the enjoyment?

325
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:12,210
You can't talk during a movie.

326
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,702
This is stupid. Come on.

327
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:17,274
-Let's just go.
-Good.

328
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:20,409
-Saving movies.
-Ridiculous.

329
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:23,026
Two for <i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

330
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:28,176
-I'm in big trouble.
-Oh, you're dead.

331
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:32,979
Bell's Palsy.

332
00:17:33,146 --> 00:17:37,040
The entire side of--
Of my face...

333
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,414
...was paralyzed.

334
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:41,171
Farfel.

335
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:45,104
You know, I couldn't-- I couldn't--
I couldn't even feed myself.

336
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,542
I was completely incapacitated.

337
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:49,618
Quiet, Farfel!

338
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:51,029
-Farfel.
-It's interesting...

339
00:17:51,193 --> 00:17:52,688
...because I called the hospital...

340
00:17:52,857 --> 00:17:54,767
...and they said you were
released on Monday.

341
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:57,582
Yes, that's true...

342
00:17:57,753 --> 00:18:03,055
...but then, see, I was taken
to the Bell's Palsy Center.

343
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:05,744
In-- In Rockville.

344
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:08,499
Absolutely first--
First-rate facility.

345
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:11,348
Top-- Top-notch physicians.

346
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,222
Hey, come on. Come on.
Get off me.

347
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,694
He won't hurt you. He's just playing.

348
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:18,479
Now you keep that mutt
away from me.

349
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:21,997
Mutt? I'll wager his parents
are more pure than yours.

350
00:18:23,257 --> 00:18:24,850
Kramer, are you coming?

351
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:27,700
-Oh, hi, Ellen.
-Get in here.

352
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:34,743
Listen, it's been a pleasure
taking care of your dog for a week...

353
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:36,791
...but if you don't mind....

354
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:40,880
Prediction: You'll be calling me to ask
if you can come and visit him...

355
00:18:41,047 --> 00:18:42,738
...before the month is out.

356
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:47,212
Prediction: I never see you
or him again for the rest of my life.

357
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:54,448
We made plans.

358
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:56,691
Why don't we just rent a movie?

359
00:18:56,855 --> 00:18:59,538
I thought you wanted to see
<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

360
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:04,656
No. It's supposed to be
really bad. Really bad.

361
00:19:04,823 --> 00:19:07,539
I mean, it's long. There's no story.

362
00:19:07,702 --> 00:19:12,045
It's so unbelievably boring--
I heard. l....

363
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:15,373
Jerry, you promised me we'd go.

364
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:18,608
Well, George told me
the whole story, line for line.

365
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:22,222
I almost feel like I've seen it already
and walked out on it.

366
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,513
Wait. George saw the movie? I saw
him yesterday. He didn't mention it.

367
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:28,818
You and George got together?

368
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:32,397
Yeah. I wanted to talk about how
we had nothing to talk about.

369
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:35,440
Hello.

370
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:36,882
Hi, hi, hi.

371
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:38,255
		

372
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:39,915
Well, you were right.

373
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:41,994
-About what?
-Ellen.

374
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:44,718
We broke up again.

375
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:47,338
Too bad.

376
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:50,127
I thought she was the one.

377
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:53,483
I'll bring back the pot.

378
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,046
Okay, come on. It's movie time.

379
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:58,317
-Hey, what are you gonna see?
-<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

380
00:19:58,484 --> 00:20:00,175
-That's supposed to be great.
-It's not.

381
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,275
-Well, how do you know?
-I have an instinct for these things.

382
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:06,892
I had a parakeet when I was a kid.
That was the only pet I really enjoyed.

383
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,813
We used to let him out of his cage...

384
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,435
...and he would fly around.
And my mother had built--

385
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:14,800
One entire wall of our living room
was mirrored...

386
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,971
...she felt this gives you
a feeling of space.

387
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,311
Have you ever heard this
interior-design principle?

388
00:20:19,475 --> 00:20:21,711
The mirror makes it seem like
you have another room.

389
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,282
Who walks up
to a mirror and goes:

390
00:20:23,443 --> 00:20:26,378
''Hey, look. There's a whole
other room in there.

391
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:29,806
There's a guy in there,
looks just like me''?

392
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:34,956
But the parakeet will fall for this.
You let him out. He flies around.

393
00:20:35,123 --> 00:20:38,472
Bang! With his little head.
He would just go:

394
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:41,938
I'd always think, even if he thinks
the mirror is another room...

395
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:46,512
...why doesn't he at least try and
avoid hitting the other parakeet?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
1
00:00:02,343 --> 00:00:03,804
So I'm on the plane. We left late.

2
00:00:05,095 --> 00:00:08,870
Pilot says, ''We're going to be making
up some time.'' Isn't that interesting?

3
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:10,241
They just make up time.

4
00:00:10,407 --> 00:00:12,196
That's why you have to
reset your watch.

5
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:14,623
Of course when they say
they're making up time...

6
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:18,303
...obviously, they're increasing
the speed of the aircraft.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:21,405
Now my question is,
if you can go faster...

8
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:24,444
...why don't you just go
as fast as you can...

9
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:26,141
...all the time?

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,052
Come on. There's no cops up here.
Nail it. Give it some gas.

11
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:32,287
We're flying.

12
00:00:36,518 --> 00:00:39,103
Traveling, of course,
is the best education.

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,480
You know, last year...

14
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:46,465
...I was ill for 40, 45 countries...

15
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,491
...and I would've gone to more,
but I'd just got a puppy.

16
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:52,865
And he was too young
to take with me.

17
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:55,484
But not now.
I won't travel without him.

18
00:00:55,653 --> 00:00:58,042
-Is he on the plane now?
-Oh, yes.

19
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,596
Yes, he's in
the baggage compartment.

20
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:05,147
I don't know why they won't
let him sit up here with me.

21
00:01:05,317 --> 00:01:07,935
He's a lot better behaved
than most of the dregs...

22
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:10,435
...you find onboard here.

23
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:14,814
You have any pets?

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,442
Just my next-door neighbor.

25
00:01:16,612 --> 00:01:17,822
Well...

26
00:01:17,988 --> 00:01:20,322
...you are missing out
on a relationship...

27
00:01:20,484 --> 00:01:24,859
...that could enrich your life in ways
that you never even thought possible.

28
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:28,192
How about picking up their--?
You know.

29
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:30,265
You find that enriching?

30
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:35,458
-What's the matter?
-Oh, I'm feeling a bit...

31
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:37,113
...queasy.

32
00:01:38,595 --> 00:01:41,245
Sir, we're gonna make
an emergency landing in Chicago...

33
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:43,233
...and get you to a hospital.

34
00:01:43,747 --> 00:01:45,689
My dog.

35
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:47,266
What about my dog?

36
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:48,769
You have a dog?

37
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:50,786
Do you know anyone
on the plane, Mr. Palone?

38
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:58,041
Jerry.

39
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:00,000
How you feeling?

40
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,780
Would you take care of Farfel?

41
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,020
Farfel?

42
00:02:05,186 --> 00:02:08,001
It's his dog. We're landing in
Chicago to get him to a hospital.

43
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:11,773
-Could you take his dog to New York?
-The dog?

44
00:02:12,193 --> 00:02:14,681
-The dog?
-I'm sure it's only for a day or two.

45
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,766
But, you know--
What if, you know...?

46
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,319
Give me your address
and phone number. I'll call you.

47
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,271
The dog?

48
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:26,975
Let go, Farfel.

49
00:02:27,137 --> 00:02:28,796
Let go. Give me that.

50
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:32,026
Give me that sneaker,
you stupid idiot.

51
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:35,159
Shut up!

52
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:37,371
So, what would you do?

53
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:40,254
It's only been three days.
I'm sure he's gonna call.

54
00:02:41,088 --> 00:02:43,510
Stop it! Shut up!

55
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:47,642
Do you believe this?
Do you believe what I'm dealing with?

56
00:02:47,808 --> 00:02:49,630
I got a wild animal in the house.

57
00:02:49,792 --> 00:02:53,272
He'd deranged. Maybe he's got
rabies. I can get lockjaw.

58
00:02:54,112 --> 00:02:56,730
-lf only.
-Look at this place.

59
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,348
He's going everywhere.

60
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,716
I can't go out of the house at night.
I haven't performed in three days.

61
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,181
This will be my first night out
since I got back.

62
00:03:05,343 --> 00:03:08,278
Hey, when you walk him, do you...?

63
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:10,297
Do I what?

64
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:13,341
Do you pick it up?

65
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:17,016
Yes, I pick it up.

66
00:03:17,183 --> 00:03:19,452
-You pick it up?
-Well, you have to.

67
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:22,364
Oh, boy, would I love to see that.

68
00:03:24,863 --> 00:03:26,389
Shut up!

69
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,729
Shut up, Farfel! Stop it!

70
00:03:28,894 --> 00:03:30,323
I don't know what to do.

71
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:33,342
What if I take it to the pound,
then the guy shows up?

72
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:35,924
You should call the airline.
They might know where he is.

73
00:03:36,094 --> 00:03:39,160
No, I tried. They don't know anything.
You gotta put the syrup in first.

74
00:03:39,326 --> 00:03:41,497
-No, milk.
-I'm telling you. The guy's a drunk.

75
00:03:41,662 --> 00:03:43,604
He's probably on a bender.

76
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,291
What is a bender anyhow?

77
00:03:46,462 --> 00:03:49,724
I don't know. They drink and they
bend things at the bar. I don't know.

78
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:53,562
I can't believe he hasn't called.

79
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:55,252
Two hundred seats on a plane...

80
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:58,869
...I gotta wind up next to Yukon Jack
and his dog Cujo.

81
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:02,295
Shut up!

82
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:04,795
One more day,
and you are pound-bound!

83
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:07,315
Hey, I'm sorry. I can't
watch the dog tonight.

84
00:04:07,484 --> 00:04:09,459
-Why?
-We're going to the movies.

85
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,254
We're gonna see
<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

86
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:13,396
I can't. I gotta get this Ellen
out of my life.

87
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:16,182
-You're breaking up?
-Oh, yeah.

88
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:18,617
The sooner the better.
I can't wait to do it.

89
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,082
You know some people
you worry about whether or not...

90
00:04:21,244 --> 00:04:24,343
...you're gonna hurt their feelings?
With her, I'm looking forward to it.

91
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:25,915
Boy, I'd like to get it on video.

92
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,930
Watch it in slow motion
and freeze-frame it.

93
00:04:31,516 --> 00:04:33,937
Kramer, I don't know how you
lasted as long as you did.

94
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:35,446
You didn't like her?

95
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:37,946
lf you could see her personality...

96
00:04:38,107 --> 00:04:40,278
...it'd be like one of the
Elephant Man exhibits...

97
00:04:40,443 --> 00:04:43,094
...where they pull off the sheet
and everyone gasps.

98
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,041
I can't believe someone
hasn't killed her yet.

99
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,888
How come you never said anything?

100
00:04:48,059 --> 00:04:50,644
You can't tell someone how you feel
about their girlfriend...

101
00:04:50,811 --> 00:04:52,567
-...till after they stop--
-I tell you.

102
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:54,836
You. I'm talking about people.

103
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,486
Are we still going
to the movies tonight?

104
00:04:58,651 --> 00:05:01,651
No, I can't. I gotta watch Farfel.
You and George can go without me.

105
00:05:02,106 --> 00:05:04,375
-Just me and George?
-Sure.

106
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,815
But we need you.

107
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:07,571
What do you need me for?

108
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,451
Because.

109
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:14,928
-Yeah?
-<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

110
00:05:15,674 --> 00:05:18,423
Because I relate to George
through you.

111
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:20,146
We're more like...

112
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:24,110
...friends-in-law. Besides, we said
we'd see <i>Prognosis Negative</i> together.

113
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:26,321
Can't you put some newspapers
down or something?

114
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:30,101
No, I can't trust him. He gets insane.
I won't enjoy myself.

115
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:33,233
That's right, Farfel,
I'm talking about you!

116
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:36,369
Just me and George alone?

117
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:41,614
Let's go, people. Let's go.
It's <i>Prognosis Negative</i> time.

118
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,470
I can't go.

119
00:05:43,832 --> 00:05:46,832
-You can't go? Why not?
-Because I have to watch idiot Farfel.

120
00:05:47,193 --> 00:05:50,389
-I thought Kramer was watching him.
-He's breaking up with his girlfriend.

121
00:05:50,552 --> 00:05:52,439
What's the problem?
Just put newspaper down.

122
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,608
No, I don't want that smell
in the house.

123
00:05:54,776 --> 00:05:57,013
-You spritz a little Lysol on it--
-No.

124
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:58,670
It's like BO and cologne.

125
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,996
They combine forces into some kind
of strange mutant funk.

126
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,404
So we're not going?

127
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:06,128
Nah. You two go.

128
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,796
You still wanna go?

129
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:14,605
Do you?

130
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:16,364
lf you want.

131
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,998
-It's-- It's up to you.
-Go ahead.

132
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:24,944
Well, I really wanted to see
<i>Prognosis Negative</i> with Jerry.

133
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,565
You wanna see <i>Ponce de Leon</i>?

134
00:06:27,735 --> 00:06:29,840
<i>Ponce de Leon</i>?

135
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:31,605
Okay.

136
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,734
-You sure you don't wanna go?
-I want to, but I can't.

137
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:36,975
Oh! I tell you what.

138
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:40,175
How about if I come back here first
and I clean everything up?

139
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:43,026
And I open up the windows,
and if you're still not satisfied...

140
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:46,158
-...we switch apartments for the night.
-No.

141
00:06:47,638 --> 00:06:49,875
-What about this--?
-Forget it.

142
00:06:50,038 --> 00:06:52,045
Go ahead. You'll have a good time.

143
00:06:52,214 --> 00:06:54,996
-I know. It's not that.
-I just want you to go.

144
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:57,389
Well, thank you very much.

145
00:06:58,005 --> 00:07:01,354
I'm telling you, one more day,
stink breath!

146
00:07:01,526 --> 00:07:03,914
On my block, a lot of people
walk their dogs...

147
00:07:04,085 --> 00:07:07,468
...and I always see them walking
along with their little poop bags...

148
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:10,354
...which to me is just
the lowest function of human life.

149
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:14,030
lf aliens are watching this
through telescopes...

150
00:07:14,197 --> 00:07:17,044
...they're gonna think the dogs
are the leaders.

151
00:07:17,653 --> 00:07:20,370
lf you see two life forms,
one of them is making a poop...

152
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:23,467
...the other one's carrying it for him....

153
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:26,957
Who would you assume
is in charge?

154
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:35,855
So how long did you live there?

155
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,194
About three years.

156
00:07:40,308 --> 00:07:41,834
That's pretty long.

157
00:07:45,524 --> 00:07:47,858
-It's not that long, really.
-Yeah.

158
00:07:49,332 --> 00:07:50,892
-Do you--?
-So--

159
00:07:53,075 --> 00:07:55,725
-And then you came here.
-Yeah.

160
00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:00,778
So I've been here about six years.

161
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:06,506
'86, '87, '88, '89, '90...

162
00:08:06,674 --> 00:08:08,911
...'<i>9</i>1 .

163
00:08:10,578 --> 00:08:11,855
Yep.

164
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:13,295
Bad dog.

165
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,669
Bad dog!

166
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:16,395
You go outside!

167
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,450
Outside!

168
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,977
What do you want from me? Tell me.

169
00:08:21,138 --> 00:08:23,080
Money? You want money?

170
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,908
I'll give you money. How much?

171
00:08:25,074 --> 00:08:29,230
I must have been out of my mind.
Look at you.

172
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:31,947
Why don't you do something
with your life?

173
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:36,423
You sit around here all day.
You contribute nothing to society!

174
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:39,910
You're just taking up space!

175
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:44,165
I mean, how can I be
with someone like you?

176
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,047
Wouldn't respect myself.

177
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:50,566
I like herbal tea.

178
00:08:52,848 --> 00:08:55,019
Chamomile's good.

179
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:59,151
Lemon Lift.

180
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:03,503
Almond Pleasure.

181
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:19,623
Jerry likes Morning Thunder.

182
00:09:21,743 --> 00:09:24,394
-Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?
-Yeah.

183
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,855
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.
Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.

184
00:09:28,015 --> 00:09:30,600
Jerry doesn't know
Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.

185
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:34,149
-You don't tell him?
-No.

186
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:36,556
And you should see him.
Man, he gets all hyper.

187
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,606
He doesn't even know why.
He loves it.

188
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:41,385
He walks around going,
''God, I feel great!''

189
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:45,382
-You don't tell him?
-No.

190
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:49,226
-That is so funny.
-I know.

191
00:09:49,614 --> 00:09:50,989
Have you ever seen him throw up?

192
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:56,621
Please!

193
00:09:57,517 --> 00:09:59,459
Please!

194
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:02,182
I take it all back!

195
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,903
Everything. I take it all back!
Every word!

196
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,979
I love you!

197
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:09,643
I love you!

198
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:13,995
I can't live without you!
I'll do anything!

199
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:19,781
That's right. Gavin Palone.

200
00:10:19,948 --> 00:10:22,534
What? You're sure?

201
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:24,195
He was released on Monday?

202
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:26,339
Last Monday?

203
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,635
Did he leave a phone number
or address?

204
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:31,977
Unbelievable.

205
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,235
Well, thank you. Thanks.
Thanks very much.

206
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:39,363
That's it, Farfel. Party's over.

207
00:10:39,532 --> 00:10:44,267
Start packing up your little squeeze
toys, buddy boy. You're checking out.

208
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,667
It was weird because George
and I get along so great...

209
00:10:50,827 --> 00:10:52,038
...in so many situations...

210
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:54,724
...but this was the first time
we went one-on-one.

211
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:57,706
One-on-one's a whole
different game. Can't pass off.

212
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,088
The only time it wasn't uncomfortable
was when we were making fun of you.

213
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:09,026
Hello. Boy George, about time.

214
00:11:09,195 --> 00:11:10,886
Beautiful. How soon?

215
00:11:11,051 --> 00:11:12,577
Okay, here's the plan:

216
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:16,575
We take the dog to the pound,
we go right to the movies.

217
00:11:16,746 --> 00:11:19,080
Right. You, me and Elaine.

218
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:21,382
Yes, all three of us.

219
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,322
I am going.

220
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,824
Okay, see you in five minutes.

221
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:36,003
-What?
-Do you have to?

222
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,952
What am I supposed to do?
I don't want to do it.

223
00:11:39,114 --> 00:11:41,023
I like dogs.

224
00:11:41,193 --> 00:11:43,364
I'm not sure this is a dog.

225
00:11:44,297 --> 00:11:46,402
You know the guy might have
just lost your number.

226
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:48,871
I'm in the book,
and I have a machine.

227
00:11:49,033 --> 00:11:52,382
Jerry, do you know what they do
to dogs at the pound?

228
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:55,902
They keep them there for a week.
lf nobody claims them, they kill them.

229
00:11:56,073 --> 00:11:57,382
Really?

230
00:11:57,545 --> 00:11:59,268
How late are they open?

231
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:06,720
-What?
-What is it?

232
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:09,543
I went back with Ellen.

233
00:12:10,632 --> 00:12:12,159
-That's great.
-Great.

234
00:12:13,736 --> 00:12:15,230
-Terrific.
-Yeah.

235
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,407
I really think you guys
are good together.

236
00:12:17,576 --> 00:12:21,504
Yes. She understands you,
and she is not demanding.

237
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:25,446
Do you think that I forgot
what you two said about her?

238
00:12:25,607 --> 00:12:28,062
-We're just trying to be supportive.
-Yes.

239
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:29,987
-We knew you were upset--
-From now on...

240
00:12:30,151 --> 00:12:32,868
...when we pass each other,
I don't know you, you don't know me.

241
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:35,998
Oh, Kramer. We didn't mean it.

242
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:38,817
-What are you doing?
-I'm getting my pot.

243
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:41,980
-Kramer, we like her.
-Kramer....

244
00:12:44,039 --> 00:12:46,406
What did we say that was so bad?

245
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:51,553
I believe I referred to her personality
as a potential science exhibit.

246
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:54,752
I said, ''How come
no one's killed her?''

247
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:58,017
-Well.
-Well.

248
00:12:58,182 --> 00:12:59,906
Probably shouldn't have
said anything.

249
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,655
I mean, everybody knows
the first breakup never takes.

250
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:08,737
-Yeah?
-<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

251
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:15,678
Great. Okay, Farfel,
put your shoes on.

252
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:19,040
Jerry, can't you just give it
one more day?

253
00:13:19,206 --> 00:13:21,726
-It's not his fault.
-It's not my dog.

254
00:13:21,893 --> 00:13:23,747
I don't know where
this booze hound is.

255
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:26,978
All right, I tell you what.

256
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,562
How about if you and George
go to the movies...

257
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,259
...and I stay here
and watch the dog?

258
00:13:31,429 --> 00:13:33,917
I can't let you do that.
What about <i>Prognosis Negative</i>?

259
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:35,994
We'll see it Sunday.

260
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:39,963
Tonight's the night, right?
<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

261
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,717
I'm not going.
I'm gonna watch the dog.

262
00:13:43,236 --> 00:13:44,960
-What does this mean?
-Well...

263
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:49,347
...we'll go see something else tonight.
We'll see <i>Ponce de Leon</i>.

264
00:13:49,508 --> 00:13:52,410
What is with this dog? I thought
we were taking it to the pound.

265
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,205
She talked me into one more day.

266
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:55,997
Talk. I'm going to the bathroom.

267
00:13:56,164 --> 00:13:58,585
Jerry, how long are you
gonna be in there?

268
00:13:59,587 --> 00:14:02,435
I don't know, regular human time.

269
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:04,984
Why don't you wait
and go at the movies?

270
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:09,793
-Why shouldn't I go here?
-Well, you know.

271
00:14:09,955 --> 00:14:12,737
Sometimes it's good to get there
and make sure you get seats...

272
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,328
...and then go to the bathroom.

273
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:16,637
-And isn't it more fun using the urinal?
-Yeah.

274
00:14:18,978 --> 00:14:21,498
Oh, yeah, George. Urinals are fun.

275
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:25,208
-Can I go?
-Hey, go.

276
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:28,062
-Who's stopping you?
-What, are you doing me a favor?

277
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:31,931
Like we care if you go
to the bathroom.

278
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,641
-How's it going?
-Good.

279
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:43,770
-You?
-Things are good.

280
00:14:57,633 --> 00:15:00,731
-Boy, he takes such a long time.
-I know.

281
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,992
You know what he does
in there? He gargles.

282
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:05,983
Jerry gargles?
That why he takes so long?

283
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:08,152
Yeah, he does it
like six times a day.

284
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:10,911
-How come we never hear him?
-Because he does it quiet.

285
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:13,941
He does it quiet. Lookit--
Just like this. Watch.

286
00:15:19,744 --> 00:15:22,428
Wait, wait. Did you ever
see him throw up?

287
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,527
We talked about that already.

288
00:15:29,856 --> 00:15:31,863
I have nothing to say
to anybody anymore.

289
00:15:32,511 --> 00:15:34,748
I'm so uninteresting.

290
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:36,373
I'm think I'm out of conversation.

291
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,036
So why do you call me
six times a day?

292
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,694
All I know about is sports. That's it.

293
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:43,994
No matter how depressed,
I can always read sports.

294
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,745
I could read the sports section
if my hair was on fire.

295
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,585
You know what,
<i>Ponce de Leon</i> is sold out.

296
00:15:52,127 --> 00:15:54,428
It is. Oh, yeah, you're right.
What else is playing?

297
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:56,663
Nothing except <i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

298
00:15:58,047 --> 00:16:00,348
Boy, I know she really wants
to see that with me.

299
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,136
Give me that jacket, mud face.

300
00:16:02,302 --> 00:16:04,090
This is not Seinfeld
you're dealing with.

301
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,222
When I get through with you,
you'll be begging to go to the pound.

302
00:16:09,725 --> 00:16:11,067
Shut up.

303
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,244
Shut up!

304
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:15,865
Hello?

305
00:16:16,574 --> 00:16:18,995
No. Who's calling?

306
00:16:21,757 --> 00:16:24,604
Oh, my God. The dog guy.

307
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:26,872
Well, where have you been?

308
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,068
Yeah? Well, you better pick up
your dog tonight...

309
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:32,376
...or he has humped his last leg.

310
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,874
I could understand if there was
something else playing...

311
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:39,833
...but it's this or nothing.

312
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:42,903
-I don't know what to do.
-What is this saving movies thing?

313
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,436
-Something's playing, you go.
-I know. I know.

314
00:16:45,597 --> 00:16:46,906
So we're gonna do nothing now?

315
00:16:47,068 --> 00:16:48,693
-This is crazy.
-It is kind of silly.

316
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,249
-Of course it is.
-I mean, it's just a movie--

317
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,071
-Exactly.
-It's not like she's in the movie.

318
00:16:54,236 --> 00:16:55,447
Right.

319
00:16:55,612 --> 00:16:58,099
We're supposed to ruin the night
because she wants to see it?

320
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,959
lf I could have seen it
with her, fine.

321
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:02,513
But I can't control these
circumstances and schedules...

322
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:05,072
-...and people's availabilities.
-She'll still see it.

323
00:17:05,244 --> 00:17:07,993
-You're not stopping her--
-How does sitting next to a person...

324
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:10,065
...in a movie theater
increase the enjoyment?

325
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:12,210
You can't talk during a movie.

326
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,702
This is stupid. Come on.

327
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:17,274
-Let's just go.
-Good.

328
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:20,409
-Saving movies.
-Ridiculous.

329
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:23,026
Two for <i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

330
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:28,176
-I'm in big trouble.
-Oh, you're dead.

331
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:32,979
Bell's Palsy.

332
00:17:33,146 --> 00:17:37,040
The entire side of--
Of my face...

333
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,414
...was paralyzed.

334
00:17:39,578 --> 00:17:41,171
Farfel.

335
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:45,104
You know, I couldn't-- I couldn't--
I couldn't even feed myself.

336
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:47,542
I was completely incapacitated.

337
00:17:48,057 --> 00:17:49,618
Quiet, Farfel!

338
00:17:49,786 --> 00:17:51,029
-Farfel.
-It's interesting...

339
00:17:51,193 --> 00:17:52,688
...because I called the hospital...

340
00:17:52,857 --> 00:17:54,767
...and they said you were
released on Monday.

341
00:17:55,193 --> 00:17:57,582
Yes, that's true...

342
00:17:57,753 --> 00:18:03,055
...but then, see, I was taken
to the Bell's Palsy Center.

343
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:05,744
In-- In Rockville.

344
00:18:05,913 --> 00:18:08,499
Absolutely first--
First-rate facility.

345
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:11,348
Top-- Top-notch physicians.

346
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,222
Hey, come on. Come on.
Get off me.

347
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:16,694
He won't hurt you. He's just playing.

348
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:18,479
Now you keep that mutt
away from me.

349
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:21,997
Mutt? I'll wager his parents
are more pure than yours.

350
00:18:23,257 --> 00:18:24,850
Kramer, are you coming?

351
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:27,700
-Oh, hi, Ellen.
-Get in here.

352
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:34,743
Listen, it's been a pleasure
taking care of your dog for a week...

353
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:36,791
...but if you don't mind....

354
00:18:36,952 --> 00:18:40,880
Prediction: You'll be calling me to ask
if you can come and visit him...

355
00:18:41,047 --> 00:18:42,738
...before the month is out.

356
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:47,212
Prediction: I never see you
or him again for the rest of my life.

357
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:54,448
We made plans.

358
00:18:54,903 --> 00:18:56,691
Why don't we just rent a movie?

359
00:18:56,855 --> 00:18:59,538
I thought you wanted to see
<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

360
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:04,656
No. It's supposed to be
really bad. Really bad.

361
00:19:04,823 --> 00:19:07,539
I mean, it's long. There's no story.

362
00:19:07,702 --> 00:19:12,045
It's so unbelievably boring--
I heard. l....

363
00:19:13,431 --> 00:19:15,373
Jerry, you promised me we'd go.

364
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:18,608
Well, George told me
the whole story, line for line.

365
00:19:18,774 --> 00:19:22,222
I almost feel like I've seen it already
and walked out on it.

366
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:26,513
Wait. George saw the movie? I saw
him yesterday. He didn't mention it.

367
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:28,818
You and George got together?

368
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:32,397
Yeah. I wanted to talk about how
we had nothing to talk about.

369
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:35,440
Hello.

370
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:36,882
Hi, hi, hi.

371
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:38,255
		

372
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:39,915
Well, you were right.

373
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:41,994
-About what?
-Ellen.

374
00:19:42,165 --> 00:19:44,718
We broke up again.

375
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:47,338
Too bad.

376
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:50,127
I thought she was the one.

377
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:53,483
I'll bring back the pot.

378
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,046
Okay, come on. It's movie time.

379
00:19:56,212 --> 00:19:58,317
-Hey, what are you gonna see?
-<i>Prognosis Negative</i>.

00:19:58,484 --> 00:20:00,175
-That's supposed to be great.
-It's not.

381
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,275
-Well, how do you know?
-I have an instinct for these things.

382
00:20:03,444 --> 00:20:06,892
I had a parakeet when I was a kid.
That was the only pet I really enjoyed.

383
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,813
We used to let him out of his cage...

384
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,435
...and he would fly around.
And my mother had built--

385
00:20:11,603 --> 00:20:14,800
One entire wall of our living room
was mirrored...

386
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,971
...she felt this gives you
a feeling of space.

387
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,311
Have you ever heard this
interior-design principle?

388
00:20:19,475 --> 00:20:21,711
The mirror makes it seem like
you have another room.

389
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,282
Who walks up
to a mirror and goes:

390
00:20:23,443 --> 00:20:26,378
''Hey, look. There's a whole
other room in there.

391
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:29,806
There's a guy in there,
looks just like me''?

392
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:34,956
But the parakeet will fall for this.
You let him out. He flies around.

393
00:20:35,123 --> 00:20:38,472
Bang! With his little head.
He would just go:

394
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:41,938
I'd always think, even if he thinks
the mirror is another room...

395
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:46,512
...why doesn't he at least try and
avoid hitting the other parakeet?
