1
00:00:04,295 --> 00:00:07,992
I'm tired of pretending I'm excited
every time it's somebody's birthday.

2
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,896
What is the big deal?
How many times do we have to...

3
00:00:11,069 --> 00:00:13,264
...celebrate that someone was born?

4
00:00:13,438 --> 00:00:17,067
Every year, over and over.
All you did was not die for 12 months.

5
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:19,971
That's all you've done,
as far as I could tell.

6
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:22,578
I love the astrology things
that tell you the people...

7
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:24,442
...that have the same birthday
as you.

8
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:26,413
It's always an odd group
of people to it.

9
00:00:26,584 --> 00:00:29,382
It's like Ed Asner,
Elijah Muhammed and Secretariat.

10
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:37,093
I don't wanna live.

11
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:39,821
I don't wanna live!

12
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:42,723
Because of me?

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,028
You must be joking. Who wouldn't
wanna live because of me?

14
00:00:46,204 --> 00:00:48,536
- I'm nothing.
- No.

15
00:00:48,706 --> 00:00:51,800
- You're something.
- You can do better than me.

16
00:00:51,976 --> 00:00:55,036
You could throw a dart out the window
and hit someone better than me.

17
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:56,578
I'm no good.

18
00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:58,978
You're good. You're good.

19
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,674
I'm bad. I'm bad.

20
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,649
You're killing me!

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,618
So what could I do?
I couldn't go through with it.

22
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,348
She threatened to kill herself.

23
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,319
Over you?

24
00:01:10,795 --> 00:01:13,025
Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?

25
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:16,262
- Well...
- I'm trying to get in touch...

26
00:01:16,434 --> 00:01:18,800
...with Sharon Leonard.
She works for the NYU paper.

27
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:22,201
This is Jerry Seinfeld. She was
supposed to meet me for an interview.

28
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,864
Oh, what are you gonna get
Jerry for his birthday?

29
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,102
- I got him a great gift.
- Really? What?

30
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:29,143
I got two tickets
to see Guys and Dolls.

31
00:01:29,313 --> 00:01:31,907
Oh, that is a good gift.

32
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,414
Maybe he'll take me.

33
00:01:34,318 --> 00:01:37,082
No, I'm gonna go with him.

34
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:38,552
What did you get him?

35
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,854
I got him a two-line phone.

36
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:42,253
Really? That's good.

37
00:01:42,427 --> 00:01:44,520
Unbelievable. She's not there.

38
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:47,893
- What paper does she write for?
- For the NYU school newspaper.

39
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,126
She's a grad student in journalism.
Never been to a comedy club.

40
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:52,963
Never seen me.
Has no idea who I am.

41
00:01:53,137 --> 00:01:55,128
Never even seen you?

42
00:01:55,306 --> 00:01:56,967
Gotta kind of envy that.

43
00:01:58,643 --> 00:02:01,806
You know, you've been developing
quite the acid tongue lately.

44
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,374
Really?

45
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,383
Who do you think is
the most unattractive world leader?

46
00:02:08,686 --> 00:02:10,620
- Living or all-time?
- All-time.

47
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,951
If it's all-time, there's no contest.
It begins and ends with Brezhnev.

48
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,950
I don't know. Did you ever
get a good look at De Gaulle?

49
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,261
Lyndon Johnson
was uglier than De Gaulle.

50
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:23,828
I got news for you. Golda Meir
could make them all run up a tree.

51
00:02:25,737 --> 00:02:27,602
Golda Meir. Good one, babe.

52
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,632
Hey, come here. Come here.

53
00:02:31,809 --> 00:02:34,869
Those two girls behind you,
they're eavesdropping.

54
00:02:35,813 --> 00:02:39,214
- Really?
- You know just because you two...

55
00:02:39,383 --> 00:02:40,975
...are homosexuals, so what?

56
00:02:43,187 --> 00:02:48,147
I mean, you should come out of
the closet and be openly gay already.

57
00:02:50,394 --> 00:02:52,259
So, what do you say?

58
00:02:54,165 --> 00:02:57,430
You know you'll always
be the only man I'll ever love.

59
00:02:57,702 --> 00:02:59,260
What's the matter with you?

60
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:02,838
- Come on. Go along.
- I'm not going along.

61
00:03:03,007 --> 00:03:06,101
I could just see you in Berlin
in 1939 goose-stepping past me.

62
00:03:06,277 --> 00:03:09,269
"Come on, Jerry.
Go along. Go along."

63
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:12,072
- You're no fun.
- You know, I hear that all the time.

64
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,480
- Hear what?
- That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.

65
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,347
Yeah, people ask me that
about you too.

66
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:20,184
Yeah, because I'm single,
I'm thin, and I'm neat.

67
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:23,554
And you get along well with women.

68
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:26,288
I guess that leaves me in the clear.

69
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,132
Hi, Jerry, it's Sharon Leonard
from the NYU paper.

70
00:03:31,302 --> 00:03:33,827
I'm here at the coffee shop,
and I was a little late.

71
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,472
We must have missed
each other.

72
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,403
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Me too.

73
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:41,636
I'll be here for a little while longer,
and I'll try to hook up with you later.

74
00:03:50,354 --> 00:03:51,946
- Hey.
- Hey.

75
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:56,651
I just thought of a great name for
myself, if I ever become a porno actor.

76
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:01,223
Oh, yeah? What? Buck Naked?

77
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:04,935
Yeah. How did you know that?

78
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,061
You told me that already.
Like two months ago.

79
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:10,574
Let me ask you something.

80
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:13,042
What do you think of this shirt?

81
00:04:13,911 --> 00:04:16,004
Well...

82
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:19,115
Allison bought it for me.

83
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:24,816
- How you gonna get out of that one?
- I don't know.

84
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:27,787
I guess I have to wait for her to die.

85
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:32,823
- Yeah?
- Sharon from N YU.

86
00:04:32,997 --> 00:04:34,225
Come on up.

87
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:37,231
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's that reporter from NYU.

88
00:04:37,401 --> 00:04:39,733
She's doing the interview.
I told her to come here...

89
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,269
...so we won't miss each other.

90
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,067
- Do you want me to stay or...?
- Sure, I don't care.

91
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:48,039
Hi.

92
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,306
Hi, I'm... I'm Sharon.

93
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:52,381
Hi, I'm Jerry.

94
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,044
- Something the matter?
- No, no. Nothing.

95
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,656
- You look familiar. Have we ever met?
- I'm not sure. Have we?

96
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:01,919
You look familiar.

97
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,493
Why don't we do this over here?
This is George.

98
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:06,892
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

99
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:10,227
- He'll hang around, if that's okay.
- Sure, I'd like to talk to him too.

100
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:12,562
Oh, really?

101
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:15,299
- Okay.
- Okay.

102
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:16,835
There we go.

103
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:22,070
- Oh, is that a problem?
- No, I just hate my voice on tape.

104
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:24,976
It always sounds so high and whiny.

105
00:05:25,917 --> 00:05:27,509
- Well, shall we start?
- Fire away.

106
00:05:27,685 --> 00:05:32,782
Okay, let's see. Are you just a
comedian, or do you do anything else?

107
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,858
Well, right now George
and I are writing a pilot for NBC.

108
00:05:36,027 --> 00:05:37,654
Oh, so you also work together.

109
00:05:38,763 --> 00:05:40,162
Yeah.

110
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:43,524
Jerry, did you wash this pear?

111
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:48,227
- Yeah, I washed it.
- It looks like it hasn't been washed.

112
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:50,736
So wash it.

113
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,434
You hear the way he talks to me?

114
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,345
You should hear
how my boyfriend talks to me.

115
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,048
What?

116
00:06:04,755 --> 00:06:07,383
Hey, let me ask you something.

117
00:06:07,558 --> 00:06:09,025
What do you think of this shirt?

118
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:10,789
It's nice.

119
00:06:11,562 --> 00:06:14,190
Jerry said he didn't like it.

120
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:16,560
I didn't say I didn't like it.
I said it was okay.

121
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:19,965
- Oh, you said you didn't like it.
- Oh, well, so what if I don't like it?

122
00:06:20,137 --> 00:06:22,571
Is that, like, the end
of the world or something?

123
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,537
So how did you two meet?

124
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:26,802
Oh, actually, we met
in a gym locker room.

125
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:28,570
Yeah.

126
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:31,772
Actually, it was in gym class.
I was trying to climb the ropes...

127
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,042
...and Jerry was spotting me.

128
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:38,312
And I kept slipping
and burning my thighs.

129
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:41,490
And then finally I slipped,
and I fell on Jerry's head.

130
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:46,162
We've been close ever since.

131
00:06:46,397 --> 00:06:47,659
Do you guys live together?

132
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:50,557
- Live together?
- No, I got my own place.

133
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:53,067
Oh, and do your parents know?

134
00:06:53,804 --> 00:06:55,897
- Know what?
- My parents?

135
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:58,098
They don't know what's going on.

136
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:02,912
You're that girl in the coffee shop
that was eavesdropping on us.

137
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,377
I knew you looked familiar.

138
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:05,879
Oh, no! No!

139
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,346
- I better get going.
- There's been a big misunderstanding.

140
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,353
We did that for your benefit.
We knew you were eavesdropping.

141
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:15,617
That's why my friend said all that.
It was on purpose. We're not gay.

142
00:07:15,793 --> 00:07:17,624
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

143
00:07:17,795 --> 00:07:20,229
- No, of course not.
- It's fine, if that's who you are.

144
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,389
- Absolutely.
- I mean, I have many gay friends.

145
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:24,898
- My father's gay.
- Look...

146
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,297
...I know what I heard.

147
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,098
- Heard. It was a joke.
- Look, you wanna have sex right now?

148
00:07:29,273 --> 00:07:32,037
Do you wanna have sex
with me right now? Let's go.

149
00:07:33,944 --> 00:07:36,879
Come on! Let's go, baby! Come on!

150
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:42,383
Hey, come on. Let's go.
I thought we were gonna take a steam.

151
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:46,288
- No, I don't want any steam.
- No. No steam.

152
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:49,187
Well, I don't wanna
sit there naked all by myself.

153
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,985
The whole thing's your fault.

154
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,924
You want me to talk to her?
I'd be perfectly willing to.

155
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:55,962
- I don't think so.
- Because you know me...

156
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:59,227
...I walk into a room,
problem solved.

157
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:02,062
She says she'll think about it.

158
00:08:02,473 --> 00:08:06,933
So what, even if it does come out.
It'll just be in an NYU paper.

159
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:09,139
Why don't you take your jacket off?

160
00:08:09,313 --> 00:08:12,305
- No, I'm okay.
- I'm gonna try her again.

161
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:14,314
Boy.

162
00:08:14,552 --> 00:08:17,282
Happy birthday. "Faruba!"

163
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:21,584
- Today's not my birthday.
- Well, I beg to differ.

164
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:24,152
Well, I think I know
when my birthday is.

165
00:08:24,328 --> 00:08:26,853
Yeah, well, you'd think so,
but you'd be wrong.

166
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:31,857
Maybe he's right.
Maybe it is my birthday.

167
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:34,530
Would you take the jacket off?

168
00:08:34,705 --> 00:08:37,606
Leave me alone. Get off
my back about the jacket.

169
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:39,868
- Oh, look at this. A phone.
- Yeah.

170
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:42,069
A two-line phone.

171
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:45,112
That's terrific! Thanks a lot.

172
00:08:45,282 --> 00:08:47,614
Now when someone's
on the phone, I can make a call.

173
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:49,946
- Yeah.
- Look, Elaine, a two-line phone.

174
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,948
Yeah, I see it.

175
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:53,613
I'm gonna get one myself.

176
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,291
Where you going?

177
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:57,450
I gotta go return something.

178
00:08:58,863 --> 00:09:00,728
I got a dial tone.

179
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:02,957
- Okay, this is the maiden call.
- Yeah.

180
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:04,965
Wait, wait. I wanna get the first call.

181
00:09:05,136 --> 00:09:07,104
All right. Go to your house.
I'll call you.

182
00:09:12,977 --> 00:09:14,808
- Hello.
- Hello.

183
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:17,709
Hey, it's working. This is great.
Thanks a lot.

184
00:09:17,882 --> 00:09:20,715
- Happy birthday, buddy.
- Wait, I got a call on the other line.

185
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:23,752
- Okay, later.
- All right, I'll talk to you later.

186
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:26,355
- Hello?
- Jerry, it's Sharon from N YU.

187
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,389
- Oh, hi.
- I was just calling to tell you...

188
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,460
...I'm not gonna play up that angle
we talked about on the story.

189
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:34,097
Oh, thank you very much.
That's great.

190
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:37,257
Hold on a second.
I got a call on the other line.

191
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:38,896
- Hello.
- Hey.

192
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:41,970
How you doing? You know I got
that reporter from the newspaper...

193
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:44,835
...on the other line.
- So, what did she say?

194
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:47,603
She said she's not gonna play up
that angle in the story.

195
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:50,338
She thinks we're heterosexual.
I guess we fooled her.

196
00:09:50,514 --> 00:09:52,709
All right, I'll get rid of her. Hold on.

197
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,440
Sharon?

198
00:09:54,952 --> 00:09:56,579
Hello?

199
00:09:57,154 --> 00:09:59,088
Sharon, are you there?

200
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,715
- I'm back.
- You know...

201
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:05,518
...I could hear you on the other line.

202
00:10:13,604 --> 00:10:15,231
What are you talking about?

203
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,807
I heard what you said:
"Sharon, are you there?"

204
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:21,536
You heard me talking
on the other line? Are you sure?

205
00:10:21,712 --> 00:10:23,043
Yes, I heard you.

206
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:24,442
Maybe she was disconnected.

207
00:10:24,615 --> 00:10:27,641
Maybe she wasn't. Maybe she heard
the whole conversation.

208
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:32,346
All right. Let me call Kramer, and see
if you can hear anything. Hold on.

209
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:36,951
- Hello.
- There may be...

210
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:38,719
...a problem with the phone.
Hold on.

211
00:10:38,896 --> 00:10:40,625
"There may be a problem
with the phone."

212
00:10:40,798 --> 00:10:42,390
Oh, no!

213
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,062
Kramer, this phone's
a piece of junk. Goodbye.

214
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:47,602
"This phone's a piece of junk."

215
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:49,898
Oh, no! She's heard everything!
What will we do?

216
00:10:50,074 --> 00:10:52,941
She thinks we're gay. Not that
there's anything wrong with it.

217
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:55,943
No, no, of course not. People's
personal sexual preferences...

218
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,944
...are nobody's business
but their own.

219
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,616
- Hi.
- Hi.

220
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:04,219
Elaine, right? Nice to meet you.

221
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:07,619
- Thanks for meeting with me.
- Sure. Would you like to take a seat?

222
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,452
- Sure.
- Thank you.

223
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,095
Why don't you take your coat off?

224
00:11:14,598 --> 00:11:17,158
So she kept insisting
I take off my coat.

225
00:11:17,434 --> 00:11:21,803
I refused, and then she forcibly
tried to get me to remove it.

226
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,167
She didn't take her coat off
in my house, either.

227
00:11:25,276 --> 00:11:28,507
You know there are tribes in Indonesia
where if you keep your coat on...

228
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,772
...in somebody's house,
the families go to war.

229
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:32,709
Give me a break.

230
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:35,510
So you don't take your coat off,
and now everyone at NYU...

231
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:38,655
...thinks I'm gay. Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

232
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:40,517
Not at all.

233
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:44,321
- Take that coat off.
- I don't want to take it off.

234
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:47,089
Take your coat off, already.

235
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:51,794
When will we see it?
I'd like to read the article.

236
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:53,493
They're sending it to me.

237
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,468
All right, well...

238
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,699
- Here you go. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

239
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,404
Two tickets to Guys and Dolls.
I'm gonna go with you.

240
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:09,117
Guys and Dolls?
Isn't that a lavish Broadway musical?

241
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:13,715
It's Guys and Dolls,
not Guys and Guys.

242
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:17,092
You're right. Guys and Dolls.
Thanks. Thanks very much.

243
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:20,492
- All right.
- All right, well...

244
00:12:20,798 --> 00:12:24,427
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, Lainey!

245
00:12:26,737 --> 00:12:30,229
The Collected Works
of Bette Midler.

246
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:37,341
What? l...
I thought you liked Bette Midler.

247
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:39,175
She's all right.

248
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:42,046
- You said you liked her.
- Well, so what? Maybe I do like her.

249
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,813
- So what?
- So nothing.

250
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:50,285
- Well, thanks for the CDs.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

251
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:56,063
Why are those two people
pointing at you over there?

252
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,158
I don't know.

253
00:13:03,173 --> 00:13:05,038
- What've you got there?
- The New York Post.

254
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:07,439
They've got an article about you.

255
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,879
"Although they maintain
separate residences...

256
00:13:11,048 --> 00:13:16,247
...the comedian and his longtime
companion seem to be inseparable."

257
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,945
Oh, no, The Associated Press
picked up the NYU story.

258
00:13:19,123 --> 00:13:20,556
That's gonna be in every paper.

259
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:23,352
I've been outed. I wasn't even in.

260
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,892
Now everyone's gonna
think we're gay.

261
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:29,726
Not that there's anything wrong
with that.

262
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,128
No, not at all.

263
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,835
"Within the confines
of his fastidious bachelor pad...

264
00:13:41,011 --> 00:13:45,141
...Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over
the cleanliness of a piece of fruit...

265
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:48,944
...like an old married couple."
I told you that pear was washed.

266
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:56,391
I thought we were friends.

267
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:02,756
Here we go.

268
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:05,424
I mean, how could you two keep this
a secret from me?

269
00:14:05,602 --> 00:14:08,662
- It's not true.
- Enough lying.

270
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,500
The lying is through.

271
00:14:10,674 --> 00:14:13,108
Come on, Jerry,
the masquerade is over.

272
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:16,337
You're thin, late 30s, single.

273
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,305
- So are you.
- Yeah.

274
00:14:30,194 --> 00:14:32,355
- Hello.
- George?

275
00:14:32,863 --> 00:14:34,490
Mrs. Seinfeld?

276
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,463
Oh, my God.

277
00:14:38,602 --> 00:14:41,332
Oh, my God. Ma?

278
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,166
- Jerry?
- Ma.

279
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,205
Oh, my God!

280
00:14:45,442 --> 00:14:47,672
My mother!

281
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,713
- Jerry.
- Ma, it's not true.

282
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:54,417
It was those culottes
you made him wear when he was 5.

283
00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:56,746
They weren't culottes.
They were shorts.

284
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,287
They were culottes! You bought
them in the girls' department.

285
00:15:00,457 --> 00:15:04,223
By mistake.
By mistake, Jerry. I'm sorry.

286
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:07,454
It looked like he was wearing a skirt,
for crying out loud.

287
00:15:07,631 --> 00:15:09,326
It has nothing to do
with the culottes.

288
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,094
Not that there's anything wrong
with that, Jerry.

289
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:18,570
I open up the paper, and this
is what I have to read about?

290
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:20,539
I fell right off the toilet.

291
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,639
My back went out again.
I couldn't move.

292
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:26,942
The super had to come
and help me up.

293
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:28,709
I was half-naked.

294
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:31,687
It's not true.

295
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:34,423
Every day it's something else
with you.

296
00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:36,616
I don't know anything
about you anymore.

297
00:15:36,793 --> 00:15:39,728
Who are you?
What kind of life are you leading?

298
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:44,558
Who knows what you're doing.
Maybe you're making porno films.

299
00:15:44,835 --> 00:15:46,166
Yeah.

300
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:47,598
I'm Buck Naked.

301
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:50,968
You're who? Buck Naked?

302
00:15:51,141 --> 00:15:55,134
Jerry, I can see.
He's so neat and thin.

303
00:15:55,312 --> 00:15:57,041
Not that there's anything
wrong with it.

304
00:15:57,214 --> 00:15:58,943
Of course not.

305
00:16:01,852 --> 00:16:05,253
Six-thirty, Scott.
Time for your sponge bath.

306
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,293
Six-thirty already? I fell asleep.

307
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:16,990
Let me help you off with that.
Here, I'll Just slip it over your head.

308
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:27,369
- The water's nice and warm, isn't it?
- Oh, that feels really good.

309
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:32,081
George, are you
telling me the truth?

310
00:16:32,983 --> 00:16:35,474
George, I'm talking to you!

311
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,621
Guess who left a message
on my machine.

312
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:45,250
That reporter from NYU.
I wonder what she wants.

313
00:16:49,232 --> 00:16:51,393
All right.
Now the play is tomorrow night.

314
00:16:51,568 --> 00:16:54,093
Would you like dinner first
or just meet at the theater?

315
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,637
Excuse me, sir,
I'm sorry to bother you.

316
00:16:56,807 --> 00:17:00,072
I want you to know that it took a lot
of guts to come out how you did...

317
00:17:00,243 --> 00:17:02,370
...and that you've inspired me
to do the same...

318
00:17:02,546 --> 00:17:05,606
...even though that may mean
a discharge from the service. Thanks.

319
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:18,088
You know, I think I'll pass
on the Guys and Dolls.

320
00:17:18,595 --> 00:17:19,823
All right, fine, don't go.

321
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:22,861
I try and go out and do something
special for your birthday...

322
00:17:23,033 --> 00:17:25,900
...and this is the thanks I get.
Everything's tainted now.

323
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:30,665
- Would you keep your voice down?
- No, I will not keep my voice down!

324
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:33,035
Nothing can make me keep
my voice down!

325
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,579
If you boys cannot
control yourselves...

326
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:40,683
...then I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

327
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,254
- Fine, I'll take Elaine.
- Yes.

328
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:55,159
Just don't say anything to Allison.

329
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:57,630
No, I won't.
Did she see the article?

330
00:17:57,801 --> 00:18:01,862
- No. Just imagine her reaction.
- Yeah.

331
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:04,400
- Oh, my God.
- What?

332
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,972
She hasn't seen the article.

333
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,869
When she sees it,
she's gonna think...

334
00:18:11,314 --> 00:18:15,080
I'm out, baby! I'm out!

335
00:18:19,656 --> 00:18:22,216
Yeah, so?

336
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,757
"Yeah, so?"

337
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:26,452
Well, this is nice.
They mention your name.

338
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,097
Don't you see what it says here?

339
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:30,256
Don't you understand
what that's implying?

340
00:18:30,434 --> 00:18:32,265
No. What?

341
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,899
I'm gay. I'm a gay man.

342
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,064
I'm very, very gay.

343
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,310
- You're gay?
- Extraordinarily gay.

344
00:18:41,478 --> 00:18:43,275
Steeped in gayness.

345
00:18:44,981 --> 00:18:46,414
I don't believe it.

346
00:18:47,284 --> 00:18:48,751
You don't believe me, ask Jerry.

347
00:18:49,286 --> 00:18:51,015
- I will.
- What do you mean, you will?

348
00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:52,678
No, no, no. That's a bad idea.

349
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:57,384
- Jerry's a very private person.
- I wanna hear it from Jerry.

350
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,967
Oh, can you ever forgive me?

351
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,397
I don't know.

352
00:19:16,913 --> 00:19:19,279
All right, I forgive you.

353
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:23,343
You know, the funny thing is,
I was attracted to you immediately.

354
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,011
I was attracted to you too.
You remind me of Lois Lane.

355
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:41,302
Jerry! Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

356
00:19:43,273 --> 00:19:44,501
What?

357
00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:46,633
You're with a woman!

358
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,140
I know. What are you doing here?

359
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:53,578
I leave you alone for two seconds,
and this is what you do?

360
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,775
I trusted you!

361
00:19:56,753 --> 00:19:58,983
- Would you get the hell out of here?
- Stop it.

362
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,454
- What...? What's going on?
- Yeah, what's going on?

363
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,956
All right. Tell her. Go ahead.

364
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:04,855
- Tell her what?
- You know, about us.

365
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,928
- Are you crazy?
- Tell her, Jerry. Tell her.

366
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:09,565
I'm telling her nothing.
Do you know what you're saying?

367
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:11,325
This... This is too weird.

368
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,197
Wait a minute. You wrote the article.
Go ahead. Tell her.

369
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:15,599
I'm out of here.

370
00:20:15,772 --> 00:20:19,208
It's not true! It's not true!

371
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:22,368
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

372
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:26,673
- You stupid idiot.
- Oh, please don't be upset.

373
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,875
Oh, would you stop it
with that stuff?

374
00:20:29,653 --> 00:20:32,144
What's going on?

375
00:20:32,322 --> 00:20:34,051
All right, I'll tell you the truth.

376
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,788
I'm not gay.

377
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,186
My name's Buck Naked.
I'm a porno actor.

378
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,470
- Really?
- Oh, my God.

379
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,972
- Hey, how you doing?
- How you doing?

380
00:20:54,244 --> 00:20:56,007
Hello.

381
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,548
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. How are you?

382
00:20:58,815 --> 00:21:01,409
All right, we'll see you later.

383
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:08,516
He's the phone man.

384
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:15,159
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

385
00:21:23,473 --> 00:21:25,134
I am not gay.

386
00:21:26,476 --> 00:21:29,639
I am, however,
thin, single and neat.

387
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:31,542
When someone is thin,
single and neat...

388
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:34,309
...people assume they're gay
because that's the stereotype.

389
00:21:34,484 --> 00:21:37,783
We normally don't think of gay people
as fat, sloppy and married.

390
00:21:38,154 --> 00:21:41,487
Although I'm sure there are, I don't
want to perpetuate the stereotype.

391
00:21:41,658 --> 00:21:44,627
I'm sure they're the minority,
though, within the gay community.

392
00:21:44,794 --> 00:21:47,820
Probably discriminated against.
Because of that, people say to them:

393
00:21:47,998 --> 00:21:50,091
"You know, Joe,
I enjoy being gay with you...

394
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:54,363
...but it's about time you got in shape,
tucked your shirt in and lost the wife."

395
00:21:55,672 --> 00:21:58,197
If people are gonna assume
that neat people are gay...

396
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:00,036
...instead of doing this:

397
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,871
"I think Joe might be a little..."

398
00:22:02,045 --> 00:22:05,173
They should vacuum.
"You know, I think Joe might be..."

399
00:22:06,216 --> 00:22:07,547
Yeah.

400
00:22:07,984 --> 00:22:11,044
I got a feeling he's a little...
