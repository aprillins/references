1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,100
So I'm on line at the supermarket.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,600
Two women in front of me.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,000
One of them, her total was $8.
The other, $3.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,700
They both, of course, choose
to pay by the use of the check.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,100
Fact is, if it is a woman in front of you
that's writing out the check...

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,800
...you'll not be waiting long.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,100
I have noticed that women
are very fast with checks.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,100
You know, because they write
out so many checks.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,100
The keys, they can never find.
They don't know where that is.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,700
But the checkbook, they got that.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,400
They never fumble
for the checkbook.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,100
The checkbook
comes out of a holster.

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
"Who do I make it out to?

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,300
There's my ID."

15
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,200
There's something about a check,
that, to a man, is not masculine.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,200
I don't know exactly what it is.
I think, to a man...

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,200
...a check is like a note
from your mother.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,100
"I don't have any money,
but if you'll contact these people...

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,500
...l'm sure they'll stick up for me. If you
could just trust me this one time.

20
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:12,100
I don't have any money,
but I have these.

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,200
I wrote on these.

22
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,300
Is this of any value at all?"

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
What's that one?

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,500
Cocoon II, The Return.

25
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,500
I guess they didn't like it up there.

26
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,700
Maybe they came back
for Chinese food.

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,700
You know, Maureen Stapleton
gets a craving...

28
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,200
...she's probably screaming
at those aliens:

29
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,300
"I gotta have a lo mein."

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,700
Okay, what are we doing here?
I have seen everything.

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,500
Oh, yeah?

32
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,600
I don't believe you've seen this.

33
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,700
- Oh, lovely.
- Yeah.

34
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,900
What do you think their parents think?

35
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,700
"So, what's your son doing now,
Dr. Stevens?"

36
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,100
"Oh, he's a public fornicator."

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,800
"Yes, he's a fine boy."

38
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,300
You know, this would be a really
funny gift for Pamela's birthday.

39
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,300
Pamela. Do I know her?

40
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,800
Yeah, you met her when
we were going out.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,200
Oh, yeah, right.

42
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,400
You have no idea who I'm
talking about, do you?

43
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,300
No.

44
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,300
Blond hair, remember? Glasses.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,300
Have you totally blocked out
the entire time we were a couple?

46
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,000
- Riverside Drive.
- Right.

47
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,400
In fact... No. Never mind.

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,800
Well, what is it?

49
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,100
A bunch of people are getting
together tomorrow at some bar...

50
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,800
...for her birthday, but...

51
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,500
You don't want to go to that.
No. Okay.

52
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,300
Wait a second. Wait a second.

53
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,400
We could work out a little deal here.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,800
- What little deal?
- I will go to that...

55
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,800
...you go with me to the little
family wedding I have on Saturday.

56
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,200
A wedding?

57
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,700
- Have you lost it, man?
- My parents are coming in for this.

58
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,500
- They're coming in?
- Yeah, tomorrow.

59
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,800
Hey, did your father
ever get that hair weave?

60
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,300
No, no.

61
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,800
Still doing the big sweep across.

62
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,100
Why does he do that?

63
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,700
Doesn't think anyone can tell.

64
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,700
So, come on, do we have a deal?

65
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,100
A wedding?

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,600
There's a lot of people to mock.

67
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,900
- All right. What the hell.
- Great.

68
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,400
When you're dead, you're dead.
That's it. You're not going anywhere.

69
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,100
- Come on, let's go.
- Was I supposed to bring something?

70
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,000
- You could have.
- I met her one time.

71
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,600
- It is not necessary.
- Then what did you say that for?

72
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,800
- Hi.
- Hi, Pamela.

73
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,200
- You remember Jerry?
- Yes, we met.

74
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,200
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

75
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,500
Everybody, this is Jerry and Elaine.

76
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,800
- Hi.
- Hi.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,200
I didn't bring anything.

78
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,600
- I put you two right here.
- Oh, okay.

79
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,200
I'm sorry. I didn't know what...
You know.

80
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,100
Nobody's told me anything
about this...

81
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,500
How big a tip you think it
would take to get him to stop?

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm in for 5.

83
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,800
I'll supply the hat.

84
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,800
What do we have here?

85
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,300
Why don't you relax,
and take your jacket off.

86
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,900
I can't. I have a tendency
to get chilly.

87
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,300
How masculine.

88
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,500
Plus I'm wearing short sleeves.
I don't want to expose my tattoos.

89
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,000
She's unbelievable.

90
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,100
- Hey, this guy says he know Bricker.
- Oh, you know Bricker? From where?

91
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,600
What's going on here?

92
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,500
Got to be her boyfriend.
She's too good to be alone.

93
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,800
What's the difference?
I can't manoeuvre anyway...

94
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,100
...with Elaine next to me.

95
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,100
- How do you know Pamela?
- Friend of a friend.

96
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,300
- And you?
- We went to law school together.

97
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,100
Oh, Jerry.

98
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,400
Oh, no. Not now.

99
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,700
I had this dream last night,
and you were in it.

100
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,100
- Really?
- Yeah.

101
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,500
Oh, God, I gotta get out of this.

102
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,300
You were you, but you weren't you.

103
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,700
- No kidding?
- Yeah.

104
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,900
Why is this happening?
Please mak e her stop.

105
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,100
I think... I think we were in my
house where I grew up...

106
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,900
...and you were standing there.
You were looking out the window.

107
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,800
This is brutal.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,300
And then you turned around,
and you had these wooden teeth.

109
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,900
How do you like that?

110
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,700
Can I turn now? Is this over?

111
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,900
No, I can't. I can't. I'm stuck.

112
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,500
Jerry, are you listening to me?

113
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,900
Yes. I heard you.

114
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,100
Elaine, what's the name of that
jewellery store you took me to that time?

115
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,600
Thank you, Pamela.

116
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
So, you're a lawyer?

117
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:51,100
Sagman, Bennett, Robbins,
Oppenheim and Taff.

118
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,500
Sagman, Bennett,
Robbins, Oppenheim and Taff.

119
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,000
Of course, they handled
my tattoo-removal lawsuit.

120
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,000
- Oh, that was you.
- Imagine.

121
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,600
Spelling "mom" with two O's.

122
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,800
That's very funny.

123
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,100
- What do you do?
- Comedian.

124
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,500
Really? That explains it.

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,200
Sagman, Bennett,
Robbins, Oppenheim and Taff.

126
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,800
You ready?

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,100
We gotta run. Happy birthday.

128
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,500
- Bye, everyone.
- Thanks for coming.

129
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,500
- Bye.
- Bye.

130
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,300
I can't believe it. I got nothing.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,500
I don't even know her name.

132
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,600
Sagman, Bennett, Robbins,
Oppenheim and Taff.

133
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,900
That wasn't so bad, really.

134
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,700
You know...

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
...you could use a little work
on your manners.

136
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,600
Why? What did I do?

137
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,900
Well, I just don't appreciate
these little courtesy responses...

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
...like I'm selling you aluminium siding.
- I was listening.

139
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,500
No. You couldn't wait to get back
to your little conversation.

140
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,400
No. You were talking
about the dream you had...

141
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,100
...where you had wooden teeth.
- No!

142
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,100
No! You had wooden teeth!

143
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,300
You had wooden teeth.
I didn't have them, you did.

144
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,900
All right, so I had wooden teeth.
So what?

145
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,600
So... So nothing. Nothing.

146
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,100
Apparently Plato...

147
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,500
...who came up with the concept
of the platonic relationship...

148
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,700
...was pretty excited about it.

149
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,300
He named it after himself. He said,
"Yeah, I got this new thing.

150
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,500
Platonic.

151
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,600
My idea, my name.
Calling it after myself.

152
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,900
What I do is...

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,700
...I go out with the girls...

154
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,100
...I talk with them...

155
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,600
...don't do anything...

156
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,400
...and go right home.

157
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,700
What do you think?

158
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,500
I think it's going to be big."

159
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,600
I bet you other guys
in history tried...

160
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,000
...getting relationships named
after them, but it didn't work.

161
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:01,000
I bet you there were guys
that tried to do it. Just went:

162
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,000
"Hi, my name's Rico.

163
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,400
Would you like to go
to bed immediately?

164
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,700
Hey, it's a 'riconic' relationship."

165
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,500
- Hey.
- There he is.

166
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,700
This is what I like. See?

167
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,000
You come home, your parents
are in your bed.

168
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,700
You know, Jerry,
we don't have to do this.

169
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,200
What are you talking about?
I love having you here.

170
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,600
- Tomorrow, we'll go to a hotel.
- Ma, will you stop?

171
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,600
No. Why should we take over
your apartment?

172
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
I don't care. I'm sleeping next door.

173
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,400
Your friend Kramer doesn't mind?

174
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,100
No. He's making a bouillabaisse.

175
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,000
So, Dad, let me ask you a question.

176
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,700
How many people work
at these big law offices?

177
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,900
- Depends on the firm.
- Yeah, but if you called...

178
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,800
...and described someone,
you think they would know who it was?

179
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,700
What's the matter, you need a lawyer?

180
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,800
I met someone. I know where she
works, but I don't know her name.

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,900
Why don't you ask
someone who was at the party?

182
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,000
No. The only one I could ask
is Elaine. I can't ask her.

183
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,700
- Why not?
- Because it's complicated.

184
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,900
There's some tension there.

185
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,800
He used to go with her.

186
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,400
- Which one is she?
- From Maryland.

187
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,400
She brought the chocolate-covered
cherries you didn't like.

188
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,700
Oh, yeah. Very alert. Warm person.

189
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,300
Oh, yeah, she's great.

190
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
So how come nothing
materialized there?

191
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,900
Well, it's a tough thing
to talk about.

192
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,300
- I don't know.
- I know what it was.

193
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,000
You don't know what it was.

194
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,600
So what was it?

195
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,700
Well, we fight a lot for some reason.

196
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,600
- Oh, well.
- Oh, well.

197
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,300
And there was a little problem
with the physical chemistry.

198
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,900
Well, I think she's
a very attractive girl.

199
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,800
She is. She absolutely is.

200
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,800
I can see if there was
a weight problem...

201
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,300
No, it's not that.

202
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,900
It wasn't all one-sided.

203
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,400
You know you can't be so particular.
Nobody's perfect.

204
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,800
- I know, I know.
- You know, Jerry...

205
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,600
...good thing I wasn't so particular.

206
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,900
Idiot.

207
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,400
- Who you looking for, Sophia Loren?
- That's got nothing to do with it.

208
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,500
How about Loni Anderson?

209
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,100
Where do you get Loni Anderson?

210
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,100
Why, what's wrong
with Loni Anderson?

211
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
I like Elaine more than
Loni Anderson.

212
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,100
What are you two talking about?

213
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,100
Look, Elaine just wasn't the one.

214
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:33,000
And this other one's the one?

215
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,200
- I don't know. Maybe.
- So ask Elaine there for the number.

216
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,100
I can't. She'll get upset.

217
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,300
I never talk about
other women with her...

218
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,200
...especially this one tonight.
- How could you still see her...

219
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,900
...if you're not interested?
- We're friends.

220
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,500
Doesn't sound like you're friends.
If you were friends...

221
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,100
...you'd ask her for the number.

222
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,800
- Do you know where this one works?
- Oh, yeah.

223
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,300
So go up to the office.

224
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,900
Up to her office?

225
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,400
Go to the building.

226
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,200
She goes out to lunch, doesn't she?

227
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:04,100
- I guess.
- So you stand in the lobby...

228
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,500
...by the elevator and wait for her
to come down for lunch.

229
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,400
You mean stake out the lobby?

230
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:14,300
Morty, that's ridiculous.
Just ask Elaine for the number.

231
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,400
He doesn't want to ask Elaine
for the number.

232
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,800
So you got him standing
by the elevator like a dope.

233
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,200
- What happens when he sees her?
- He pretends he bumped into her.

234
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,100
You know what?
This is not that bad an idea.

235
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,700
- What does she look like?
- I don't know. It's hard to say.

236
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,900
What actress does she
remind you of?

237
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,700
Loni Anderson.

238
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,700
Loni Anderson?

239
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,700
What, there's something wrong
with Loni Anderson?

240
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,200
Hey, listen, thanks again
for running over here.

241
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,100
Yeah, sure. I was showing
a condo on 48th Street.

242
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,700
Besides, you think
I want to miss this?

243
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,400
- I'm a little nervous.
- Yeah. Me too.

244
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,900
If I see her, what do I say
I'm doing in the building?

245
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,900
To see me. I work in the building.

246
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,800
What do you do?

247
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,500
I'm an architect.

248
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,700
You're an architect?

249
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,900
I'm not?

250
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,100
I don't see architecture
coming from you.

251
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,200
I suppose you could be an architect.

252
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,600
I never said that I was the architect.

253
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,200
- Just something else.
- She's not even going to ask.

254
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,100
If we see her, which is remote.

255
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,300
What do you want me to say,
I just wandered in?

256
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,100
We're having lunch with a friend.
He works here.

257
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,300
What is his name?

258
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,400
Burt Har...

259
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,000
...binson. Burt Harbinson.

260
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,900
- Burt Harbinson.
- Right.

261
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:58,800
- It sounds made-up.
- No good?

262
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
All right.

263
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,900
Art...

264
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,100
...Core.

265
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,100
Art Core.

266
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,500
Velay.

267
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,300
- Corevelay?
- Yeah, right.

268
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,200
Well, what does he do?

269
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,100
He's an importer.

270
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,100
Just imports? No exports?

271
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,400
He's an importer-exporter, okay?

272
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,600
Did Elaine ever call you back?

273
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,300
No. I guess she's still mad.

274
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,200
I don't understand. You never talk
to her about other women?

275
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,700
Never.

276
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,300
Wait a second. That's her.

277
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,000
On the right.

278
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,800
I forgot who I am. Who am I?

279
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
You're you. We're having lunch
with Art Corevelay.

280
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,100
- Vandalay.
- Corevelay.

281
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,800
Let me be the architect.
I can do it. I can do it.

282
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,300
Hey, hey...

283
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,000
Pamela's birthday party.

284
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,700
- Didn't I see you there? Jerry.
- Sure. Hi.

285
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,100
- This is George. I'm sorry.
- Vanessa.

286
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,800
Nice to meet you.

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,400
Sagman, Bennett, Robbins,
Oppenheim and Taff.

288
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,800
That's right. What are you doing here?

289
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,800
Meeting a friend for lunch.
Works in the building.

290
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,500
Yeah, Art Vandalay.

291
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,100
Oh, really?

292
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,400
Which company?

293
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,700
- I don't know. He's an importer.
- I don't really know...

294
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,700
- Importer.
- And exporter.

295
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,500
He's an importer-exporter.

296
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,300
I'm...

297
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,600
I'm an architect.

298
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,000
Really? Well, what do you design?

299
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,800
Railroads.

300
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,300
I thought engineers do that.

301
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,900
They can.

302
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,400
I'm sorry you had to leave
so early the other night.

303
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,200
Me too. My cousin
had to go back to Boston.

304
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,900
- Oh, that guy was your cousin.
- Yeah.

305
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,800
- And that woman was your...
- Friend.

306
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,800
I'll just get a paper.

307
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,800
So...

308
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,900
...do you date immature men?

309
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,100
Almost exclusively.

310
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,000
I have no letters.

311
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,700
Ma, will you go already?

312
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,800
- What are you doing?
- I just want to see something.

313
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,700
You can't look in there.
We're playing.

314
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

315
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,100
- Good evening, Mr. Kramer.
- Hey, Morty.

316
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,900
- Salad dressing?
- Look.

317
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,000
- "Quo." Is that a word?
- Maybe.

318
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,500
- Will you challenge it?
- Ma, you can't look up words...

319
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,900
...in the dictionary.
Dad, she's cheating.

320
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,900
"Quo"? That's not a word.

321
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,400
- You're such a stickler.
- Well, put something down.

322
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,000
You're taking 20 minutes on this.

323
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,000
So Uncle Mac and Artie, they're all
coming here before the wedding?

324
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
They'll be here at 2:00.

325
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,700
Oh, Elaine called. She said she'd
be here at 2:30 and she says:

326
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,500
"Hope your meeting went well
with Art Vandalay."

327
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,200
- She said what?
- Just what I said. Here.

328
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,500
She knows.

329
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,300
Oh, I am such a jackass.

330
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,500
- She knows what?
- She knows the whole stupid thing.

331
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,500
Vanessa and the elevator.

332
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,800
No, no, that won't do.
He may have a Z.

333
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,600
So how did she find out?

334
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,100
Because Vanessa
probably told Pamela...

335
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,900
...and Pamela probably told Elaine.

336
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,800
So, what are you, afraid of her?

337
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,400
Yes. Yes, I am.

338
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,400
- What else did she say on the phone?
- Whatever I wrote down.

339
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,400
Yeah, but what was the tone
in her voice? How did she sound?

340
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,600
Who am I, Rich Little?

341
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,800
Well, she can't be too mad.

342
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,900
- She's still coming to the wedding.
- Yeah, but now I'm nervous.

343
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Oh, stop it.

344
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,900
- "Quone"?
- Thirty, 31, 32...

345
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,500
"Quone"?

346
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,300
No, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to challenge that.

347
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,700
No, you don't have to
challenge that. That's a word.

348
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,100
- That's a definite word.
- I am challenging.

349
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,600
"Quone." To "quone" something.

350
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,500
I'm not playing with you anymore.

351
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,100
"Quone's" not a word.

352
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,400
No good. Sorry. There it is.

353
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,200
Get it off.

354
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,400
Why did you make me put that down?

355
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,300
No. We need a medical dictionary.

356
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Like a patient gets difficult,
you quone him.

357
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,500
You want some funny material? You
ought to come down to where I work.

358
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,500
There's a sitcom.

359
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,800
You must have quite
a time down there.

360
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,600
- We got plenty of time.
- Sorry. I am just waiting for someone.

361
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,300
Watch what you say to this guy.
He'll put it in his next act.

362
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,700
- Yeah, yeah.
- Jerry, did I tell you...

363
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,100
...that I'm writing a book,
an autobiography?

364
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,700
Yeah, you mentioned it.

365
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,500
It's based on all my experiences.

366
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,800
That's perfect.

367
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,700
- Could you excuse me one second?
- Sure.

368
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,500
- I'm sorry.
- Sure.

369
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,500
How do you do? Jerry Seinfeld.

370
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,200
Oh, how do you do? Elaine Benes.

371
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,500
You want to do this now,
or you wanna wait?

372
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,100
Oh, no, let's do it now.

373
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
The whole elevator business,
let me just explain.

374
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,600
- Okay.
- Jerry, are you going with us?

375
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,900
- No, I'm gonna take my car.
- That's why I brought the wagon.

376
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,500
Why the hell
did I bring the wagon?

377
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,100
Anyway, you know
why I didn't ask you?

378
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,200
I mean, I felt so uncomfortable,
and you were so annoyed in the cab.

379
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,100
Well, Jerry, I never saw you
flirt with anyone before.

380
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,400
It was quite the spectacle.

381
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,200
Jerry, we'll see you there.
Bye, Elaine.

382
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,300
Oh, bye. Good to see you.

383
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,900
Oh, we didn't meet.

384
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,300
Sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin,
Artie Levine.

385
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,300
- Levine.
- Artie.

386
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,000
Artie! Come on.

387
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,600
Yeah, Levine.

388
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,600
And I'm Jerry Cougar Mellencamp.

389
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,700
Anyway, I admit it was a fairly
ridiculous thing to do...

390
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,100
...but I mean, obviously
we have a little problem here.

391
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,500
Yeah, obviously.

392
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,100
If we're gonna be friends, we gotta
be able to talk about other people.

393
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,200
- Couldn't agree more.
- Good.

394
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,100
- Good.
- Good.

395
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Great.

396
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,800
Great? Where do you get great?

397
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,200
It's great to talk about...

398
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,100
...other people.
- Guys.

399
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,600
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

400
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,300
Well, anybody specific?

401
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,000
No.

402
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,300
- A general guy.
- Oh, really?

403
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,100
- Elaine Marie Benes.
- What?

404
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,900
No, it's not a big deal.

405
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,700
No, that's great. That's terrific.

406
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,500
- No, we just met.
- Doesn't matter.

407
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,100
What's the young man's name?
I would like to meet him.

408
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,600
I don't think so.

409
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,900
Well, what does he do?
Is he an artisan...

410
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,900
...a craftsman,
a labourer of some sort?

411
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,000
- Wall Street.
- High finance.

412
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,500
Bulls, bears,
people from Connecticut.

413
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,000
And he happens to be
pretty good-looking.

414
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,800
All right, sir.

415
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,400
And he's hilarious.

416
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,700
- Now that's not fair.
- You know.

417
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,500
So where did you meet this guy?

418
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,500
I staked out his health club.

419
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,500
When you're on a stakeout...

420
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,500
...do you find it's better
to stand up against the wall...

421
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,700
...or kind of crouch down
behind a big plant?

422
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,100
You know, I think that...

423
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,500
...even if you've had
a relationship with someone...

424
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,700
...or, let's say, especially if you've had
a relationship with someone...

425
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,400
...and you try and become
friends afterwards...

426
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,100
...it's very difficult. Isn't this?

427
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,000
It's hard because you
know each other so well.

428
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,000
You know? You know all
each other's tricks.

429
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,500
It's like two magicians trying
to entertain each other.

430
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,100
You know, one goes, "Look, a rabbit."
The other goes, "So?"

431
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,800
"I believe that's your card."

432
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,500
"Look, why don't we just saw each
other in half and call it a night, okay?"

433
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,100
