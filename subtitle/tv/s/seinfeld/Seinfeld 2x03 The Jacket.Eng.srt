1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,436
I hate clothes, okay?

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:05,919
I hate buying them.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,036
I hate picking them out of my closet.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,637
I can't stand every day trying to come
up with little outfits for myself.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,949
I think eventually...

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,629
...fashion won't even exist.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,472
We'll all be wearing the same thing.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,279
Because any time I see a movie
or a TV show...

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,829
...where there's people
from the future...

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,752
...they're all wearing the same thing.

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,230
Somehow they decided,
"This is going to be our outfit."

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,916
One-piece silver jumpsuit,
V-stripe and boots. That's it.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,234
We should come up with an outfit
for Earth. An Earth outfit.

14
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,549
We should vote on it.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,951
Candidates propose
different outfits. No speeches.

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,032
They walk out, twirl, walk off.

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,398
We just sit in the audience and go,
"That was nice. I could wear that."

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,993
- I think I've seen enough.
- I might have something in the back.

19
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,120
The back? They never find
anything in the back.

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,589
If they had anything good,
they'd put it in the front.

21
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,072
Why don't they open an entire store
for the back? Call it "Just Back."

22
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,152
All back. No front.

23
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,118
You walk in the front,
you're immediately in the back.

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,913
Look, Elaine. Tie carwash.

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,269
- I just read that. That's terrific.
- Her father wrote that.

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,670
- Alton Benes is your father?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,592
I always felt he deserved
a wider audience.

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,352
I'm not so sure he wants one.

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,119
Hey, don't forget Sunday, okay?

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,158
You and George are coming, right?
Hotel Westbury, 8:00.

31
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,436
Yeah, I guess I'm coming. I mean...

32
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,837
- What, you don't wanna go now?
- No, I'll go. I'm going.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,718
No, Jerry, you have to.
I need a buffer.

34
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,314
I haven't seen my father
in a while, and, you know, it's...

35
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,792
I'm worried I won't be able talk to him.
He's such a great writer.

36
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,838
Frankly, I prefer
the company of nitwits.

37
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,075
So that's why
we're not together anymore.

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,839
What is this?

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,672
This is beautiful.

40
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,512
These jackets never fit me right.

41
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,119
Try it on.

42
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,869
Wow.

43
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,439
This is soft suede.

44
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:25,071
This may be the most perfect jacket
I have ever put on.

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,074
- How much is it?
- Oh, my God.

46
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,639
Bad?

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,870
- Very bad?
- You have no idea.

48
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,678
- I have some idea.
- No idea.

49
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,910
- I've got a ballpark.
- There's no park...

50
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,593
...and the team has relocated.

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,910
Let me see that.

52
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,198
That is high.

53
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,108
Oh, man, that is
a beautiful jacket, though.

54
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,155
What's with the pink lining
with the candy stripes?

55
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,556
It's just lining.
You can always have it changed.

56
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,392
Should I get it?

57
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,558
I hate these moments. I'm hearing
the dual voices now, you know?

58
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,633
"What about the money?"
"What's money?"

59
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,916
It looks wonderful on you.

60
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,754
- Hey.
- Hey.

61
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,508
New jacket.

62
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,398
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

63
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,278
- Is it me?
- That's definitely you.

64
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,793
- Really?
- That's more you...

65
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,712
...than you've ever been.

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,431
- What is with the pink lining?
- I don't know. It's got a pink lining.

67
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,399
- So, what'd you pay for this?
- I paid what it costs.

68
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,993
- How much?
- What's the difference?

69
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,515
- You're not gonna tell me?
- I'd rather not say out loud.

70
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,908
It's embarrassing.

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,630
- Over 300?
- Yes. But let's just stop it right there.

72
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,030
- It's over 400.
- I'm really not answering anymore.

73
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,792
- Is it over 400?
- Would you...?

74
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,596
Whoa, Nelson.

75
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,509
I know. I know.

76
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,080
What are you gonna do
with the leather one?

77
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,033
I don't know.

78
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,556
Are you gonna wear it?

79
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,879
- I don't know, maybe.
- Well, you're not gonna wear this.

80
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,430
Do you want it?

81
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,270
Yeah, okay, I'll take it.

82
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,551
I like that jacket.

83
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,274
- Okay, take it.
- Hey. Good karma for you.

84
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,750
Oh, baby.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,149
What is that song?

86
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,795
It's from Les Misérables.
I went to see it last week.

87
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,475
I can't get it out of my head.
I just keep singing it over and over.

88
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,870
It just comes out.
I have no control over it.

89
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,952
I'm singing it on elevators, buses.
Singing in front of clients.

90
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,156
It's taking over my life.

91
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,158
You know, Schumann
went mad from that.

92
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,949
Artie Schumann
from Camp Hatchapee?

93
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,550
- No, you idiot.
- What are you, Bud Abbott?

94
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,711
What are you calling me an idiot for?

95
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,914
You don't know Robert Schumann,
the composer?

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,349
Oh, Schumann. Of course.

97
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,518
He went crazy from one note.
Couldn't get it out of his head.

98
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,229
I think it was an A. He kept
repeating it over and over again.

99
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,311
He had to be institutionalised.

100
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,913
Really?

101
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,391
Well, what if it doesn't stop?

102
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,349
Oh, that I really needed to hear.
That helps a lot.

103
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,798
All right, just say something.
Just start talking. Change the subject.

104
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,871
Let's just go, all right?

105
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,475
I can't believe we're having dinner
with Alton Benes.

106
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,153
I know exactly what's gonna happen.

107
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,356
I'm gonna try and act
like I'm not impressed.

108
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,715
- He'll see right through it.
- He'll look at us...

109
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,075
...like he's backstage
at a puppet show.

110
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,276
Let me just get my jacket.

111
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,071
This is huge.

112
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,277
- When did this happen?
- Wednesday.

113
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,357
This jacket has completely
changed my life.

114
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,398
When I leave the house in this...

115
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,517
...it's with a whole different confidence.

116
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,831
Like, tonight I might've been
a little nervous, but inside this jacket...

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,312
...I am composed, grounded, secure
that I can meet any social challenge.

118
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,479
Can I say one thing to you?

119
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,996
And I say this with an unblemished
record of staunch heterosexuality.

120
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,752
Absolutely.

121
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,598
It's fabulous.

122
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,834
- I know.
- And I'll tell you something else...

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,797
...l'm not even gonna ask you.

124
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,552
I wanna know,
but I'm not gonna ask.

125
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,280
You'll tell me
when you feel comfortable.

126
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,432
So, what was it, 400?

127
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,749
Five hundred?
Did you pay 500 for this?

128
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,040
Over 6? Can't be 7. Don't tell me
you paid $7 00 for this jacket.

129
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,078
Did you pay $7 00 for this jacket?
Is that what you're saying to me?

130
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,755
You are sick! Is that what
you paid for this jacket?

131
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,273
Over 7 00?!

132
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,269
What did you pay for this jacket?
I won't say anything.

133
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,352
I wanna know what you paid
for this jacket.

134
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,911
Oh, my God! A thousand dollars?!
You paid $1 000 for this jacket.

135
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,036
All right. I'm walking out
of here right now...

136
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,191
...thinking you paid $1 000
for this jacket...

137
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,191
...unless you tell me different.

138
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,912
All right, I'll tell you what.

139
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,993
If you don't say anything in five
seconds, I'll know it was over 1 000.

140
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,632
Hey. Hey, will you do me a solid?

141
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,268
- What kind of solid?
- Sit in the car for two minutes...

142
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,908
...while it's double-parked.
I gotta pick up some birds.

143
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,957
- Birds?
- A friend of mine, he's a magician.

144
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,714
He's away on vacation. He asked me
to take care of his doves.

145
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,917
- So take a cab.
- They won't take a cage full of birds.

146
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,120
I can't. I'm on my way out.
There's no way I can do it.

147
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,751
- George, do me a solid. Two minutes.
- Well, I'm going with him.

148
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,037
I'd like to. I've never done
a solid before.

149
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,952
All right. I'll... Yeah. All right.
Have a good one.

150
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,318
Two minutes. Believe me,
I know his two minutes.

151
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,758
By his conception of time,
his life will last over 2000 years.

152
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,438
Schumann.

153
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,432
Where are they?

154
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,431
Maybe he didn't show up.

155
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,716
What, you don't wanna do this?

156
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,871
There's never been
an appointment in my life...

157
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,917
...where I wanted the other guy
to show up.

158
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,793
Wait a second. Is that him?

159
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,031
Yeah. I think it is.

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,513
Where's Elaine?

161
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,191
I'm nervous.

162
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,476
- Excuse me, Mr. Benes.
- Yeah.

163
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,029
I'm Jerry, Elaine's friend.
This is George.

164
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,918
It's a great thrill to meet you, sir.

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,558
Sit down.

166
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,430
- Want a drink?
- Sure.

167
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,078
- What'll you have?
- Cranberry juice with two limes.

168
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,549
And I'll have a club soda with no ice.

169
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,513
I'll have another scotch
with plenty of ice.

170
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,719
You like ice.

171
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,397
- I say, do you like ice?
- Like it?

172
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,518
Don't you find that you get more
without it?

173
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,552
- Where's Elaine?
- Well, we thought...

174
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,312
...she was meeting you earlier.

175
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,710
She's usually pretty punctual.

176
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,158
Don't you find that, George?

177
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,154
Yeah. Yeah, she's punctual, and...

178
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,880
...she's been late sometimes.

179
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,077
Yeah, yeah.
Sometimes she's on time...

180
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,798
...and sometimes she's late.

181
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,198
I guess...

182
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,992
...today she's late.

183
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,158
It appears that way.

184
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,638
- Yep.
- Yep.

185
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,037
- Looks like rain.
- I know. I know. That's what they said.

186
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,476
- Who said?
- The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.

187
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't need anybody to tell me
it's gonna rain.

188
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,555
Oh, no. Of course not. L...

189
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,473
All I have to do is stick my head
out the window.

190
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,516
Which one's supposed to be
the funny guy?

191
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,638
- Oh, he's the comedian.
- I'm just a regular person.

192
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,519
No, no. He's just being modest.

193
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,474
We had a funny guy
with us in Korea.

194
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,278
A tail gunner.

195
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,438
They blew his brains out
all over the Pacific.

196
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,790
There's nothing funny about that.

197
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,594
Would you excuse me?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

198
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,239
I'll be right back.

199
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,918
I just wanted to tell you
that I really enjoyed Fair Game.

200
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,752
I thought it was just brilliant.

201
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,718
Drivel.

202
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,954
Yeah, maybe some parts.

203
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,633
What parts?

204
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,832
The...

205
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,152
...drivel parts.

206
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,636
Oh, my gosh. I just realized
I have to make a phone call.

207
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,715
I can't believe... Would you...?
I'll be right back.

208
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,393
Thank you for leaving me alone
with him.

209
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,028
That was brutal.
I can't go back out there.

210
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,714
- Well, let's just leave.
- Elaine will kill me.

211
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,235
- Where is she?
- She's gotta be here soon.

212
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,550
How could she leave us alone
with this lunatic?

213
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,599
Ten more minutes, and that's it,
I'm leaving.

214
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,671
I have to tell you,
this guy scares me.

215
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,677
The waiter was trembling.

216
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,149
We can't possibly have dinner
with him alone.

217
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,709
- How we gonna get out of it?
- We say we're frightened...

218
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,677
...and we have to go home.

219
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,996
Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk
our heads together like Moe.

220
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,273
I don't know. Just start scratching.

221
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,159
Tell him you have the crabs.
He was in the military.

222
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,117
He'll understand that.

223
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,514
All fathers are intimidating.

224
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:33,240
They're intimidating
because they are fathers.

225
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,712
Once a man has children,
for the rest of his life his attitude is:

226
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,190
"The hell with the world,
I can make my own people.

227
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,549
I'll eat whatever I want.
I'll wear whatever I want...

228
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,349
...and I'll create whoever I want."

229
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,832
Who'd you call?

230
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,232
My uncle is having an operation.
I just wanted to see how he was.

231
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,156
What kind of an operation?

232
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,072
Bone marrow.

233
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,593
- Mr. Benes?
- Yeah.

234
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,512
Message for you.

235
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,678
From Elaine.

236
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,398
She got tied up.

237
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,835
She'll be here in 30 minutes.

238
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,188
Yeah, they should have taken care
of Castro when they had the chance.

239
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,432
Like we did in Guatemala in '53.

240
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,793
- Well, Guatemala...
- Sure. Guatemala.

241
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,993
All right. You boys
get yourselves together.

242
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,438
We'll head up to the restaurant.
I'll leave a note for Elaine.

243
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,510
I'm going to the bathroom.

244
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,953
- Let's go.
- What about Elaine?

245
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,872
- Hell with Elaine.
- She'll be furious.

246
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,758
We're dying here!

247
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,838
That's her. She's here.

248
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,397
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
Where is Dad?

249
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,710
He's in the bathroom.

250
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,912
Where have you been?

251
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,395
Kramer. That Kramer.

252
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,551
I'm just about to leave,
he calls me up.

253
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,870
He begs me to sit in his car
for two minutes...

254
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,997
...so he can pick up these birds.

255
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,354
Oh, you didn't.

256
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,750
Well, he said he'd drive me here
right after.

257
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,753
So I am sitting in his car
for 20 minutes!

258
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,480
He doesn't come down.
I am freezing.

259
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,598
Then a cop comes by.
Tells me to get out of the car.

260
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,273
He's a city marshal.

261
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,271
He's towing the car away.

262
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,716
Kramer owes thousands of dollars
in back tickets.

263
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,356
He was gonna tow it
with me in the car.

264
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,273
So they tow the car.
Now I am standing outside...

265
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,477
...and I am freezing, but I cannot leave
because I gotta tell him...

266
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,834
...what happened to the car.

267
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,073
So finally, finally, he comes down
with this giant cage filled with doves.

268
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,550
He said he was getting instructions,
that each dove has a different diet.

269
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,075
So we're wandering around,
trying to get a cab...

270
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,390
...when two of these doves fly out.

271
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,232
Now we're running after these doves.

272
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,436
I almost got hit by a bus.

273
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,158
So how is everything going
over here?

274
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,235
- Great.
- Couldn't be better.

275
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,393
Good, because Dad can make
some people a little uncomfortable.

276
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,154
- Oh, no.
- Get out of here.

277
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,314
Man, Kramer. I could kill him.

278
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,835
You know better than
to get involved with Kramer.

279
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,072
- He said he'd give me a lift.
- The lift.

280
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,028
Like the lure of the Siren's song.
Never what it seems to be.

281
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,668
Yet who among us can resist?

282
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,230
Where do you come up
with this stuff?

283
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,595
- Well, look who's here.
- Oh, hi, Dad.

284
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,909
Hello, dear.

285
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,674
- Who's the lipstick for?
- No one.

286
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,592
- How's your mother?
- Fine.

287
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,031
How about you, are you working?

288
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,668
Yeah. I'm reading manuscripts
for Pendant Publishing.

289
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,273
I told you 1 0 times.

290
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,000
Pendant? Those bastards.

291
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,674
Well, all right, boys.

292
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,953
We'll go to that Pakistani
restaurant on 46th Street.

293
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,476
You're not afraid of a little spice,
are you?

294
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,915
Pipe down, chorus boy.

295
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,154
Chorus boy?

296
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,631
It's snowing.

297
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,074
It's beautiful.

298
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,919
Snow?

299
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,071
Snow, that can't be good for suede,
can it?

300
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,353
I wouldn't think so.

301
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,192
What should I do?

302
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,316
We're taking a cab, aren't we?

303
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,948
Cab? It's only five blocks.

304
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,636
- Why don't you turn it inside out?
- Inside out. Great.

305
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,678
Wait a minute.

306
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,755
- What the hell do you call this?
- I turned my jacket inside out.

307
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,998
Well, you look like a damn fool.

308
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,159
Well, it's a new suede jacket.

309
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,514
It might get ruined.

310
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,270
Well, you're not walking with me
and my daughter dressed like that.

311
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,510
That's for damn sure.

312
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,677
It's... It's only a few blocks.

313
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,228
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

314
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,799
Come on up.

315
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,148
- Hey.
- Hey.

316
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,231
- I gotta feed the birds.
- So?

317
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,630
You got any of those Mini Ritzes?

318
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,391
I can't believe that I do.

319
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,593
- What, are you going out?
- Yeah.

320
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,111
Hey, where's your new jacket?

321
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,631
- Oh, what'd you do to it?
- I was out in the snow last night.

322
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,909
Don't you know
what that does to suede?

323
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,474
I have an idea.

324
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,631
We can make the 9:30
at Cinema Three.

325
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,233
Okay.

326
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,992
Hello.

327
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,513
Thanks again for coming last night.
Dad said he had a great time.

328
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,877
- Is he still in town?
- He's driving back to Maryland tonight.

329
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,429
So, what are you gonna do
with that one now?

330
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,398
- I don't know.
- Well...

331
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,030
I didn't wanna tell you this,
but usually he hates everyone.

332
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,633
Really?

333
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,958
- You gonna throw this out?
- Well, I can't wear it.

334
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,951
Yeah, he liked you, though.

335
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,873
Said you reminded him
of somebody he knew in Korea.

336
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,230
Well, if you're just gonna throw it out,
you know, I could take it.

337
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,231
Yeah. Go ahead. Take it.

338
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,715
Dad thinks George is gay.

339
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,152
Oh, because of all the singing?

340
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,674
No. He pretty much thinks
everyone is gay.

341
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,074
See, I like it like this.

342
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,272
Isn't that...?

343
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,753
Is this from the snow last night?

344
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,515
You know what you should have done?
You should have turned it inside out.

345
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,995
I'll try and remember that.

346
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,358
Boy, it's too bad
you gave me this one too.

347
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,397
Yeah. Too bad.

348
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,719
Gonna have to do something
about this lining.

349
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,598
I had a leather jacket that got ruined.
Now, why does moisture ruin leather?

350
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,113
I don't get this.

351
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,875
Aren't cows outside
most of the time?

352
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,077
I don't understand. When it's raining,
do cows go up to the farmhouse:

353
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,834
" Let us in. We're all wearing leather!

354
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,955
Open the door. We're gonna
ruin the whole outfit here."

355
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,111
" Is it suede?"
" I am suede.

356
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,512
The whole thing is suede. I can't
have this cleaned. It's all I got."

357
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,591
