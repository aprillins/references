1
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:03,498
Do you think...

2
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,948
...that the security guards
in art museums...

3
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:10,057
...really ever stop anybody
from taking the paintings?

4
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:13,778
I mean, are they going, " Hey, where
do you think you're going with that?

5
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:16,732
Come over here.
Give me that CÃ©zanne."

6
00:00:16,893 --> 00:00:19,533
I mean, look at the job
that this man is hired to do.

7
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:21,907
He's getting $5 an hour to protect...

8
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:25,552
...millions of dollars
of priceless art, with what?

9
00:00:25,716 --> 00:00:28,323
He's got a light mocha
brown uniform...

10
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:31,118
...and a USA Today.
This is what he's got.

11
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:34,993
Crooks must look at this guy and go,
"We get past the folding chair...

12
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:37,443
...and the thermos of coffee,
we can get a Rembrandt."

13
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,918
Kramer, would you hold still?
I can't do this if you keep moving.

14
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:53,174
You sure you don't want me
to take my clothes off?

15
00:00:53,642 --> 00:00:54,863
Because I'll do it.

16
00:00:55,943 --> 00:00:58,398
No, that's the last thing
in the world I want you to do.

17
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:00,998
Well, why don't you take
your clothes off?

18
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:04,148
I don't know, I don't think
Jerry would like that.

19
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:06,138
Well, it'll be our little secret.

20
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,281
God!

21
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:15,736
Button fly!

22
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,029
Why do they put buttons on a fly?

23
00:01:18,192 --> 00:01:20,680
It takes 10 minutes
to get these things open.

24
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:23,099
I like the button fly.

25
00:01:23,256 --> 00:01:25,394
- What?
- That is one place on my wardrobe...

26
00:01:25,557 --> 00:01:28,623
...I do not need sharp,
interlocking metal teeth.

27
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,224
It's like a mink trap down there.

28
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:33,681
I'm gonna develop kidney problems.

29
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:36,143
- What are you doing today?
- Nothing.

30
00:01:36,298 --> 00:01:39,472
I have to go meet Nina. Want to come
up to her loft, check out her paintings?

31
00:01:39,635 --> 00:01:42,275
- I don't get art.
- There's nothing to get.

32
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,962
It always has to be explained to me...

33
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:46,731
...and then I have to have someone
explain the explanation.

34
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:51,056
She does abstract stuff. In fact,
she's painting Kramer right now.

35
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:54,089
- What for?
- She sees something in him.

36
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,706
So do I, but I wouldn't
hang it on a wall.

37
00:01:58,547 --> 00:01:59,998
Are you getting the eyes?

38
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:01,687
Because they're brown.

39
00:02:01,846 --> 00:02:05,523
Really, they're dark brown,
like rich Colombian coffee.

40
00:02:07,983 --> 00:02:09,281
Tell me about Elaine.

41
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:11,585
You know, she and Jerry
were a big thing...

42
00:02:11,743 --> 00:02:13,543
...like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.

43
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:18,108
- But they're still friends.
- Yeah, yeah. They're like this:

44
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:22,245
- Don't you think that's strange?
- Why? What's the difference?

45
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:26,013
Are you still friends with any
of your ex-girlfriends?

46
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:28,615
Well, you know, I...

47
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,879
I have many relationships.

48
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:35,329
- I tell you, I'm a little nervous.
- Why?

49
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:38,247
You know, the friend meeting
the new woman.

50
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:41,195
I feel like I'm getting fixed up
for a friendship.

51
00:02:41,855 --> 00:02:43,655
I don't know how long
this is gonna last.

52
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:45,950
Really?
I thought you liked her.

53
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:47,984
I do, but she's got,
like, a jealousy thing.

54
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:50,405
She doesn't like me having
fun with anyone but her.

55
00:02:50,716 --> 00:02:52,898
You know, it's a miracle
you're not married.

56
00:02:58,082 --> 00:03:00,569
Hey, I'm not obligated
to buy anything, am I?

57
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:02,791
- Hi, Nina.
- Hi.

58
00:03:02,953 --> 00:03:04,372
- This is my friend George.
- Hello.

59
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:06,359
Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

60
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:08,168
Hey, look at this guy!

61
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,495
I brought George up to see
some of your paintings.

62
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:14,414
Oh, are you interested?

63
00:03:17,722 --> 00:03:19,249
Yeah, sure.
Sure, I'm interested.

64
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,591
George, you gonna buy a painting?

65
00:03:22,172 --> 00:03:23,698
Yeah, sure.

66
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:27,689
- Are you an art lover?
- I am an art adorer. I adore art.

67
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:31,528
Great. Take a look around.
Pick something out you like.

68
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:34,753
May I?

69
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:37,545
Get out of here.

70
00:03:38,244 --> 00:03:39,389
Here. Play with this.

71
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:41,807
- What's this?
- My father gave me four tickets...

72
00:03:41,965 --> 00:03:44,224
...to the Yankee game
for Saturday afternoon.

73
00:03:44,382 --> 00:03:46,990
Owner's box, first row,
behind the dugout.

74
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:49,791
Saturday! I'm working.
I'm going out of town.

75
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:52,741
Well, I won't go without you.
You guys want them?

76
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:54,272
Yeah.

77
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:56,887
They're right behind the dugout,
George. First row.

78
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:59,648
Behind the dugout? Are you kid...?
How did you get them?

79
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:02,977
My father's the Yankees' accountant.
It's the owner's box.

80
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,664
All my life I've dreamed of sitting
front row, behind the dugout.

81
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:09,619
You like that one?

82
00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:14,406
Look at where we are!

83
00:04:14,571 --> 00:04:17,746
He's not stopping. He keeps
going and going and going.

84
00:04:18,753 --> 00:04:19,898
We're not in the first row?

85
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:23,734
- No, no. These are your seats.
- She said first row behind the dugout.

86
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:25,496
It's the second row. It's just as good.

87
00:04:25,657 --> 00:04:28,723
I was primed for the first row. I was
gonna put my feet on the dugout.

88
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,869
Shut up. These are great.
You can't get any better than this.

89
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:33,978
There's better. Right there.
That's better.

90
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:35,280
All right.

91
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:36,896
Oh, boy.

92
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,505
- All right. Who wants a dog?
- Yeah. Here you go.

93
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:41,220
What a great day.

94
00:04:41,385 --> 00:04:43,840
I could've been at my boss'
son's bris right now.

95
00:04:44,109 --> 00:04:45,527
That what you were
supposed to do?

96
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:46,826
Yeah.

97
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:49,669
What makes him think anyone wants
to witness a circumcision?

98
00:04:49,824 --> 00:04:51,700
I'd rather go to a hanging.

99
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:54,465
Is it that unattractive
to have to take it off?

100
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:56,575
Have you ever seen one with it?

101
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,951
No.

102
00:04:58,494 --> 00:05:00,555
You wouldn't even
know what it was.

103
00:05:03,135 --> 00:05:04,433
Anyway, I called him back.

104
00:05:04,593 --> 00:05:09,033
I told him I had to visit my father
in the hospital in Maryland.

105
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:12,338
You better catch it here, Charlie,
because this ain't Philadelphia!

106
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:13,989
- George?
- Yeah?

107
00:05:14,144 --> 00:05:16,861
Hi. I'm Leonard West.

108
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:19,967
- Nina's father.
- Hi, hi, Mr. West. I'm sorry.

109
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:21,470
- This is my friend Elaine.
- Hi.

110
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:25,606
Hey, .230 ain't gonna
cut it in this town, babe!

111
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:27,262
This is Kramer.

112
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:28,911
Hey, how you doing?

113
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:32,359
Yes! Yes!

114
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,468
- How are the seats?
- Okay.

115
00:05:36,623 --> 00:05:38,379
- Great. They're great.
- I hear you bought...

116
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,723
...one of Nina's paintings.
- It's being framed now.

117
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:42,223
I don't even know what it costs.

118
00:05:42,454 --> 00:05:44,134
Not too expensive, is it?

119
00:05:44,295 --> 00:05:45,943
Not if you have a lot of money.

120
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,161
It was cheaper for me
when she was an actress.

121
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,187
Well...

122
00:05:55,036 --> 00:05:56,760
- Enjoy the game.
- Thanks.

123
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:59,098
I think you better take
off the Orioles cap.

124
00:05:59,256 --> 00:06:00,521
Yeah. I better.

125
00:06:00,675 --> 00:06:02,508
No, no. Seriously.
You're in the owner's box.

126
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,546
I don't think it's a good idea.

127
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:07,496
- You're not serious.
- Yes, yes, yes, I am.

128
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:10,830
- Did he say that?
- No, but he gave me the seats.

129
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:13,208
I don't think he'd like you
wearing an Orioles cap.

130
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,248
- Maybe you should ask him.
- I don't have to.

131
00:06:15,405 --> 00:06:17,086
Are you gonna take
the hat off or not?

132
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:18,424
No. I'm not gonna
take it off.

133
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:20,008
Why should I?
That's ridiculous.

134
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:21,656
Just take the cap off.

135
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:24,267
George, I am at a baseball game.

136
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,947
- This is America.
- Look!

137
00:06:26,108 --> 00:06:28,322
Either you take the cap off
or you leave.

138
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:29,708
I'm not taking it off.

139
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,158
- Elaine, just take the cap off.
- No! Get off of my hat!

140
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:33,893
- What's...?
- What do you mean?!

141
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:35,542
- Stop it!
- Just take it off!

142
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:38,837
- There's your cap!
- Let's go.

143
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:41,909
Oh, my God. All right,
get your hands off of me!

144
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:44,978
- I'm leaving.
- Wait a minute. We just got here.

145
00:06:45,134 --> 00:06:46,509
Do you want us to go with you?

146
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:48,809
- No, you stay.
- Get your cap, George.

147
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,880
- Well, I was just thinking...
- Yeah. Stay!

148
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:53,027
All right, all right, we'll go, we'll go.

149
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,035
And then the ball hits him in the head,
and he falls right over the railing.

150
00:07:04,276 --> 00:07:06,916
- Is he okay?
- Well, yeah, he's fine.

151
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:10,175
We took him to the emergency room.
The x-rays were all negative.

152
00:07:10,567 --> 00:07:12,781
It was quite a day.

153
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:14,898
This is the most amazing story
I've ever heard.

154
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:17,008
Why did he want you to take
off the baseball cap?

155
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:18,507
- That is so insane.
- I know.

156
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:20,646
Can you imagine that?

157
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:27,166
- How you feeling?
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine.

158
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:28,934
Hi, Carol.

159
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:31,234
Hey, look. We made the paper.

160
00:07:33,238 --> 00:07:36,107
Look at this. Page two, sports section.
We're all in the picture.

161
00:07:36,268 --> 00:07:37,610
- Picture?
- Picture.

162
00:07:37,764 --> 00:07:39,979
- Our picture's in there? What?
- Yeah.

163
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:42,325
I cannot believe this.

164
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:44,468
- There's George.
- Look at him.

165
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,431
Oh, my God!
Lippman could see this!

166
00:07:46,587 --> 00:07:48,846
He thinks I was visiting my father.
Oh, my God!

167
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:53,335
I make up one little white lie,
and they put my picture in the paper!

168
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,707
Hi, Mr. Lippman.

169
00:07:57,788 --> 00:07:59,359
How's your father?

170
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,151
My... My father.

171
00:08:03,312 --> 00:08:05,526
Yeah. You went to see him, right?

172
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,217
Yeah.

173
00:08:07,378 --> 00:08:09,637
- I went to visit him.
- So...

174
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:13,624
...what was wrong with him?
- Well, you name it. You know...

175
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:18,149
Neuritis, neuralgia.

176
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,604
But he's feeling better now, right?

177
00:08:21,763 --> 00:08:23,563
Yes. Yeah. It's such a miracle.

178
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,327
You know, my visit must have
buoyed his spirits.

179
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:28,470
Buoyed.

180
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,384
- What did I say?
- You said "boy'd."

181
00:08:31,814 --> 00:08:33,843
- I did?
- Yeah.

182
00:08:44,127 --> 00:08:45,349
Well, I got a plane to catch.

183
00:08:45,508 --> 00:08:47,766
- Where are you going?
- Going to Houston for a few days.

184
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:49,496
Publishers' convention.

185
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,184
Can I have my sports section?

186
00:08:53,717 --> 00:08:55,397
- Oh, yeah.
- Sports section.

187
00:08:55,558 --> 00:08:58,351
I'm saving it for the plane. I never
miss the Sunday sports section.

188
00:08:58,512 --> 00:09:00,694
There's nothing to read.
It's yesterday's news.

189
00:09:00,852 --> 00:09:03,535
The Yankees won, the Mets lost,
Rickey Henderson's unhappy.

190
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:05,142
Right. Right.

191
00:09:05,302 --> 00:09:07,440
What are you doing?

192
00:09:08,677 --> 00:09:11,928
That is the third time today
I have done that.

193
00:09:13,472 --> 00:09:16,953
I keep, you know, grabbing
newspapers and just tugging at them.

194
00:09:17,117 --> 00:09:18,643
Well, I gotta go.

195
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:21,870
Okay. Yes, well, you know,
have a nice trip.

196
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,435
Alrighty. I'll just
hold down the fort.

197
00:09:30,773 --> 00:09:33,719
I sense great vulnerability...

198
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,833
...a man-child crying out for love...

199
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,819
...an innocent orphan
in the postmodern world.

200
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:41,964
I see a parasite.

201
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:45,798
A sexually depraved miscreant...

202
00:09:45,963 --> 00:09:51,102
...who is seeking only to gratify his
basest and most immediate urges.

203
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,555
She was a guest of my father's.

204
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:56,968
- She should've taken the cap off.
- It's preposterous...

205
00:09:57,126 --> 00:09:59,963
...to ask someone to take off a
baseball cap at a baseball game.

206
00:10:00,118 --> 00:10:01,296
How can you defend that?

207
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:04,024
His struggle is man's struggle.

208
00:10:04,184 --> 00:10:06,214
He lifts my spirit.

209
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:09,208
He is a loathsome, offensive brute.

210
00:10:09,862 --> 00:10:11,847
Yet I can't look away.

211
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:15,614
Look, I'm tired of all this fighting.

212
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:18,911
Maybe we should end this before
we really start hating each other.

213
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:22,548
You wouldn't want that, because you
always have to remain friends.

214
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:25,854
I like to remain friends
with people I was friends with.

215
00:10:26,855 --> 00:10:29,266
Hey, why don't you just go then?

216
00:10:29,425 --> 00:10:33,222
And give this to George.
Tell him he owes me $500.

217
00:10:34,604 --> 00:10:37,746
He transcends time and space.

218
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:40,884
He sickens me.

219
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:44,883
I love it.

220
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:47,176
Me too.

221
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,857
Five hundred dollars?

222
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:54,393
- What?
- That's what she told me.

223
00:10:54,935 --> 00:10:56,997
I'm not paying $500 for this!

224
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,501
It's a piece of junk!

225
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,949
- That's what it costs.
- Why did you take it?

226
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:04,057
- You broke up with her.
- I wasn't thinking. I don't know.

227
00:11:04,218 --> 00:11:06,400
You weren't thinking.

228
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:10,200
I mean, she framed it
and everything.

229
00:11:10,355 --> 00:11:12,111
I'm not buying this.
No way. Forget it.

230
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:13,571
No way I'm buying this.

231
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:15,870
I mean, look at it! What is it?

232
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:18,482
It's a bunch of squiggly lines.

233
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:20,321
Are you telling me you
couldn't paint this?

234
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:23,778
You want me to paint you something?
I'd love to paint you something.

235
00:11:24,472 --> 00:11:25,650
I'm not paying for this.

236
00:11:25,814 --> 00:11:28,455
If you were going out with her,
it'd be a different story.

237
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,369
This was in front of your door.

238
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,904
- Hey, Kramer.
- Hi, Mike.

239
00:11:36,287 --> 00:11:37,661
Wow, a letter from Nina!

240
00:11:38,588 --> 00:11:42,036
Man, that is the ugliest thing
I've ever seen.

241
00:11:43,422 --> 00:11:45,331
- Oh, my God.
- What?

242
00:11:45,493 --> 00:11:47,632
This is amazing.
You can't believe this.

243
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:50,664
Listen to this. " I don't know what
you expect to find, Jerry.

244
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:53,924
You know what you want better than
me, but there's one thing I do know.

245
00:11:54,086 --> 00:11:56,071
I can stand here watching
you try to destroy...

246
00:11:56,234 --> 00:11:58,143
...everything I've ever
wanted in my life...

247
00:11:58,305 --> 00:12:02,211
...wanting to smash your face with my
fists because you won't even make...

248
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:05,546
...the slightest effort to opt for
happiness and still know I love you.

249
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:08,043
You mean so much to me,
I'm willing to take your abuse...

250
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:09,500
...insults and insensitivity."

251
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,874
- Wow.
- She's deep.

252
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:15,986
"Because that's what you need to
do to prove I'm not gonna leave you.

253
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:19,055
I'm sick and tired of running from
places and people and relationships.

254
00:12:19,212 --> 00:12:21,503
You want me,
then fight for me, beca...

255
00:12:23,546 --> 00:12:25,837
Because I'm sure as hell
fighting for you.

256
00:12:26,922 --> 00:12:28,296
I think we're both worth it."

257
00:12:37,318 --> 00:12:39,041
You know, Jerry,
she sounds like a poet.

258
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:41,531
Boy, no one's ever written me
a letter like this.

259
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:43,414
Maybe I was wrong about her.

260
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,253
Get in there and give her a call.
Pick up the phone and call her.

261
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:49,475
- Should I?
- Yes, you're damn right you should!

262
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:52,080
Fight for her, Jerry!
She's sure the hell fighting for you!

263
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,504
All right!

264
00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:56,532
I'll call her.

265
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:12,642
Don't go in there.
You're gonna get shot.

266
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:15,170
I told you.

267
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:19,046
- Yeah.
- It's George.

268
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:20,625
Come on up.

269
00:13:21,815 --> 00:13:24,914
Well, now we gotta get
a posse together.

270
00:13:25,498 --> 00:13:26,795
I love a good posse.

271
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,754
What's the appeal of the posse?

272
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,174
The appeal of the posse?

273
00:13:31,328 --> 00:13:33,128
Posse has tremendous appeal.

274
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:36,765
Get away from the job, you camp out,
you're with friends.

275
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:41,829
Come on, it's a week-long game of
hide and go seek on horseback.

276
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:44,973
Hello, George.

277
00:13:45,138 --> 00:13:46,861
Hey. Hey, Nina.

278
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,503
I owe you some money, don't I?

279
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:56,874
- Well, I really love that piece.
- Me too. Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

280
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,051
You know, in fact, I've been
thinking about it, and...

281
00:14:00,213 --> 00:14:02,505
...you know, I feel like
I'm stealing from you.

282
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:05,887
Five hundred dollars! This is
gonna be worth thousands soon.

283
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:09,033
You know what? On second thought,
I can't even accept this.

284
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,822
No, no, no. George, a deal's a deal.
I want you to have it.

285
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:15,930
This could be in a museum someday.
It's not safe with me.

286
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:18,735
It should really be
in a doorman building.

287
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:21,229
Honestly, George,
the money's not important.

288
00:14:21,388 --> 00:14:22,992
Who said anything about money?

289
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:26,216
- Yeah.
- It's Elaine.

290
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,520
Come on up.

291
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,130
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

292
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:31,966
She does not believe in telephones,
does she?

293
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:35,532
She likes the pop-in.
I've told her how I hate the pop-in.

294
00:14:35,696 --> 00:14:37,115
He likes the pop-in too.

295
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:39,603
Just popped in now.
I'm a big pop-in guy.

296
00:14:39,763 --> 00:14:41,595
- He is.
- What about Kramer?

297
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:43,896
Huge pop-in guy.

298
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:48,080
Well, I was leaving anyway.
So we're on for tomorrow?

299
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,455
- Yeah.
- Okay. Bye.

300
00:14:52,153 --> 00:14:53,680
Hello.

301
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:57,016
Chatty gal.

302
00:14:58,406 --> 00:15:00,664
Lippman's coming back tomorrow.
I'll be fired.

303
00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:02,655
If he noticed it,
he would have called you.

304
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:05,108
No. He wants to torture me.

305
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:07,337
Will you give me the clicker?

306
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:09,864
I hate it when you have the clicker.
You're too fast.

307
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:12,821
Get out!
I'm a great clicker.

308
00:15:13,596 --> 00:15:14,894
I have great instincts.

309
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:17,039
How dare you impugn my clicking.

310
00:15:17,394 --> 00:15:19,608
You're all over the dial.
You don't know what you want.

311
00:15:19,772 --> 00:15:22,871
You never stay on anything longer
than five seconds. Just give me that.

312
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:24,789
- Let go.
- Come on. I want it, Jerry!

313
00:15:24,951 --> 00:15:26,707
- Let go, Elaine!
- Then let George do it!

314
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:28,516
- George can't click!
- Give it to me!

315
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:30,504
Give it! Give it! Give it!

316
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,270
Pinheads.

317
00:15:33,045 --> 00:15:34,648
Maybe I can't...

318
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,826
...analyse and theorize and...

319
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,325
...speculate on why we...

320
00:15:41,484 --> 00:15:43,436
Wait a second. Go back to that.
Go back to that.

321
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:45,465
Hey, you read all those books,
not me.

322
00:15:45,627 --> 00:15:47,153
It's Chapter Two.
It's Neil Simon.

323
00:15:47,315 --> 00:15:49,344
But one thing I do know.

324
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:51,224
I know how I feel.

325
00:15:52,225 --> 00:15:54,057
Wait a second.
Wait a second!

326
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,979
- What?
- My God. The letter. That's the letter!

327
00:15:57,327 --> 00:15:59,508
- What letter?
- This is the letter she wrote to me.

328
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,542
She stole it from the movie!

329
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,965
Because you don't even mak e...

330
00:16:03,119 --> 00:16:05,726
"The slightest effort
to opt for happiness...

331
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,132
...and still know that I love you!"

332
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,318
This is incredible.

333
00:16:11,481 --> 00:16:14,929
I always thought there was something
funny about this letter.

334
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:16,767
She's copied it right out of
Chapter Two.

335
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:18,761
She's a thief! A bunco artist.

336
00:16:18,923 --> 00:16:21,138
Maybe I won't send her that check.

337
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:26,902
You know, it's not really that terrible.

338
00:16:27,056 --> 00:16:30,230
What are you talking about? She
completely misrepresented herself.

339
00:16:30,393 --> 00:16:33,185
I don't opt for happiness.
I opt for happiness.

340
00:16:33,347 --> 00:16:35,910
James Caan doesn't
opt for happiness.

341
00:16:38,794 --> 00:16:39,939
Yeah. Yeah.

342
00:16:40,136 --> 00:16:41,936
She wouldn't take the cap off?

343
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:46,535
No. But didn't she know they
were the owner's seats?

344
00:16:46,696 --> 00:16:49,151
Oh, that's unbelievable.

345
00:16:49,304 --> 00:16:51,792
Yeah, okay. All right, Lenny.

346
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:53,249
Thanks again.

347
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:55,056
Take care.

348
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:59,579
That's Lenny West, my accountant,
who's a hell of a guy.

349
00:16:59,738 --> 00:17:02,029
He handles the Yankees too.
It's his biggest account.

350
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:06,254
So every once in a while,
they throw him a couple of seats...

351
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:09,555
...and last weekend,
he gave them to his daughter.

352
00:17:09,865 --> 00:17:12,473
She's an artist, by the way.
Anyway...

353
00:17:12,627 --> 00:17:15,191
...her daughter gives them
to some friends, you know?

354
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:17,489
One of her friends shows up...

355
00:17:17,652 --> 00:17:19,638
...wearing a Baltimore cap.

356
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:22,899
You're from Baltimore, right?

357
00:17:24,596 --> 00:17:26,887
It's Towson.
That's near Baltimore.

358
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:28,731
But you're an Oriole fan, right?

359
00:17:28,892 --> 00:17:31,183
Well, fan...
You know, my father...

360
00:17:31,347 --> 00:17:34,216
Anyway, she refused
to take the cap off.

361
00:17:34,377 --> 00:17:35,796
She caused a whole big scene.

362
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:37,936
Really? That's so impudent.

363
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,469
Yeah. So Lenny gave me
the tickets for tomorrow night.

364
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,540
I'm inviting Frank and Marsha.
Want you to come.

365
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,519
I've got plans, though, Mr. Lippman.

366
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,055
Well, break them.

367
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:54,622
You missed the bris.
I want you at the game.

368
00:17:56,665 --> 00:17:58,803
Okay. Okay.

369
00:17:58,966 --> 00:18:01,257
- Good.
- Okay, Mr. Lippman.

370
00:18:03,531 --> 00:18:06,859
And, Elaine, you know the Baltimore
cap you got in your office...

371
00:18:07,022 --> 00:18:09,477
...wear it. I'm gonna have
a little fun with him.

372
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:13,769
That will be fun.

373
00:18:17,034 --> 00:18:18,255
How's it coming?

374
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,287
Good. Good.

375
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:23,968
Seen any good movies lately?

376
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:27,116
No. Not really.

377
00:18:27,276 --> 00:18:29,534
- You?
- No.

378
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,722
I like a good comedy.

379
00:18:31,879 --> 00:18:34,334
You know, like a Neil Simon.

380
00:18:34,487 --> 00:18:37,247
- You like Neil Simon?
- Neil Simon?

381
00:18:37,556 --> 00:18:38,898
Some of his stuff.

382
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:40,808
I've seen most of it.

383
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:43,687
I guess my favourite
would have to be...

384
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:45,680
...Chapter Two.

385
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:48,526
Have you ever seen that?

386
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:52,201
I don't know. Maybe.

387
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,848
I have.

388
00:18:54,588 --> 00:18:56,802
Funny. Funny.

389
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:58,876
In fact, it was on TV
just the other night.

390
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,641
Happened to catch it.

391
00:19:00,802 --> 00:19:03,901
I couldn't help but notice...

392
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:06,168
...a stunning similarity...

393
00:19:06,326 --> 00:19:08,050
Well, we've made our decision.

394
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:09,809
We want the Kramer.

395
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:16,365
Five thousand? Why would anybody
buy Kramer for $5000?

396
00:19:18,563 --> 00:19:21,171
Boy, the Yankees cannot
buy a hit tonight.

397
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:25,348
So is it all over between you
and Marsha Mason?

398
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,572
Yeah.

399
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:30,568
And by the way, can you get
this thing out of my house?

400
00:19:30,723 --> 00:19:32,142
I'll make a deal with you.

401
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:35,013
- I'll sell it to you for 10 bucks.
- Please.

402
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:40,039
Seems to be a lot of trouble in the
area just behind the Yank ee dugout.

403
00:19:40,467 --> 00:19:43,074
Behind the dugout? That's where
we were sitting the other night.

404
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:46,250
We're not gonna show it, don't want
to encourage that kind of behaviour.

405
00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:49,893
It's a young lady, and she's really
going at it with the security guard.

406
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:53,504
She's a feisty one. They're getting the
other security guard to come down.

407
00:19:53,663 --> 00:19:54,840
How do you lik e that, Seaver?

408
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:57,339
And, boy, she's something,
and a Baltimore fan at that.

409
00:19:57,499 --> 00:19:59,484
Holy cow!

410
00:20:02,178 --> 00:20:07,852
When I was 17, I ran away from home
and hopped a steamship to Sweden.

411
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:12,036
- This steak is excellent, by the way.
- More potatoes?

412
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,565
Yeah, yeah, sure. Please.

413
00:20:13,725 --> 00:20:17,674
Yes, yes, go on. You hopped
a steamship to Sweden?

414
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:21,663
It was a big one.

415
00:20:21,819 --> 00:20:24,382
Baseball season's starting.
I'm very excited about that.

416
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:27,182
Did you ever sneak down
to better seats at the game...

417
00:20:27,343 --> 00:20:28,990
...and get caught by the usher?

418
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:32,167
When you're a kid, you're getting
chased from every place anyway.

419
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:34,544
When you're an adult,
it's really embarrassing.

420
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:37,500
You have to pretend like there's
some confusion.

421
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:40,920
You put on this whole act.
You're looking at the tickets.

422
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:43,912
"I don't understand how this
could have happened.

423
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:45,823
Let me see. I see the problem.

424
00:20:45,986 --> 00:20:48,822
These are very good seats.
I have very bad seats.

425
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:51,344
That's the misunderstanding."

426
