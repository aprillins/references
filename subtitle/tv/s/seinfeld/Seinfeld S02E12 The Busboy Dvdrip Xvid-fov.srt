1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
I'm not a foodie.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,800
I don't:

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,800
"Oh, this is too rare.
Oh, it's too salty."

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,000
Just eat it and shut up.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,600
I'll eat anywhere,
whatever they're having.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,500
I've eaten rolls off of
room-service trays in hotel hallways.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,500
I have. That's not a joke.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,900
This is my life.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,100
I don't know, somebody left it.

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,000
Why would somebody poison a roll
and leave it in the hallway...

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,700
...for some comic coming down
at 2:00 in the morning?

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,800
Why would they do that?

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,700
Sometimes you go to a restaurant,
they put the check in a little book.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,600
What is this,
the story of the bill?

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,700
"Once upon a time, there were some
very hungry people." What is this?

16
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,100
Little gold tassel hanging down.
Am I graduating from the restaurant?

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,800
What is this about?

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,500
You want some of mine?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,300
- Take some of mine.
- Why do I get pesto?

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,700
Why do I think I'll like it?

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,400
I keep trying to like it.

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,100
- Like I have to like it.
- Who said you have to like it?

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,800
Everybody likes pesto.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,900
You walk into a restaurant,
that's all you hear. Pesto. Pesto.

25
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,900
- I don't like pesto.
- Where was pesto 10 years ago?

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,000
Look at that guy.

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,500
I'll bet you he's getting
hair transplants.

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,400
Anytime you see a guy that age
wearing a baseball cap, 10-1, plugs.

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,600
The thing about that painting
is with the colours and...

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,800
Oh, yeah, plugola.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,500
One more thing about the car.
Let it warm up for a minute.

32
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,400
Yeah, that's a tough minute.

33
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,900
It's like waiting in the shower
for the conditioner to work.

34
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't understand why
he couldn't take a cab.

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,100
- Who?
- Elaine is having...

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,600
...a houseguest.

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,700
She's picking him up
at the airport tonight.

38
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,000
- A guy?
- Yes, it's a guy.

39
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,500
He's from Yakima, right?

40
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,900
- Seattle.
- Everybody's moving to Seattle.

41
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,900
It's the pesto of cities. So?

42
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,100
Well, you tell.

43
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Well, from what I can piece together,
our friend here met a gentleman...

44
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
- Ed.
- Who was in town...

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,000
...on a business venture, and...?

46
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:30,000
We shared
an interpersonal experience.

47
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,000
- Go on.
- So they went out a few times...

48
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,900
...but, apparently, when the fellow
returned home...

49
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,900
...he discovered that the Benes tattoo
does not wash off so easily.

50
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,400
On some people.

51
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,000
So he's coming to stay with her
for a week.

52
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,700
It was just gonna be a weekend,
but then, somehow, it became a week.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
- Wait a second.
- All right, okay.

54
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,900
- All right, all right, okay.
- What happened?

55
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,800
Oh, the busboy left the menu
a little close to the candle.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,300
I'm sorry for the disturbance.

57
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,700
- I'm never eating here again.
- Yeah.

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,700
- Nice going.
- Thank you.

59
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,500
- That ought to get us a free dessert.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,800
I think the busboy's in trouble.

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,700
Did I get him in trouble
because of what I said?

62
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,300
I just told him what happened.
He didn't do it on purpose.

63
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,800
He pointed at me.

64
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,700
- Why did they point at me?
- I said I would never eat here again...

65
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,800
...but he had to know I was kidding.

66
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
I didn't say anything.

67
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,500
I can't believe it. He's going.
He's fired.

68
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,000
- Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
- I didn't know he'd get fired.

69
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,500
He'll probably kill his family
over this.

70
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,000
What if he's waiting for me outside?

71
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
He pointed at me.
Did you see him point?

72
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,100
Lot of ex-cons become busboys.

73
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,300
They seem to gravitate towards it.

74
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,300
- Was it my fault?
- Was it my fault?

75
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,800
Maybe I'll try that pesto.

76
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,100
Look, I feel bad for him too,
but he'll get another job.

77
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,400
Let's face it, it's not a profession
where you embellish your résumé...

78
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,600
...and undergo a series
of gruelling interviews.

79
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,000
- Like you really know busboys.
- Oh, like you do.

80
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,600
- Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
- Camp.

81
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,700
It was a fat camp.
Those kids depended on me.

82
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,600
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,800
Busboys are always changing jobs.
That's the business.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,600
I know, I work with these guys.

85
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,000
I talk with them in the kitchens
at the comedy clubs.

86
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,700
Why don't you get him another job?

87
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,300
I'd love to. But I don't know
anything about him.

88
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,400
He could walk around the street
pricking people with pins.

89
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
I don't know if you people
are aware of this...

90
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
...but I am one clever chickadee.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,700
What, did you get
the busboy's number?

92
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,200
His phone's been disconnected,
but I was able to obtain an address.

93
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,500
1324 Amsterdam Avenue,
apartment 4D.

94
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,500
Now, I did my job.

95
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,800
- May I have the car keys, please?
- How did you get all this?

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,900
Does the word "charm"
mean anything to you?

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,300
No.

98
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,600
Now you're going to his apartment?
I think this is nuts.

99
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,600
I'd like to apologize. I wanna tell him
I didn't mean to get him in trouble.

100
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,600
- So you're going now?
- Yeah.

101
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,600
I'm gonna see if there's anything
I can do.

102
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,800
Get him another job.
Maybe I'll hear of something.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Maybe the fat camp.

104
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,400
- You're not going?
- I would...

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,700
...but I have to pick up Ed
at the airport.

106
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,900
I just don't think
you should go alone.

107
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,600
- Can't you wait till after my set?
- It will take too long.

108
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,900
- Hey.
- Hey.

109
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,900
Take the K-Man.

110
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,000
A little support.

111
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,400
- I don't...
- What? What? Take me where?

112
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,300
Where?

113
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,900
Look, I really appreciate
your coming...

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,400
...but if you wouldn't mind...

115
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,400
...try not to say too much.

116
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,500
What am I gonna say?

117
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,900
I don't know.

118
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,900
Well, I'm not an idiot.

119
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,900
Certainly not.

120
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,200
Then we're cool.

121
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,900
Yeah.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,300
Yeah, we're cool.

123
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,400
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was in the restaurant earlier...

124
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,100
...and I was wondering if I could
talk to you about what happened.

125
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,900
Thanks.

126
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,000
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
It's just that...

127
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,400
...I think I may have,
without realizing it...

128
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,600
...been responsible
for getting you fired.

129
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,600
And I just...

130
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,500
I wanted you to know that I did
not intend for that to happen.

131
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,800
He's a hell of a guy.

132
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,800
This is...

133
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
...a guy I know. Kramer.

134
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,300
Oh, my God.

135
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,300
Waterbed?

136
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,200
Anyway, I...

137
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,900
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm really sorry that happened.

138
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,500
And if I can help out in any way,
I'll certainly be glad to do that.

139
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,500
Well, I guess that's about it.

140
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,900
You got anything to drink?

141
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,100
- We really should be going.
- Let me get a glass of water.

142
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,800
Hurry up.

143
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
Paquita?

144
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,800
Paquita?

145
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,700
His cat's gone.

146
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,900
Who left the door open?

147
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,600
Who left the door open?

148
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Come on! Come on! Help me look!

149
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,000
You know, the cats,
they run away all the time.

150
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,400
You know, my aunt, she had a cat,
ran away, showed up three years later.

151
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,200
You never know.

152
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,400
They got things in their brains.
They remember where they're from.

153
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,500
Unless somebody starts feeding her.
See, that's what you gotta worry about.

154
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,400
Once again, Antonio,
I can't even begin to say...

155
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,600
...how deeply, deeply sorry
I am about everything.

156
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,600
The job...

157
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,200
...the cat...

158
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,800
The lamp.

159
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,200
There's wire sticking out.

160
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah.

161
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Here's my card.

162
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,100
I'm in real estate.

163
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,700
So if you're ever looking for
something bigger, something nicer...

164
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,200
Maybe not right away.

165
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,200
Anyway...

166
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,500
You ought to get that wire fixed.

167
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,900
I got the door.

168
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,900
George, stop worrying about this guy.
It wasn't your fault.

169
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,900
Come on. He's not stalking you.

170
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,600
He doesn't even know where you live.

172
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,400
Who told you to give him
your business card?

173
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,400
That's Elaine.

174
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,100
Kramer.

175
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,200
George wants to know when
you wanna go look for the cat again.

176
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,500
Well, it's been a week.
It's up to the cat now.

177
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:29,400
Kramer says it's up to the cat now.

178
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,100
It'll be on your conscience.

179
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,100
- Oh, how do you figure?
- How do you figure?

180
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,900
You're the one who left
the door open.

181
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,300
Why was I in charge
of closing the door?

182
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,100
Why was he in charge
of closing the door?

183
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,600
Because you came in after him.

184
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,800
- So?
- So?

185
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,000
- Last person in should close the door.
- Let me talk to him.

186
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,200
Talk... Call him from your house.

187
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He's calling you now.

188
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,600
Okay.

189
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,500
Ed's downstairs.
Can I have the car keys?

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,400
- No "hello"?
- You got any aspirin?

191
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,600
Hello.

192
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,200
Now, lookit, you guarantee me...

193
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,300
...this car's gonna get me
to the airport tomorrow, no problem?

194
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Guarantee? Hey, it's a car.

195
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,200
Because if there's even
the slightest chance of any problem...

196
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,600
...I don't wanna take it. If I don't
get this guy on a plane to Seattle...

197
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,400
...and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him
and anyone who tries to stop me.

198
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,400
So did you have
a nice week together?

199
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,000
I heard a little ping in the car last time.
What was that ping?

200
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,500
There's no ping.
Why are you so wacky?

201
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,200
Jerry, you cannot imagine
how much I hate this guy.

202
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,500
And he hasn't even done anything.
It's this situation.

203
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,900
He's a wonderful guy,
but I hate his guts.

204
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,800
So have you two been...?

205
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,700
No!

206
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,300
I told him I've been having my period
the last five days.

207
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,400
And I'm sleeping all squished
over on the edge of my bed.

208
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,300
But I've only got 14 hours to go,
and nothing can go wrong now.

209
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,400
I've taken care of everything.
I've confirmed the plane reservation...

210
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
...checked weather...
- What's your airport route?

211
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
I got it all mapped out.
I'm taking the tunnel.

212
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,300
What about the Van Wyck?

213
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,200
I spoke to a cab driver.

214
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,400
For 5 bucks, he turned me onto
the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.

215
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,700
Now look, his plane leaves at 10: 15,
we're getting up at about 8.

216
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,600
- Gives us enough time, right?
- You still using that alarm clock?

217
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,400
No, I bought a new one today.
It's got everything.

218
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,700
If you oversleep, a hand comes out
and slaps you in the face.

219
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,900
Flying doesn't make me nervous.
Driving to the airport...

220
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,600
...can make you very nervous.

221
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,000
Because when you're flying,
getting on a plane...

222
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,600
...if you miss that plane,
there's no alternative.

223
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,100
On the ground, you have options.

224
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,700
You have buses, you have taxis,
you have trains.

225
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,900
But when you're taking a flight,
if you miss it, that's it.

226
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,000
No airline goes, "Well, you missed
the flight. We do have a cannon...

227
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,400
...leaving in 10 minutes.
Would you be interested in that?

228
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,200
It's not a direct cannon. You have
to change cannons after you land."

229
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,700
"Sir, where are you going,
Chicago?

230
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,300
Oh, Dallas. All right. Wait a second.

231
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,700
Dallas, that's about Dallas. Texas,
anyway. You should hit Texas. Ready?

232
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,700
Get out of the net immediately...

233
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,100
...because we shoot the luggage in
right after you."

234
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Get up. The alarm didn't go off.
You're gonna miss the plane, it's 9: 15.

235
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,800
- 9: 15?
- Yeah. It's 9: 15!

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,700
We'll never make it.
I'll leave tomorrow.

237
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,600
Tomorrow? Are you crazy?
No. Now, now, let's go.

238
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,600
Let's go. You get dressed,
you get dressed.

239
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,300
- Can I shower?
- Shower? Are you out of your mind?

240
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,800
I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.

241
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,500
Forget the shower. The shower's out.
Just move it. Put your clothes on.

242
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,800
- Where are you going?
- The kitchen.

243
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
- The kitchen?
- Got a bag of cashews in there.

244
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,000
No, they're not making it.
Here, put your pants on.

245
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,800
- Put your pants on.
- What's the big deal?

246
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,300
- I'll go tomorrow or the next day.
- No, you have your ticket.

247
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,200
- You have to go now.
- We'll never make it.

248
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,600
- Don't say that.
- Well, it takes 45 minutes to get...

249
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,100
It takes 45 minutes to get there.
That will only leave me five minutes...

250
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,300
...to get to the plane.
- Shut up and pack!

251
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,600
And what if I don't make the plane?
You'll have left. Then what do I do?

252
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,500
You're talking too much.

253
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,700
- Where's my sweater?
- What?

254
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,500
- My brown sweater.
- What sweater?

255
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,900
- My brown sweater.
- You didn't bring a brown sweater.

256
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,400
- I got a brown sweater.
- Here. You want a sweater?

257
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,700
You want a brown sweater,
you got a brown sweater.

258
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,100
- I can't take your sweater.
- It's brown!

259
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,300
What are you doing?

260
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,500
No. There's no time for folding,
no time for folding. I think that's it.

261
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,400
- My shoes, you packed my shoes.
- Shoes? Shoes?

262
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,800
Shoes weren't invented till
the fourth century.

263
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,400
People walked around
for thousands of years without them!

264
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,400
I have this! Let's go. Let's go.

265
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,300
- Anywhere in the city?
- Anywhere in the city.

266
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,300
I'll tell you the best public toilet.

267
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,900
Okay...

268
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,400
...54th and Sixth.

269
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,700
Sperry-Rand building,
14th floor, Morgan Apparel.

270
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,400
Mention my name,
she'll give you the key.

271
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,900
All right, 65th and 10th.

272
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,200
Are you kidding?

273
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,100
Lincoln Center, Alice Tully Hall,
the Met.

274
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,500
Magnificent facilities.

275
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,600
I never knew I could drive like that.

276
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,100
I was going faster
than I've ever gone before.

277
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,300
And yet it all seemed
to be happening in slow motion.

278
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,900
I was seeing three
and four moves ahead...

279
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,100
...weaving in and out of lanes like an
Olympic skier on a gold-medal run.

280
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,500
I knew I was challenging
the very laws of physics.

281
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,700
At Queens Boulevard,
I took the shoulder.

282
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,700
At Jewel Avenue, I used the median.

283
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,300
I had it. I was there. And then...

284
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,900
...I hit the Van Wyck.

285
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,700
They say no one's ever beaten
the Van Wyck...

286
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,800
...but, gentlemen, I tell you this:

287
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,200
I came as close as anyone ever has.

288
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,700
And if it hadn't been
for that five-car pileup...

289
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,900
...on Rockaway Boulevard...

290
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,800
...that numbskull...

291
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,500
...would be on a plane
for Seattle right now...

292
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,700
...instead of looking
for a parking space...

293
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,000
...downstairs.

294
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,400
- You did everything.
- You tried.

295
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,800
The busboy's coming.

296
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,600
- The busboy's coming.
- The busboy's coming?

297
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,400
- You don't mean here.
- I buzzed him in. He's on his way up.

298
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,400
He's coming up?
I'll check you out later.

299
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,400
- Where are you going?
- I'm the one he wants.

300
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,700
- He's coming to settle the score.
- No. You three all know each other.

301
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,200
There's no point in me
getting involved at this stage.

302
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,300
No, he's not gonna do anything.
I guarantee it.

303
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,800
The hell with it! Let him kill me, l...

304
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,000
Antonio! Antonio, in here.

305
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,000
Hey, Antonio, how's it going?

306
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,000
Three nights ago...

307
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,200
...a gas main beneath
the restaurant exploded...

308
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,200
...killing five people in my section...

309
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,600
...including the busboy
who replaced me.

310
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,500
If I'm not fired that night
because of you...

311
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,200
...and your thoughtless,
stupid, insensitive remarks...

312
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,900
...it would have been me.

313
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,800
You saved my life!

314
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,600
Come on.

315
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,700
- Yeah?
- It's Eddie.

316
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,000
- He's coming up.
- And the same night of the accident...

317
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,000
...while looking for Paquita...

318
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,400
...I find a job in a restaurant
where they pay me...

319
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
...almost twice
what I was making before.

320
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,500
And, when I returned
to the apartment...

321
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,400
...Paquita, perhaps frightened
from the explosion...

322
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,700
...had miraculously returned.

323
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,200
Well...

324
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,400
...now I must go, for today
I am starting my new, wonderful job...

325
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,300
...and I am very late.

326
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,800
Thank you.

327
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,300
Thank you. Thank you all.

328
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,400
Hey, watch where you're going.
You almost knocked my head off.

329
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,400
Why don't you watch
where you're going, okay?

330
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,000
- Because you bumped into me.
- Who do you think you're talking to?

331
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,700
Hey, get your hands off me!

332
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,200
You go to hell!

333
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,200
He'll get another job.

334
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,900
He's a busboy.

335
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,900
It won't be for a while.

336
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,800
At least not till after the cast
comes off.

337
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That fall down the stairs,
that's what did it.

338
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,600
That's not how it happened.

339
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
It's when he fell on him
with his knee.

340
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,700
That was awful. Poor Antonio.

341
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,300
Thanks.

342
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,000
So, much longer?

343
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,000
Till when? Till he goes back to Seattle
or till he can feed himself?

344
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,800
I guess it's not important.

345
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,200
Take care of yourselves.

346
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,400
I should probably get going too.

347
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,300
If I don't feed Paquita by 7,
she goes all over everything.

348
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,400
Take it easy.

349
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,900
Yeah.

350
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,500
How you doing?

351
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,500
First of all, I can't believe
that people actually do fight.

352
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,500
People have fistfights in life.
I can't really believe...

353
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,300
...that we have boxing, either.
It's really an amazing thing.

354
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,300
The problem with boxing,
you have two guys having a fight...

355
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,200
...that have no prior argument.

356
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,200
Why don't they have the boxers
come into the ring in little cars...

357
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,900
...drive around a bit,
have a little accident, they get out:

358
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,200
"Didn't you see my signal?
Look at that fender!"

359
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,100
Then you'd see a real fight.

360
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
