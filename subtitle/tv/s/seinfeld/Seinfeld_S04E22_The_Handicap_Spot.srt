1
00:00:04,122 --> 00:00:05,953
You can't have adultery.
You commit it.

2
00:00:06,124 --> 00:00:09,719
You can't even commit adultery unless
you already have a commitment.

3
00:00:09,894 --> 00:00:13,386
So you have to make the commitment
before thinking about committing it.

4
00:00:13,565 --> 00:00:15,328
There's no commit without the commit.

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,901
Then, once you commit,
then you can commit the adultery.

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:21,436
Then you get caught, get divorced,
lose your mind...

7
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:23,096
...and they have you committed.

8
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:28,234
You know, some people actually cheat
on the people they're cheating with...

9
00:00:28,413 --> 00:00:30,779
...which is like, you know,
being in a holdup...

10
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:33,247
...and turning to the robber
next to you and going:

11
00:00:33,418 --> 00:00:35,409
"All right, give me everything
you have too."

12
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:42,893
You met her
at the supermarket? How?

13
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:45,621
Produce section.
Very provocative area.

14
00:00:45,797 --> 00:00:48,766
Lots of melons and shapes.
Everyone squeezing and smelling.

15
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:50,332
It just happened.

16
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:52,526
- So when you gonna see her?
- Tonight.

17
00:00:52,704 --> 00:00:56,140
- What's her name?
- I don't know.

18
00:00:56,307 --> 00:00:59,276
- How could you not know her name?
- I was nervous. I got distracted.

19
00:00:59,444 --> 00:01:02,004
It had something to do
with a car or a fish.

20
00:01:04,015 --> 00:01:07,451
Look at... Why do I get bananas?
They're good for one day.

21
00:01:08,686 --> 00:01:10,244
Oh, my God. I forgot to tell you.

22
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:12,981
I got a letter today from
the State Controller's Office.

23
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,749
Back in public school in Brooklyn...

24
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:17,451
...every week I put 50 cents
in the Lincoln Savings Bank.

25
00:01:17,629 --> 00:01:20,120
- Yeah, I did that too.
- Remember the little bankbook?

26
00:01:20,298 --> 00:01:23,927
I haven't put anything in it since sixth
grade. I completely forgot about it.

27
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:26,400
The State Controller's Office
tracks me down.

28
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:28,801
The interest has accumulated
to $ 1900.

29
00:01:28,973 --> 00:01:31,305
Nineteen hundred dollars.
They're sending me a check.

30
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:34,004
Yeah. Interest. It's an amazing thing.

31
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:37,412
You make money
without doing anything.

32
00:01:37,582 --> 00:01:40,813
I have some friends that try and base
their whole life on that principle.

33
00:01:40,985 --> 00:01:43,977
- Really? Who?
- Nobody you know.

34
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:47,149
Maybe I'll go down to the track,
put it all on a horse.

35
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:49,418
Why don't you put it in the bank.

36
00:01:49,594 --> 00:01:51,892
Bank? This is found money.

37
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:54,327
I want to parlay it.
I wanna make a big score.

38
00:01:54,932 --> 00:01:56,832
You mean you wanna lose it.

39
00:01:57,935 --> 00:02:01,427
Yeah. All right.

40
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:05,075
- You got it, huh?
- Yes, I did.

41
00:02:05,243 --> 00:02:07,177
- Yes.
- What's with the gloves?

42
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:10,712
Well, I'm staining my floors. You know,
I don't wanna get my hands dirty.

43
00:02:10,882 --> 00:02:13,180
- What, the whole apartment?
- The whole apartment.

44
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,478
And I'm buying
that fake-wood wallpaper.

45
00:02:15,653 --> 00:02:19,054
I'm gonna surround myself
in wood.

46
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,589
It's gonna be like a log cabin.

47
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:24,421
Because I need wood around me.

48
00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:27,860
Wood, Jerry. Wood.

49
00:02:28,032 --> 00:02:29,795
- Wood is good.
- Definitely.

50
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:32,094
So we're still going to play
racquetball, right?

51
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,103
- Yeah. Whenever you're ready.
- Okay. Soon as Elaine gets here.

52
00:02:36,174 --> 00:02:38,404
- What, you rented Home Alone?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,074
- I thought you saw that.
- No, I saw Home Alone 2.

54
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:44,043
Oh, right. But you hated it.

55
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:47,343
Well, I was lost.
I never saw the first one.

56
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:50,710
- By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
- What for?

57
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:53,823
If I watch it at my apartment,
I feel like I'm not doing anything.

58
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:56,892
If I watch it here, I'm out of the house,
I'm doing something.

59
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:59,222
All right, go ahead.

60
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:02,693
- Yeah?
- It's me. Are you ready to go?

61
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:05,028
No. Come on up.

62
00:03:05,203 --> 00:03:06,830
I can't work with these.

63
00:03:07,371 --> 00:03:11,034
- What's wrong?
- You bought me dishwashing gloves.

64
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:13,643
- There's no fine touch.
- You said "gloves."

65
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,245
No. No, these are too thick.

66
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:19,746
- Is that Home Alone?
- Yeah. The original.

67
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:22,752
- Hey, boys-o.
- Hey!

68
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,821
Hello.

69
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,423
Hey, get your stuff. Let's go.

70
00:03:27,592 --> 00:03:29,492
Wait a minute.
There's a change of plans.

71
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,788
- What?
- Remember Roy, the artist?

72
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:35,831
- Oh, the triangle guy.
- Yeah. Exactly. The triangle guy.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,592
Yeah. You liked him.
What happened?

74
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,464
Yeah, I did. He was very talented.

75
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:43,334
He was just, I don't know,
a little too...

76
00:03:43,508 --> 00:03:46,238
- Artsy?
- Fat.

77
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,310
He was a fat starving artist,
you know?

78
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,071
- That's very rare.
- Yeah.

79
00:03:50,248 --> 00:03:52,739
Anyway, he's in the hospital,
he's having surgery...

80
00:03:52,917 --> 00:03:54,942
...and I should go visit him.
- What's wrong?

81
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:57,679
Something with his spleen.
It'll just take five minutes.

82
00:03:57,855 --> 00:03:59,550
Okay? The hospital's
right on the way.

83
00:03:59,724 --> 00:04:03,023
- All right. We'll wait for you.
- I can get some rubber gloves there.

84
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:06,996
Listen, Jerry, could you
do me a favor?

85
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:09,725
Could you go into the room
with me to visit him?

86
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:13,302
Because I don't want him to think
that I'm, you know, interested.

87
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:15,598
Oh, you want me to pretend
to be your boyfriend.

88
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:18,207
- Well...
- Well, I think I can do that.

89
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:20,901
I've played that role before
to some critical acclaim.

90
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:23,280
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

91
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:24,607
- Yep.
- What's with him?

92
00:04:24,782 --> 00:04:27,012
You know, a lot of people
have asked that.

93
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,493
Roy.

94
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:38,424
Elaine.

95
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:41,087
What a surprise.

96
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:43,495
Oh, my God.

97
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:47,104
I hardly recognize you. You look so...

98
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:51,173
- Yeah, I've lost some weight.
- A lot of weight.

99
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:55,574
- I know.
- You look terrific.

100
00:04:55,746 --> 00:04:58,078
Thank you. So do you.

101
00:05:01,752 --> 00:05:06,121
This is... You really lost weight.

102
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,851
- Thank you.
- Jerry. I'm the boyfriend.

103
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:17,692
Dr. Whittenberg, outside call.

104
00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:20,838
Dr. Whittenberg, outside call.

105
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,677
The mother lode.

106
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:40,622
I can't believe it. You were huge.

107
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:42,884
Like blubber.

108
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,891
I couldn't even get my arms
around you.

109
00:05:45,062 --> 00:05:47,394
Yes. I remember.

110
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:50,090
Well, that's a positive thing
about getting sick.

111
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:54,329
- You get to lose weight.
- Elaine, it wasn't the illness.

112
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:56,564
- It was you.
- Me?

113
00:05:56,741 --> 00:06:00,837
Yeah. After you stopped seeing me,
I was devastated.

114
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:03,071
I couldn't eat for weeks.

115
00:06:03,247 --> 00:06:05,078
Get out!

116
00:06:08,686 --> 00:06:11,587
- Really. It's the truth.
- Jerry, did you hear this?

117
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:14,020
He couldn't eat for weeks.

118
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:16,352
That's terrible.

119
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:21,394
I had no idea I had
that kind of effect on you.

120
00:06:21,565 --> 00:06:23,556
You did.

121
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:27,869
You know, I can't get
this damn thing to sleep.

122
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:30,698
Now, listen, Roy, tell me something:

123
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,935
- When are you getting out of here?
- Next Thursday.

124
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:36,602
Okay, I tell you what.
How about on Friday...

125
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:41,878
...I take you out for a big meal,
because you are getting too thin.

126
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:44,078
Honey...

127
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:51,452
...aren't we going to
the Poconos next Friday?

128
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:54,359
No, that's the week after.

129
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:56,762
No, I believe it's next week.

130
00:06:56,934 --> 00:06:59,198
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.

131
00:07:00,471 --> 00:07:01,995
Shut up.

132
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:06,642
Pay dirt.

133
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,176
Roy, this is Kramer.
He's one of our friends.

134
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,944
- How do you do?
- I do great.

135
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,586
- Hi, Roy.
- Hey, Dr. Siegel.

136
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:21,555
Hey, doc, check this out.

137
00:07:21,726 --> 00:07:24,024
- Hey.
- I just learned that.

138
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:28,629
I just wanted to stop by...

139
00:07:28,799 --> 00:07:31,529
...see if you had any questions
about tomorrow's operation.

140
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:34,500
Yeah, yeah, I have...
I have a question.

141
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:37,641
What do you know about
interabdominal retractors?

142
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:41,005
Are you asking because
you saw 20/20 last night?

143
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:43,146
I sure am.

144
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:47,273
Well, that report was about
one very specific type of retractor.

145
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:52,252
And I can assure you we do not use
that retractor in your friend's procedure.

146
00:07:52,423 --> 00:07:55,586
But you will use a retractor.

147
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,091
We have to.

148
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:09,029
I'll tell you what. You're obviously
concerned about your friend's welfare.

149
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:12,004
A few of my students will be
observing tomorrow's operation...

150
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:15,407
...from the viewing gallery. How would
you like to watch it with them?

151
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,412
- I'd love to watch the operation, yeah.
- I don't know.

152
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,709
Come on, Jerry,
you gotta see the operation.

153
00:08:20,885 --> 00:08:24,150
They're gonna cut him open.
His guts will be all over the place.

154
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:27,019
- Yeah, that's true.
- They'll saw through bone.

155
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:33,093
We'll see what's inside bone.

156
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,698
- Hey.
- Hi.

157
00:08:47,545 --> 00:08:51,481
- What are you doing? You're crying?
- No.

158
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:53,674
You're crying from Home Alone?

159
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:58,380
- The old man got to me.
- All right.

160
00:08:58,556 --> 00:09:01,116
Get yourself together.
I don't know if I can be friends...

161
00:09:01,292 --> 00:09:04,455
...with you anymore after this display.
- Oh, shut up.

162
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:09,532
What are you doing back
so soon, anyway?

163
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,168
I never even got to the gym.
Kramer got the gloves...

164
00:09:12,336 --> 00:09:15,032
...wanted to come home
and start working on his floor.

165
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:17,174
- How's the guy?
- He's okay.

166
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:19,536
In fact, him and Elaine
are getting pretty chummy.

167
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,678
Now Elaine wants me to buy
some of his art.

168
00:09:21,846 --> 00:09:24,474
- That's nerve.
- Yeah. So she and triangle boy...

169
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,673
...can go out to fancy restaurants.

170
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:29,283
You know what it is?

171
00:09:29,453 --> 00:09:31,318
It's Clara Nightingale Syndrome.

172
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:34,549
- He falls ill, she falls in love.
- You mean Florence Nightingale.

173
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:37,956
- What did I say, "Clara"?
- You must have meant Clara Barton.

174
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:42,031
Clara Barton? What did she do?

175
00:09:42,867 --> 00:09:46,325
I'm not sure,
but I think she was nice.

176
00:09:47,505 --> 00:09:50,235
Susan B. Anthony I think
I'd have a problem with.

177
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:53,069
Yeah, I think you would.

178
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:54,643
So are you gonna buy his art?

179
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:56,905
No. Why don't you buy it.
You got $ 1900.

180
00:09:57,081 --> 00:09:59,515
Yeah. That's what I want. Triangles.

181
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,810
I'm out of here.
Have fun with whatshername.

182
00:10:01,986 --> 00:10:03,510
I will.

183
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,554
You know, now you gotta ask her
her name. It's so embarrassing.

184
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:10,125
- No, it isn't. I can find out.
- Yeah? How?

185
00:10:10,294 --> 00:10:11,761
There are ways.

186
00:10:12,963 --> 00:10:15,227
You know, I remember
when I was a kid growing up...

187
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,163
...kids would make fun of my name
like you wouldn't believe.

188
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:21,270
"Jerry, Jerry, Dingleberry" and...

189
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:23,998
..."Seinsmelled."
- Seinsmelled?

190
00:10:24,175 --> 00:10:25,733
Yeah.

191
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,242
What about you? Did people
make fun of your name?

192
00:10:28,412 --> 00:10:30,778
Are you kidding?
They were merciless.

193
00:10:30,948 --> 00:10:32,848
What do you expect
when your name rhymes...

194
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:35,508
...with a part of the female anatomy?

195
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,852
Of course, not everybody can be
as sweet as you are.

196
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:54,170
- Oh, Jerry.
- Oh, you.

197
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:59,273
Now, let's try "breast."

198
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,041
Celeste.

199
00:11:05,216 --> 00:11:07,616
- Kest.
- No.

200
00:11:07,785 --> 00:11:12,620
- Rest. Sest. Hest.
- Hest?

201
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,348
That's not a name.

202
00:11:14,525 --> 00:11:17,221
- You should have just asked her.
- I know I should have asked.

203
00:11:17,394 --> 00:11:20,192
- What are you gonna do now?
- I don't know. I can't ask her now.

204
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:22,389
I've already made out with her.

205
00:11:22,566 --> 00:11:25,330
Once you make out with a woman,
you can't ask her her name.

206
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:27,265
Aretha.

207
00:11:30,007 --> 00:11:32,032
No.

208
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:35,701
- Bovary.
- All right, that's enough.

209
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,947
You know what you gotta do?
You gotta go through her purse.

210
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,674
The credit cards, driver's license.

211
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:44,343
- Well, how am I gonna do that?
- When she goes to the bathroom.

212
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:46,519
- There you are.
- Hey.

213
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,180
My date stood me up.

214
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:51,192
Listen, will you guys go
to the operation with me?

215
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:55,158
You asked a date
to go to the operation?

216
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:56,629
Yeah.

217
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,131
So come on. What do you say?

218
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:01,928
- What kind of operation is it?
- Splenectomy.

219
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:04,472
- Isn't that where they remove the...?
- Don't ruin it.

220
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:06,576
I haven't seen it yet.

221
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,610
Now, come on. What do you say?

222
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:10,440
Mulva.

223
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:14,876
Mulva?

224
00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:17,043
Come on, come on. You wanna go?

225
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:18,882
- Come on. Yeah.
- All right. All right.

226
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:20,853
Just let me finish my coffee.

227
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:24,483
Then we'll watch them go
slice this fat bastard up.

228
00:12:27,464 --> 00:12:30,661
Now we'll open
the peritoneal cavity...

229
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:33,564
...exposing the body's
internal organs.

230
00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:36,702
Nurse, retractor.

231
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:48,711
- What are you eating?
- Junior Mints.

232
00:12:48,886 --> 00:12:50,786
- You want one?
- No.

233
00:12:50,954 --> 00:12:52,945
Now, I can't see.

234
00:12:57,761 --> 00:12:59,661
Could you get...?

235
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:12,399
Where'd you get those?

236
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:14,066
- The machine. You want one?
- No.

237
00:13:14,244 --> 00:13:16,007
- Here. Take one.
- I don't want one.

238
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,807
- No, they're good.
- I don't want any.

239
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:21,041
- Just take one.
- No. Stop... Kramer, stop it.

240
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:38,557
- Did it go in?
- Yes.

241
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:46,671
Over the balcony, bounced off
some respirator thing...

242
00:13:46,844 --> 00:13:48,607
...into the patient.

243
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:52,740
What do you mean,
"Into the patient"?

244
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,077
Into the patient. Literally.

245
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:58,085
- Into the hole?
- Yes.

246
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,984
The hole.

247
00:14:00,157 --> 00:14:01,920
- Didn't they notice it?
- No.

248
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:05,755
- How could they not notice it?
- Because it's a little mint.

249
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,056
It's a Junior Mint.

250
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:13,231
Well, what did they do?

251
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:15,770
They sealed him up
with the mint inside.

252
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,568
- They left the Junior Mint in him?
- Yes.

253
00:14:20,778 --> 00:14:23,576
Well, l... I guess it can't hurt him.

254
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:25,408
People eat pounds of those things.

255
00:14:25,582 --> 00:14:27,015
Yes, they eat them.

256
00:14:27,184 --> 00:14:32,281
They don't put them next to vital
organs in their abdominal cavity.

257
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:36,655
- Yeah.
- It's me.

258
00:14:36,827 --> 00:14:38,226
Come on up.

259
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:39,885
Hey.

260
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:42,930
This wallpaper is very good.

261
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,193
My place looks like a ski lodge.

262
00:14:45,369 --> 00:14:47,997
Why'd you force that mint on me?
I didn't want the mint!

263
00:14:48,172 --> 00:14:50,470
- What? I didn't believe you.
- How could you not?

264
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:53,337
Well, who's gonna turn down
a Junior Mint?

265
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,877
It's chocolate, it's peppermint.
It's delicious.

266
00:14:58,282 --> 00:15:01,479
- That's true.
- It's very refreshing.

267
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:05,019
Well, just don't say anything
about this to Elaine.

268
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:09,082
Prognosis...

269
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:11,056
...negative.

270
00:15:11,228 --> 00:15:13,321
Prognosis negative?

271
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:15,931
He's not doing well.
The doctors don't know what it is.

272
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:17,964
They're baffled.

273
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:20,160
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

274
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:23,898
Just my luck, you know? Just when
he was getting thin and attractive.

275
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:26,773
You know, Jerry, you should
buy some of his art.

276
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:31,074
- That would really lift his spirits.
- It's that bleak?

277
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,176
You know, if the guy dies...

278
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,844
...the art could really be
worth something.

279
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:40,250
- We gotta confess.
- Really?

280
00:15:40,424 --> 00:15:42,016
- Yes.
- We could be tried for murder.

281
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,558
I can't have this on my conscience.
We're Leopold and Loeb.

282
00:15:44,728 --> 00:15:46,923
- You're not saying anything.
- You can't stop me.

283
00:15:47,264 --> 00:15:49,255
No, you're not!

284
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:54,494
Hey, Elaine, put me down
for some of that art.

285
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:56,832
Nineteen hundred dollars' worth.

286
00:16:00,744 --> 00:16:03,110
Yeah, that's the spot.

287
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,872
What are you so tense about?

288
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:08,381
Nothing, really. Just a homicide.

289
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,522
That's terrific...

290
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:15,185
...Mulva.

291
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,593
What?

292
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:27,234
Mulva?

293
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:29,939
Mulva?

294
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:31,369
My...

295
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:34,477
My aunt's name is Mulva.
She's a masseuse.

296
00:16:35,546 --> 00:16:37,605
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

297
00:16:37,781 --> 00:16:39,612
Good idea.

298
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,756
What are you doing?

299
00:16:51,495 --> 00:16:54,020
I was just looking for some gum.

300
00:16:54,197 --> 00:16:55,994
- Or a mint.
- I have Junior Mints.

301
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,895
No! No. I mean...

302
00:16:58,268 --> 00:17:00,566
No, thank you. No.

303
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:07,109
- Any news?
- No. No. You better get out of here.

304
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:09,006
No, wait a sec. Wait a second.

305
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:11,611
I don't know the name of
this woman in the bathroom.

306
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,875
So when she comes out,
you introduce yourself.

307
00:17:14,051 --> 00:17:16,042
- She'll be forced to say her name.
- Ten-four.

308
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:17,982
Okay.

309
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:21,155
- Hello.
- Hello, I'm Kramer.

310
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:24,317
- Nice to meet you.
- See you later.

311
00:17:26,663 --> 00:17:29,188
I'd better get going.
I don't wanna be late for the play.

312
00:17:29,366 --> 00:17:31,027
- Okay.
- My cousin knows the producer.

313
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:33,669
I may get to go backstage
and meet Olympia Dukakis.

314
00:17:33,837 --> 00:17:35,896
- There's a name you don't forget.
- Bye, Jerry.

315
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:37,563
Bye.

316
00:17:39,376 --> 00:17:41,207
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm George.

317
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:45,280
- Nice to meet you, George.
- Yeah. I gave it a shot.

318
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,281
So any word on the artiste?

319
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:51,045
No. I haven't heard anything.

320
00:17:51,221 --> 00:17:53,348
- Well, I got my triangles.
- Really?

321
00:17:53,523 --> 00:17:56,014
Yep. You know, they really
spruce up the apartment.

322
00:17:56,193 --> 00:17:59,993
Yeah, I'm sure. I gotta call the hospital.
I gotta tell them what happened.

323
00:18:00,297 --> 00:18:02,197
- No, no. Jerry, I wouldn't do that.
- Why?

324
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:03,833
You could get in trouble.

325
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:05,730
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.

326
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:08,393
Who are you to play God?!

327
00:18:08,572 --> 00:18:10,335
Every man's time comes.

328
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,566
If his number is up,
who are you to interfere?

329
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:15,109
Yes, I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel.

330
00:18:15,278 --> 00:18:17,337
It's about Roy Corning's condition.

331
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:19,607
- What? What?
- That's fantastic.

332
00:18:19,783 --> 00:18:23,844
- He didn't get better, did he?
- Thank you very much. Okay. Bye-bye.

333
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:26,148
He's gonna be okay.

334
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:29,958
Where's the luck?

335
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:32,652
There's no luck.

336
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:35,992
Nineteen hundred dollars
down the drain.

337
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:40,197
You saved my life, George.

338
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,668
You buying my art is what
inspired me to get better.

339
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,773
I'll never forget what you did for me.

340
00:18:44,941 --> 00:18:46,875
Well, that's great. It's really great.

341
00:18:47,844 --> 00:18:49,402
You know, art's a great investment.

342
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:51,171
They'll be great in your apartment.

343
00:18:51,348 --> 00:18:54,112
Yes, I look forward
to many years of...

344
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:57,082
...looking at the triangles.

345
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,888
Well, I'll... I'll wait for you outside.

346
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:04,425
- Hey, George.
- Yeah?

347
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,624
- All right.
- That's nice.

348
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:09,322
Thanks, Roy.

349
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:12,300
Hey.

350
00:19:12,469 --> 00:19:15,267
There's the guy who saved my life.

351
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:18,135
You know, I don't want
to totally discount...

352
00:19:18,308 --> 00:19:21,209
...the emotional element
in your recovery...

353
00:19:21,378 --> 00:19:24,472
...but I think there were
other factors at play here.

354
00:19:24,648 --> 00:19:27,082
- What do you mean?
- I have no medical evidence...

355
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,550
...to back me up, but something
happened during the operation...

356
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:34,282
...that staved off that infection.

357
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:37,086
Something beyond science.

358
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,228
Something perhaps...

359
00:19:39,396 --> 00:19:41,125
...from above.

360
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,166
Mint?

361
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:47,633
Those can be very refreshing.

362
00:19:52,075 --> 00:19:54,202
So Elaine...

363
00:19:54,377 --> 00:19:57,540
...where we going for our
big dinner on Friday?

364
00:19:59,716 --> 00:20:00,910
I'm so sorry, Roy...

365
00:20:01,084 --> 00:20:04,451
...but, actually, we are going to
the Poconos on Friday. Right, honey?

366
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:06,752
I don't think so.

367
00:20:06,923 --> 00:20:09,414
Yeah, I believe that we...
We are.

368
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:11,322
I believe we're not.

369
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,356
- Please, can we go to the Poconos?
- Well, I'll think about it.

370
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:20,392
Great seats. You could see
the actors spitting.

371
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,798
Really.

372
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,304
Afterwards, we went backstage,
and Olympia Dukakis...

373
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,702
...autographed my playbill.

374
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,274
- Wait a second. You got her autograph?
- Yeah.

375
00:20:29,446 --> 00:20:32,506
- Do you have it with you?
- Yeah, it's in my purse.

376
00:20:32,682 --> 00:20:34,843
Let me see.

377
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:38,818
You know, I really think I'm
falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld.

378
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:42,720
Well, I really think
I'm falling for you...

379
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:45,384
..."Joseph Poglia."

380
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:50,130
I had it autographed for my uncle.

381
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,962
Yeah, I know.

382
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:55,730
You don't know my name, do you?

383
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:59,302
- Yes, I do.
- What is it?

384
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:02,674
It rhymes with a female body part.

385
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:04,874
What is it?

386
00:21:06,249 --> 00:21:08,217
Mulva?

387
00:21:12,222 --> 00:21:13,985
Gipple?

388
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,054
Loleola?

389
00:21:31,341 --> 00:21:33,866
Dolores!

390
00:21:42,285 --> 00:21:46,915
Ages 0 through 10, candy is
your life. There's nothing else.

391
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,388
Family, friends, school,
they're only obstacles...

392
00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:51,823
...in the way of getting more candy.

393
00:21:51,995 --> 00:21:53,986
You have your favorite candies
that you love.

394
00:21:54,164 --> 00:21:56,428
You know, "I love those. I hate those.

395
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,795
I hate those. I love those."

396
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:01,563
Only a 7-year-old kid can actually
taste the difference...

397
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:05,003
...between, like, a red M&M
and a light-brown M&M.

398
00:22:05,175 --> 00:22:08,110
That's two totally different things
when you're a 7-year-old.

399
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:10,439
"Well, your red is more of
a main-course M&M...

400
00:22:10,614 --> 00:22:12,912
...but the brown, it's a more
of a mellower flavor.

401
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:16,052
It's an after-dinner M&M, really."
