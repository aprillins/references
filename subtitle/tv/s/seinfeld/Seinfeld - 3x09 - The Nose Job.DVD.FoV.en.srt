1
00:00:04,903 --> 00:00:07,238
Give me an explanation
why the pharmacist has to be...

2
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:10,660
...two and a half feet up
above everybody else.

3
00:00:11,015 --> 00:00:14,627
What the hell is he doing he can't be
on the floor with you and me?

4
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:18,500
Brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear
physicists, we're on the same level.

5
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:21,888
Oh, no, he's gotta be
two and a half feet up.

6
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:25,403
''Look out, everybody,
I'm working with pills.

7
00:00:25,702 --> 00:00:27,644
Spread out, give me some room.''

8
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,784
The only hard part of his whole job
that I could see...

9
00:00:30,982 --> 00:00:33,699
...is typing everything
onto that little, tiny label.

10
00:00:34,214 --> 00:00:36,767
And has to try and get
all the words on there...

11
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:40,349
...keep the little piece of paper
in the roller of the typewriter.

12
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:43,485
Oh, no. He's gotta be
two and a half feet up.

13
00:00:43,654 --> 00:00:47,745
''Yeah, I'd like to get this
prescription filled.''

14
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,259
''All right. You wait down there.

15
00:00:51,557 --> 00:00:53,150
Only I'm allowed up here.''

16
00:00:59,493 --> 00:01:01,664
-Where'd you meet her?
-I met her on an elevator.

17
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:04,545
On an elevator?
You met a woman on an elevator?

18
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,458
-Impossible, right?
-You got less than 60 seconds.

19
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,987
That's like dismantling a time bomb.

20
00:01:10,372 --> 00:01:12,990
-What got into you?
-I don't know. She was so beautiful...

21
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,880
...it was a pure reflex. The words...

22
00:01:15,044 --> 00:01:17,858
-...just came out of my mouth.
-Wow. What did you say?

23
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:23,132
You know, I'm the one responsible
for those crop circles in England.

24
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:27,711
-Can you believe I did that?
-What did she say?

25
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:29,883
What crop circles?

26
00:01:31,652 --> 00:01:33,921
-Not a good sign.
-Not everybody knows...

27
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:37,083
...what the crop circles are.
You know what the crop circles are?

28
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:39,291
Crop circles?
Why don't you buy something?

29
00:01:39,748 --> 00:01:41,209
You got something in your teeth.

30
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,391
-What?
-It's green.

31
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:47,548
Oh, man, spinach. I've been
walking around like this all afternoon.

32
00:01:47,715 --> 00:01:51,359
-You bump into anybody you knew?
-I had a job interview.

33
00:01:51,747 --> 00:01:54,048
-How did it go?
-Take a guess.

34
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,244
Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing
available at the present time...

35
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,582
...but should anything open up,
we'll be in touch.

36
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:01,791
Okay, thanks.

37
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,572
You don't need a job.
You got Audrey.

38
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:06,494
Yeah. Right.

39
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:09,144
-What's the matter?
-No. Nothing.

40
00:02:09,826 --> 00:02:11,898
-What?
-You won't think I'm a bad person?

41
00:02:12,226 --> 00:02:13,687
Too late for that.

42
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:17,632
Because, believe me, I would only say
this to you and maybe a psychiatrist.

43
00:02:17,986 --> 00:02:19,512
What is it?

44
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,110
Well....

45
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:24,510
Her nose is a little big.

46
00:02:26,145 --> 00:02:27,454
Yeah, she's got a big nose.

47
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:30,944
I mean, big would even be okay.

48
00:02:31,488 --> 00:02:32,699
It's beyond big.

49
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:35,933
It's a schnoz.

50
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:38,646
I'm aware that my own
physical dimensions...

51
00:02:38,816 --> 00:02:41,467
-...are a little short of perfection.
-A little.

52
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:43,868
Who am I to be thinking
about someone's nose?

53
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:48,091
I should be grateful someone like her
looks at me. I have no job, nothing.

54
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:50,556
But I have to say,
I think about the nose.

55
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:54,650
I don't wanna think about it, I don't ask
to think about it, but I think about it.

56
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,776
I go to bed, I tell myself, ''Don't
think about the nose.'' I think about it.

57
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:01,877
I look at her, I see the nose.

58
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,150
Stop being so concerned with looks.

59
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:16,249
-Have you said anything to her?
-No. Could never do that.

60
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:18,455
The ironic thing is,
if she had a smaller nose...

61
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:22,714
...I never could've dated her. She'd be
out of my league with a smaller nose.

62
00:03:23,263 --> 00:03:26,263
And I really like her. I know that.

63
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:28,372
And I know one other thing:

64
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:30,902
I'm not getting past that nose.

65
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,104
All right, shut up. Here they come.

66
00:03:34,718 --> 00:03:37,304
How can I not think about it?
Look at the size of this thing.

67
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:43,225
My mother's going out with this guy
who leaves a jacket in her house.

68
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,513
She gives to me. Well, two years later,
he shows up and takes it back.

69
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:51,383
Now he's in prison.
Got arrested for mail fraud.

70
00:03:51,837 --> 00:03:56,344
So, Elaine, go over to the apartment,
tell the landlord you're his daughter...

71
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,265
...and you wanna bring him
the jacket.

72
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:00,917
Won't the landlord know
I'm not the daughter?

73
00:04:01,085 --> 00:04:03,474
No, he's never met her.
She's in California.

74
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:07,922
-Are you coming with me?
-Yeah, I have to. I'm your fiancÃ©.

75
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,893
Peter Von Nostrand.

76
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:14,100
Why don't you just
commit yourself already?

77
00:04:15,357 --> 00:04:16,982
What is so special
about this jacket?

78
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:19,352
-No, you don't wanna know.
-God....

79
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:23,477
He believes it possesses some
extraordinary power over women.

80
00:04:23,644 --> 00:04:25,368
What's that splotch on your hand?

81
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,379
I got stamped at the
reggae lounge last night.

82
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,856
I'm going back there tonight. I'm not
gonna pay another cover charge.

83
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:34,585
You didn't wash all day?

84
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:37,941
Yeah, I washed. Just not the hand.

85
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,555
You wouldn't believe the women
at this club. Man.

86
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:45,560
It's amazing how many
beautiful women live in New York.

87
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:47,610
I actually find it kind of intimidating.

88
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:50,520
You're as pretty as any of them.
Just need a nose job.

89
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:59,444
-Kramer!
-What? What?

90
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:01,683
How could you say
something like that?

91
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,119
What do you mean?
I just said she needs a nose job.

92
00:05:04,282 --> 00:05:07,064
No, no. There's nothing wrong
with her nose.

93
00:05:07,226 --> 00:05:09,943
-God, I'm so sorry, Audrey.
-Oh, it's okay.

94
00:05:10,106 --> 00:05:13,368
-What did you have to say that for?
-I was just trying to help out.

95
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:18,326
Yeah, well, you can kiss that jacket
goodbye, Mr. Von Nausen.

96
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:22,258
You see what happens
when you try to be nice?

97
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:25,809
But what would the world be like...

98
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,148
...if people said whatever
they were thinking...

99
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:30,964
...all the time,
whenever it came to them?

100
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,355
How long would a blind date last?

101
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:36,431
About 1 3 seconds, I think.

102
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:39,574
''Sorry, your rear end is too big.''
''Okay, your breath stinks.''

103
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:42,704
''See you later. No problem. Goodbye.''
''Okay, thank you very much.''

104
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:46,168
Elaine said I can stay with her
another month till Tina gets back.

105
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:48,557
What are you thinking about?

106
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:51,188
Thinking? Nothing.

107
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:53,524
What could I possibly be thinking?

108
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:56,367
You look like you've got something
on your mind.

109
00:05:56,536 --> 00:06:00,431
Yeah, right. I wish I had
something on my mind.

110
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:06,678
So how about that Kramer?

111
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:09,199
Yeah, how about him?

112
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:13,012
-The way he just says stuff.
-He sure does.

113
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:14,964
Yeah, yeah.

114
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:17,806
Yeah, he's quite a character.

115
00:06:18,775 --> 00:06:20,880
So, what did you think?

116
00:06:21,271 --> 00:06:22,612
About the pizza?

117
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:25,491
No. About the nose job.

118
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:29,266
Oh, the nose job. Yeah....

119
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:30,965
I don't know. I--

120
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:35,284
-Well, what did you think?
-Well, I've thought about it...

121
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:38,193
-...but I don't know.
-Yeah.

122
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:43,281
You know, not that I care
one way or the other...

123
00:06:43,447 --> 00:06:47,156
...but these doctors today do amazing
things. lf you were so inclined.

124
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,757
-And again, I'm not suggesting.
-I know. They're good.

125
00:06:51,926 --> 00:06:53,519
Peter Jennings had one.

126
00:06:53,686 --> 00:06:55,758
-Really?
-Probably. They all do.

127
00:06:55,926 --> 00:06:58,861
In my high school,
half my graduating class had them.

128
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:01,298
Of course,
I'm from Long Island, so....

129
00:07:05,205 --> 00:07:07,442
It's really nothing.
It's like going to the dentist.

130
00:07:08,181 --> 00:07:11,377
-I hate the dentist.
-It's a cleaning.

131
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,799
So you really think I should do this.

132
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:19,437
lf it makes you happy.
I don't focus on these things.

133
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:22,928
I will tell you this, though.

134
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:26,060
Unfortunately...

135
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:28,814
...we live in a very
superficial society.

136
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:31,694
I don't condone it...

137
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:33,998
...but it's a fact of life.

138
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:37,170
Well, maybe I should.

139
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:40,750
-What the hell?
-Now you talked her into a nose job?

140
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:43,915
-Me? I didn't say anything.
-You encouraged her to get one.

141
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,800
-I didn't encourage. No encourage.
-''Peter Jennings had one''?

142
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,718
It's possible.

143
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,360
-You should accept her for who she is.
-No, George is right.

144
00:07:52,531 --> 00:07:54,833
-I wanna get one.
-I think it's a mistake.

145
00:07:54,995 --> 00:07:56,588
Me too. Really.

146
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,922
Unless you'd really like one, then....

147
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:04,945
I'm going straight to hell.

148
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:07,309
No two ways about it.

149
00:08:07,474 --> 00:08:10,125
It might not be hell,
but you're gonna run into bad dudes.

150
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:14,641
Get the check.
She takes the bandages off at 4:00.

151
00:08:14,802 --> 00:08:16,395
We have time.

152
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:19,401
It's exciting.
She's gonna have a new face.

153
00:08:19,922 --> 00:08:23,435
-It is exciting.
-Not as exciting as Miss Crop Circles.

154
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:26,960
Please, please. Isabel?

155
00:08:27,122 --> 00:08:30,351
She is the most despicable woman
I have ever met in my life.

156
00:08:30,513 --> 00:08:34,157
I have never been so repulsed
by someone mentally...

157
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:37,834
...and so attracted to them physically
at the same time.

158
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:41,514
It's like my brain is facing my penis
in a chess game.

159
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:47,787
And I'm letting him win.

160
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:50,794
You're not letting him win.
He wins till you're 40.

161
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:54,409
-Then what?
-He still wins, but it's not a blowout.

162
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,022
She wants to be an actress.

163
00:08:58,193 --> 00:09:01,935
She makes me read these moronic
acting scenes with her, and I do it.

164
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:06,795
Because I'm so addicted to the sex,
I'm helpless. I'll do anything.

165
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:09,227
So, finally, Kramer comes in
the other day.

166
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,688
I don't want to see this woman
anymore...

167
00:09:11,856 --> 00:09:14,343
...but I haven't got the willpower
to throw out her number.

168
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,138
Please help me.

169
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:18,350
Help me.

170
00:09:23,056 --> 00:09:24,266
I'm proud of you.

171
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:29,548
So I'm never gonna see her again.
I'm going cold turkey.

172
00:09:29,711 --> 00:09:31,020
Good for you.

173
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:34,951
I'll tell you, the sex....

174
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,788
I was like an animal.

175
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,030
I mean, it was just
completely uninhibited.

176
00:09:41,966 --> 00:09:46,341
It's like going to the bathroom in front
of a lot of people, and not caring.

177
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,707
It's not like that at all.

178
00:09:57,102 --> 00:09:59,077
How do you even know
the jacket is there?

179
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:01,227
Well, I don't. I'm guessing.

180
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:04,717
Okay, look, Audrey,
before you take the bandage off...

181
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:07,981
...just remember, I was the one
that encouraged you to do this.

182
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:11,851
Now that you're gonna be a great
beauty, let's not forget how this began.

183
00:10:12,014 --> 00:10:14,283
-lf you listened to your friend Elaine--
-George.

184
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:15,979
-Yeah?
-Enough.

185
00:10:16,141 --> 00:10:17,548
-Right, enough.
-Are we ready?

186
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:19,498
Come on,
let's get this show on the road.

187
00:10:19,693 --> 00:10:22,082
-You sure you want us here for this?
-Yes.

188
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,708
-Shouldn't a doctor do it?
-No, he said I could do it.

189
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:27,592
Okay, here goes.

190
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:31,269
This is very exciting. Very exciting.
It's like watching a birth.

191
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:37,672
It looks good.

192
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:41,123
-Great job.
-You got butchered.

193
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:50,179
Head hurt.
No, I'm good. I'm fine.

194
00:10:50,412 --> 00:10:52,299
Let's put him over here.

195
00:10:53,355 --> 00:10:55,428
-Where are you going?
-To that doctor.

196
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,482
Wait, wait, wait! I'll go with you.

197
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:08,711
How you feeling?

198
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:12,293
Too much salt in my diet.

199
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:15,432
-Can I get you anything?
-I'm good.

200
00:11:15,915 --> 00:11:18,151
You sure? Anything.

201
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:21,631
No.

202
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:27,488
Boy, it really didn't come out
too well, did it?

203
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:31,070
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.

204
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,577
It's, like, all dented.

205
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:36,837
Seems to be.

206
00:11:39,402 --> 00:11:41,409
Well, I'm sure
they'll be able to fix it.

207
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:46,344
You can't stop modern science.
Can't stop it. Can't stop science.

208
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,374
Can't be stopped. No way, no how.
Science just marches--

209
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:51,487
Shut up, George.

210
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:55,716
-Shut up?
-Yeah.

211
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:59,361
Interesting.

212
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:04,223
Come on, Kramer.
Seriously, give me her number!

213
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:05,919
-I threw it out.
-You're lying.

214
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:08,260
-You've got it. I want the number.
-I threw it out.

215
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:10,431
-Give it to me.
-You said not to.

216
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,185
-You made me promise.
-I changed my mind. I want it.

217
00:12:13,352 --> 00:12:15,239
You said no matter what,
I'm not to give it to you.

218
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,472
-I was lying. Give it to me.
-You told me not to.

219
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,454
-I want the number!
-All right! You want it? Yeah!

220
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,906
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah.
Yeah, look at you.

221
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:26,109
Look at what you've sunk to.

222
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,588
Look at what you've become.

223
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,781
Look in the mirror, because you
need help, Jerry. You need help.

224
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:34,980
Because I can't stand by and do it
anymore. It's turning my stomach.

225
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:38,439
I can't stand around here
watching you destroy yourself!

226
00:12:38,599 --> 00:12:40,868
It's eating me up inside!

227
00:12:51,942 --> 00:12:56,895
The doctor said they need to build the
lateral wall of the septum. Over here.

228
00:12:57,094 --> 00:12:58,304
Yeah.

229
00:12:58,502 --> 00:13:01,152
-You see this paranasal sinus cavity?
-Oh, I got it.

230
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:05,693
See how it's collapsed?
That's what's causing this huge dent.

231
00:13:05,862 --> 00:13:08,131
Yeah. Rough, rough.

232
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:11,389
So anyway, you know what
I was thinking about?

233
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:13,151
What?

234
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:16,067
Remember we talked
about taking a trip together?

235
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:20,352
-We did?
-We talked about going to Hawaii.

236
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,909
-Hawaii?
-Anyway, I think it would be great...

237
00:13:23,077 --> 00:13:25,565
...to get away after all this.

238
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,587
Well, you--

239
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:32,099
You know, Hawaii could be
a little tricky now.

240
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:34,944
There's high-pressure winds
down there this time of year.

241
00:13:35,109 --> 00:13:38,109
There's a lot of debris
constantly flying around, a lot of...

242
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,316
...wood and lava.

243
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:42,171
It could be dangerous.

244
00:13:42,372 --> 00:13:45,787
-I never heard that.
-Oh, yeah. My friend lived there, so....

245
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,571
We could go to the Caribbean.

246
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:52,473
I have to tell you something.
You couldn't get me on a plane now.

247
00:13:52,772 --> 00:13:54,659
I get those FAA reports directly.

248
00:13:54,852 --> 00:13:57,699
My uncle sends them to me.
He used to be a pilot, so....

249
00:13:58,211 --> 00:13:59,902
Big investigation in the....

250
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,955
What's the word there?
Offing. It's in the offing.

251
00:14:05,284 --> 00:14:10,619
But you shouldn't let that stop you
from going. You could go. I don't mind.

252
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:13,410
-George?
-Yeah.

253
00:14:13,731 --> 00:14:15,803
I don't think this is working.

254
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:21,787
Ever since you came back from
the Army, you've changed.

255
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:27,135
I swear, Nelson, I don't even know
who you are anymore.

256
00:14:27,363 --> 00:14:29,337
I'm Nelson.

257
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:34,172
-That's not the line, Jerry.
-All right, all right, I'm sorry.

258
00:14:35,426 --> 00:14:39,452
Nothing's changed, Elma.
I just need more time.

259
00:14:40,994 --> 00:14:45,150
I swear, Nelson, sometimes at
night when you're not around...

260
00:14:45,921 --> 00:14:49,336
...I just go crazy thinking
about you.

261
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:51,223
Well, you just need to relax.

262
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:54,651
Maybe a hobby. Bowling is fun.

263
00:14:55,713 --> 00:14:59,258
Yeah, bowling's good,
if you're really gross and ugly.

264
00:14:59,937 --> 00:15:02,304
<i>Uh-oh. My organs</i>
<i>are playing chess again.

265
00:15:02,465 --> 00:15:06,294
I'm getting tired of this. What do you
say we play one for all the marbles?

266
00:15:06,465 --> 00:15:09,847
Oh, brain, what are you doing?
You cannot beat me.

267
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:13,365
Do you have any idea who you're
dealing with? Forget about it.

268
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,966
I can't take her anymore.

269
00:15:15,136 --> 00:15:18,649
-I hate reading her little acting scenes.
-Oh, so what?

270
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:20,507
So you read from a little play.

271
00:15:20,672 --> 00:15:24,020
You can't put up with that for an hour
to make me happy? You're so selfish.

272
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:25,785
Give me one hour.

273
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,022
Then I will take over. You won't
have to think for the rest of the night.

274
00:15:29,184 --> 00:15:30,558
What about tomorrow morning?

275
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,135
Do you have any idea what
that's like for me? Do you care?

276
00:15:34,304 --> 00:15:35,733
No, you don't care.

277
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:39,351
So long as you get to do
whatever it is you do.

278
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,940
-You disgust me.
-Oh, go read a book.

279
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:44,980
Enough chatter. Let's play.

280
00:15:45,823 --> 00:15:48,671
I'm only doing this because
you took Audrey to the hospital.

281
00:15:48,895 --> 00:15:52,091
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, now, you're clear?
You got everything?

282
00:15:52,254 --> 00:15:53,749
-Yeah.
-Wait, wait, wait.

283
00:15:55,326 --> 00:15:56,570
Here.

284
00:15:56,991 --> 00:16:00,220
-What do I need this for?
-Because we're engaged.

285
00:16:00,894 --> 00:16:02,934
We're engaged?

286
00:16:03,326 --> 00:16:04,984
Kramer, this is too big.

287
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,667
-It's my mom's.
-Hello!

288
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:13,107
Oh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper.
I'm Albert Pepper's daughter.

289
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:15,765
My father asked me to pick up
his jacket for him.

290
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:18,170
Hello, Miss Pepper.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

291
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:20,634
And you must be
Professor Von Nostrand.

292
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:22,007
Yes. Yes, I am.

293
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,262
I've read your book, professor,
and I was quite intrigued by it.

294
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,597
-Yes, well, it's very intriguing.
-Tell me...

295
00:16:29,757 --> 00:16:32,888
...is it your contention that
Shakespeare was an imposter?

296
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:34,460
-My contention?
-Your contention.

297
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:37,621
-Well, yes, that's my contention.
-I heard him contend that.

298
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:39,804
It's too bad about your father.

299
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:43,543
-It was a frame-up.
-A fine man. He spoke often of you.

300
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,945
He's very proud of the work
you're doing.

301
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:49,944
-We're all proud of the work I'm doing.
-Yes, she does fine work.

302
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:54,450
Your father gave me strict orders
not to turn the jacket over to anyone...

303
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,173
...but I suppose I can make
an exception in your case.

304
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,412
-The closet's this way.
-How kind of you.

305
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,610
You know, your father has a very
extensive wardrobe.

306
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:04,372
Yes.

307
00:17:08,572 --> 00:17:10,960
What's the matter, fella?
You look a little tired.

308
00:17:11,899 --> 00:17:13,841
Nelson, don't you see?

309
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:17,430
You are a part of me.

310
00:17:18,139 --> 00:17:19,829
And l....

311
00:17:20,443 --> 00:17:22,931
I am a part of you.

312
00:17:23,675 --> 00:17:25,049
She's killing me.

313
00:17:31,322 --> 00:17:32,696
That's your move?

314
00:17:32,858 --> 00:17:35,509
-Yeah.
-Well, that's trouble, my friend.

315
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:37,430
That's big trouble.

316
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:39,064
Checkmate.

317
00:17:41,658 --> 00:17:44,211
Getting weak. Losing power.

318
00:17:44,922 --> 00:17:48,085
You haven't seen the last of me.
I'll be back.

319
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,181
You're nothing without me.
Nothing.

320
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:55,925
Little punk.

321
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:01,589
Isabel, I don't think this is working.

322
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:08,149
Daddy certainly does have
an extensive wardrobe.

323
00:18:08,313 --> 00:18:13,014
He is a fine dresser. I don't have to tell
you he's quite popular with the ladies.

324
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:16,589
My father? Really? I had no idea.

325
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,004
They're crazy about him.

326
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:21,484
One in particular came around
about two years ago.

327
00:18:22,072 --> 00:18:24,789
Looked a lot like you, professor.
Could have been your mother.

328
00:18:25,177 --> 00:18:27,348
What was her name again?

329
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:30,003
Carter? Kramer. That's it.

330
00:18:30,264 --> 00:18:33,363
Babs Kramer. Nasty woman.

331
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:35,666
Many a night I had to
throw her on the street...

332
00:18:35,832 --> 00:18:38,221
-...drunken stumblebum.
-You don't say.

333
00:18:38,392 --> 00:18:41,621
-I found it!
-She walked around here half-naked...

334
00:18:41,784 --> 00:18:44,947
...sucking Colt 45 from a can.

335
00:18:45,111 --> 00:18:49,006
Her big, fat stomach hanging out,
orthopedic hose up to her knees...

336
00:18:49,176 --> 00:18:50,899
...screaming down the hall:

337
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,812
''Come back to bed, Albert,
you big hairy ape!

338
00:18:53,975 --> 00:18:57,587
And bring back that box of Danish!''

339
00:18:59,063 --> 00:19:01,681
-So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
-Yeah, and I yelled out:

340
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:04,181
''Kramer, Kramer, you're killing him.''

341
00:19:04,758 --> 00:19:07,246
-So I assume the jig was up.
-Yeah, pretty much.

342
00:19:07,415 --> 00:19:09,105
But look.

343
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:10,859
Yes.

344
00:19:12,054 --> 00:19:14,869
-Hi. Here are your keys.
-Hi. Thank you.

345
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,940
-Hello.
-Audrey.

346
00:19:18,102 --> 00:19:21,102
My God, you look incredible.
I can't believe it.

347
00:19:21,814 --> 00:19:24,814
Well, it was his doctor.
He was wonderful.

348
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:26,865
So will I see you later tonight?

349
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:29,356
Not sure.

350
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:33,741
Well, I'll check you guys out later.

351
00:19:34,485 --> 00:19:36,307
-Ready?
-I didn't wash.

352
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,324
Neither did l.

353
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:41,204
We're off to the reggae lounge.

354
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:51,825
My nose, my nose.
My kingdom for a nose.

355
00:19:52,436 --> 00:19:56,746
Isn't she beautiful? Her nose
is in such perfect proportions...

356
00:19:56,916 --> 00:19:59,437
...to the rest of her face.
She's breathtaking.

357
00:19:59,604 --> 00:20:01,971
-Who would have thought, she's--?
-Elaine...

358
00:20:02,516 --> 00:20:04,076
...shut up.

359
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:08,433
The technical term
for a nose job is...?

360
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:11,530
-Rhinoplasty.
-Rhinoplasty.

361
00:20:12,243 --> 00:20:15,342
Rhino. Okay?

362
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:21,161
Do we really need to insult the person
at this moment of their lives?

363
00:20:21,332 --> 00:20:24,266
They know they have a big nose.
That's why they're coming in.

364
00:20:24,435 --> 00:20:27,784
Do they really need the abuse
of being compared to a rhinoceros...

365
00:20:27,987 --> 00:20:30,059
...on top of everything else?

366
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,655
When someone has a
hair transplant, they don't go:

367
00:20:32,818 --> 00:20:36,047
''We're going to perform a
cue ball-ectomy on you, Mr. Johnson.

368
00:20:36,787 --> 00:20:40,332
We're going to attempt to remove
the skinheadia...

369
00:20:40,498 --> 00:20:43,760
...of your chromedomus,
which is what we--

370
00:20:43,922 --> 00:20:46,343
The technical term....''

9999
