1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,272
Have you noticed that every place
has that tip jar on the counter?

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,908
What is the service that
this tip is for, anyway?

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,436
I mean, isn't the man basically
just turning around?

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,511
Isn't that really all it is?

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,151
I think we're tipping people now just
for the absence of outright hostility.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,716
"Thanks very much,
and here's something extra...

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,074
...for not taking my head...

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,595
...and smashing my face
through the glass countertop.

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,274
Really good service here."

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,354
Well, currently the doors on the
bathroom stalls here at the stadium...

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,750
...don't offer much by way of privacy.

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,037
I was thinking, if we extend the doors
all the way down to the floor...

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,395
Are you out of your mind?
You'd suffocate in there.

14
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,869
You're lucky to have doors.
When I was in the Army...

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,554
Costanza, what is that you're eating?
Looks pretty tasty.

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,517
- It's a calzone, sir.
- Calzone, huh?

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,716
Let's see it. Pass that down.
Let's get a look.

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,598
Big Stein wants a little taste.
Come on.

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,159
Pass it down. That's a good boy.

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,629
Okay, let's...
Hey, what's in this thing?

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,037
Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant.

22
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,838
Eggplant, huh?
That's a hell of a thing.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,797
All right. Back to business.
Here you go.

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,313
Very good. Very good. Excellent.

25
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,710
Excellent little calzone you got there,
Costanza.

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,950
Okay. A little jealous.
All right. Here we go.

27
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,269
Like I told you last week...

28
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,954
...the renovation of the press box
is taking too long.

29
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,633
That eggplant was very good.

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,836
Everybody out.
I've got eggplant on my mind.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,195
Costanza, go get me a couple
of calzones right now.

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,588
Pronto. Move it out.

33
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,399
Big Stein wants an eggplant calzone.
He must have one.

34
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,278
Everybody out. Hurry up, hurry up.

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,674
Who are you having dinner with?

36
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,749
Oh, one of these fabric wholesalers,
this guy Todd Gack.

37
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,236
- I won a bet from him.
- Yeah, what bet?

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,679
He bet me that Dustin Hoffman
was in Star Wars.

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,115
- Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
- Yeah.

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,795
Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader?
I don't think so.

41
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,639
Yeah, that's what I said.

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,075
So the bet was the loser
has to buy dinner?

43
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,798
Yeah.

44
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,469
- What?
- No, nothing.

45
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,879
- What's with you?
- Feel this.

46
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,673
- Wow, that's hot.
- Yes, piping hot.

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,239
It's fresh out of the dryer.

48
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,631
Hey, Elaine, you gotta
feel my pants.

49
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,874
I'll see you later.

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,830
All right. You don't know
what you're missing.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,194
I'm loving this.

52
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,431
I'll never put on another
piece of clothing...

53
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,272
...unless it's straight from the dryer.

54
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,034
Every time you get dressed,
you'll use the basement dryer?

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,873
Oh, yeah. It's a warm
and wonderful feeling, Jerry.

56
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,474
- So, what are you doing later?
- I got a date with Nicki.

57
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,110
- Oh, yeah, she's a beauty.
- Oh, yeah. She's also quite bold.

58
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,750
Bold and beautiful.

59
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,469
This calzone is fantastic.

60
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,029
And look, the pita pocket
prevents it from dripping.

61
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,189
The pita pocket.

62
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,559
Yeah, what is it, Watson?

63
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,109
A lost and found, huh?
No, I don't think we need that.

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,430
If people can't hold onto things,
tough luck.

65
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,591
You got a little junk on your lip,
by the way.

66
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,830
You know, a lost and found
could be a good idea.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,194
Hold it, Watson.

68
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,476
- You like the lost and found, George?
- Definitely.

69
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,348
All right. A lost and found.

70
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,990
But there's gotta be a time limit.
We're not running a pawnshop here.

71
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,718
- Hey, Elaine.
- Jerry, hi.

72
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,029
- This is Nicki.
- Hi.

73
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,918
Hello. This is Todd Gack.

74
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,957
Oh, of course, Todd Gack.

75
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,236
Who did you bet was in Star Wars?
Sammy Davis Jr.?

76
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,792
So, what movie are you guys
gonna see?

77
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,598
Means to an End.

78
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,115
We were gonna see that too,
but it's sold out.

79
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,589
So we're going to see
Blame It On The Rain.

80
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,715
- Why don't you see what you can do.
- Okay.

81
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,154
What 's she gonna do?
They don't have any more tickets.

82
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,629
We'll see.

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,353
Hey, Jerry, you like cigars?

84
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,750
- Yeah, why?
- I'm going to Montreal tomorrow.

85
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,592
They sell Cubans there dirt cheap.

86
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,591
That's a nice idea
for George's wedding.

87
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,149
- Should I get you a box?
- lf they're cheap, why not?

88
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,629
All right, I'll buy them
and get them to Elaine.

89
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,994
Okay. Two tickets.

90
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,878
- Means to an End.
- Told you.

91
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,512
- How did you do that?
- I just talked to the manager.

92
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,470
- All right, enjoy Blame It On The Rain.
- Nice meeting you.

93
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,399
So they're putting in
a lost and found because of me.

94
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,994
I mean, there's a time limit, but still.

95
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,350
They're really building
a Utopian society up there.

96
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,668
- And you attribute this to the calzone?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,910
I'm like a drug dealer.
I got the guy hooked.

98
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,913
I'm having lunch at his desk every day
this week, just him and me.

99
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,469
He doesn't make a move without me.
It's very exciting.

100
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,519
Boy, with you two guys at the helm,
the last piece of the puzzle is in place.

101
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,954
Yeah.

102
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,870
So let me ask you a question
about the tip cup...

103
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,998
...because I had a little thing with
the calzone guy there this week.

104
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,636
I go to drop a buck in the tip jar...

105
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,837
...and just as I'm about to drop it in,
he looks the other way.

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,673
So then, as I'm leaving,
he gives me a look lik e.

107
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,398
"Thanks for nothing."

108
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,118
- You got no credit.
- Exactly.

109
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,793
It's like I'm throwing a buck away.

110
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,428
I mean, if they don't notice it,
what's the point?

111
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,997
So you don't make a habit of
giving to the blind?

112
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,510
Not bills.

113
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,590
Remember I was telling you how Nicki
always gets whatever she wants?

114
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,796
We're at the movies last night,
it's sold out...

115
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,190
...Nicki goes and talks
to the manager... right in.

116
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,440
Beautiful women.
You know, they get away with murder.

117
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,558
You never see one of them
lift anything over three pounds.

118
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,358
They do what they want,
when they want.

119
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,115
- Nobody can stop them.
- She's like a beautiful Godzilla.

120
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,637
And I'm thousands of
fleeing Japanese.

121
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,998
Hey.

122
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,788
What the hell is all this?

123
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,032
It's my change.

124
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,915
I need quarters for the dryer.

125
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,469
Why can't you do this on your table?

126
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,950
Because I don't have a table.

127
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,030
- Hey.
- Hey.

128
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,113
Hey, so how was
Blame It On The Rain?

129
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,672
Hey, thanks for getting
us tickets too.

130
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,910
Elaine, let me ask you a question.

131
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,878
Was the movie part of the bet?

132
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,429
No, we were both
in the mood for one.

133
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,478
You know, Elaine...

134
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,790
...it's not my way to intrude on
the personal lives of close friends...

135
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,234
- Oh, is that so?
- Absolutely.

136
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,437
- but I feel I must inform you
that what happened last night...

137
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,192
...was more than a simple bet.

138
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,112
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

139
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,554
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?

140
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,472
He made a bet he knew
he was gonna lose...

141
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,073
...just to take you to dinner.

142
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,039
Oh, that doesn't make any sense.

143
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,998
I mean, if he wanted to ask me out,
why didn't he just ask me?

144
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,310
If he doesn't ask you out,
he doesn't get rejected.

145
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,994
He's found a dating loophole.

146
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,194
I don't buy it.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,274
What happened after the movie?

148
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,518
Nothing. He walked me home.

149
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,511
- To the door?
- Yeah.

150
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,796
- That's a date.
- No, it's not.

151
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,279
But I never walk you home.

152
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,000
That's just because
you're a jackass.

153
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,752
I found a quarter. Okay.

154
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,434
- Anybody want their clothes heated up?
- No, no, no, thanks.

155
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,315
How'd you leave it?

156
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,516
I'm supposed to meet him
to pick up your cigars.

157
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,718
That's another loophole.

158
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,950
That's two dates
without asking you out.

159
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,197
- You're crazy.
- Crazy like a man.

160
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,112
- Number 49.
- You know, my last name is Costanza.

161
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,269
That's Italian.

162
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,910
So you and I are kind of like
countrymen. Paisanos.

163
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,832
- Six fifty your change.
- Yes.

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,276
And I always take care of my paisanos,
so here's a little something...

165
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,714
Antonio!

166
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,989
Hey, hey, you steal my money?

167
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,196
No, you don't understand.
I wasn't taking it out.

168
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,271
I know what you tried to do.
Get out of here.

169
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,759
Don't come back again, ever.

170
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,912
- Or I break your head open like a...!
- Oh, my God.

171
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,312
I got the calzones, Mr. Steinbrenner.

172
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,118
Oh, beautiful. I'm starving, George.

173
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,716
So I thought tomorrow
maybe we'd try a little corned beef.

174
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,711
Corned beef?

175
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,599
I don't think so.
It's a little fatty, don't you think?

176
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,352
- How about Chinese?
- Chinese?

177
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,114
No, too many containers.
Big mess. Big mess, very sloppy.

178
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,874
We're gonna stick with
the calzones from Paisano's.

179
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,075
That's the ticket.

180
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,478
I just thought it'd be nice,
a little variety.

181
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,914
No, no, no.

182
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,310
When I find something I like,
I stick with it.

183
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,835
From 1973 to 1982,
I ate the exact same lunch every day.

184
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,752
Turkey chilli in a bowl
made out of bread.

185
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,150
Bread bowl. You eat the chilli,
then you eat the bowl.

186
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,709
Nothing more satisfying than
looking down after lunch...

187
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,029
...and seeing just a table.

188
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,594
Thanks for dinner.

189
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,718
I had to give you these cigars.
And since we were both hungry...

190
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,678
Hey, Todd,
let me ask you a question.

191
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,992
Was this whole bet thing
just a way of asking me out?

192
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,030
- What?
- I mean, Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?

193
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,997
Come on.

194
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,758
Elaine, that was a legitimate bet.
I lost, so I bought you dinner.

195
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,077
- All right. Well, good night.
- Yeah.

196
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,437
If you're not doing anything Saturday
night, you wanna meet somewhere?

197
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,239
Now, what is that?

198
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,594
Is that a date?

199
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,430
Why? Why can't two people
just go and do something...

200
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,397
...without it being a date?

201
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,198
All right, all right. I'm sorry.

202
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,157
- It's not a date.
- No way.

203
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,834
- So I'll see you Saturday?
- All right.

204
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,798
Pick you up at 8.

205
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,076
Know what the posted speed limit
is on this road?

206
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,438
- Gotta be 55.
- That's right, it is.

207
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,275
- You know how fast you were going?
- A lot faster than that.

208
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,995
- Step out of the car, sir.
- Okey-doke.

209
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,032
Can I have your license
and registration?

210
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,111
Absolutely.

211
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,554
- Nicki?
- Yeah?

212
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,676
Would you mind bringing
the registration?

213
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,717
Not at all.

214
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,636
I got you on the radar
at 93 miles per hour.

215
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,475
Must have been when
I slowed down to take that curve...

216
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,677
...because for a while there,
I was doing well over 100.

217
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,274
Officer.

218
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,274
Hi.

219
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,715
Do you really
have to give us a ticket?

220
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,277
All right, Nick. Let's hit it.

221
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,071
Hey, buddy.

222
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,391
- I'm waiting for my shirt.
- You got your shirt in my oven?

223
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,471
I didn't have enough
quarters for the dryer...

224
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,437
...but this is better
and more convenient.

225
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,875
- Oh, for both of us.
- And I've got a lot more control.

226
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,828
I got a shirt going
for 10 minutes at 325.

227
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,788
What's wrong with your oven?

228
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,030
I'm baking a pie.

229
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,389
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

230
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,959
- Come on up.
- You got cigars?

231
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,758
I got some Cubans
for George's wedding.

232
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,229
It was more than I wanted to spend,
but what the hell.

233
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,152
Oh, baby, yeah.

234
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,838
What are these?

235
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,594
"Producto de Peru."

236
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,990
Jerry, you think those are Cubans?

237
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,479
Peru?

238
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,232
I paid 300 bucks for these.

239
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,039
I could have got a house in Peru
for 300 bucks.

240
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,832
You got rooked, buddy.

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,592
I gotta pay Todd Gack 300 bucks...

242
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,116
...just so he has some excuse to see
Elaine again without asking her out?

243
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,953
That's a nice name, Todd Gack.

244
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,277
What is that, Dutch?

245
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,954
Oh, baby, here we go.

246
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,875
Oh, mama.

247
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,719
Be right back.
Hey, George, hey.

248
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,390
Well, this is really bad now.
I really am in a bad situation now.

249
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,028
What's Steinbrenner gonna do
if he doesn't get his calzone?

250
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,395
What's he gonna do?
That's exactly the point.

251
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,391
Nobody knows what this guy
is capable of.

252
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,518
He fires people like
it's a bodily function.

253
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,238
Why don't you get somebody else
from the office to go to Paisano's?

254
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,391
Before you know it,
he's having lunch with him.

255
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,312
You know how
interoffice politics work.

256
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,471
No, I never had a job.

257
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,035
I decided to go with the brown ones.

258
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,672
What the hell is this?

259
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,070
Kramer's cooking up some corduroy.

260
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,354
There's gotta be some way
to get back into Paisano's.

261
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,318
Oh, Paisano's. That's that place
by the stadium, isn't it?

262
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,956
- Yeah, you've heard of it?
- Newman raves about it.

263
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,395
It's on his mail route.
He stops by there every day.

264
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,799
I'll see you guys later.

265
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,199
- What kind of pie you cooking?
- Huckleberry.

266
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,273
Well, you certainly are in a bind.

267
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,754
Yeah, and I thought since
you go by there every day...

268
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,071
...maybe we could
help each other out.

269
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,308
Let me be perfectly blunt.

270
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,119
I don't care for you, Costanza.

271
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,478
You hang out on the west side
of the building with Seinfeld all day...

272
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,234
...just laughing it up,
wasting your lives.

273
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,795
- You gonna help me or not?
- All right. I'll help you.

274
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,473
I will help you...

275
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,599
...but I will expect
something in return.

276
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,398
- What?
- Well, for starters...

277
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,437
...I want a calzone of my own.

278
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,548
All right.

279
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,393
And a slice of pepperoni pizza.

280
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,391
And a large soda.

281
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,598
And three times a week,
I shall require a cannoli.

282
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,478
A bit steep, don't you think?

283
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,518
You know, I hear that
Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic.

284
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,636
I'd hate to see him
when he's hungry.

285
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,268
- All right! All right!
- Do we have a deal?

286
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,192
Just make sure you get them
to me by 1:00.

287
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,716
- He's regimented about his meals.
- I know exactly how he feels.

288
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,112
Well, nice doing business with you.
Do come again.

289
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,674
- Oh, this is nice.
- Hi.

290
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,637
Gack, party of four.

291
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,111
Party of four? Who are we meeting?

292
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,840
Mom, Dad.

293
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,076
- This is Elaine.
- Hello.

294
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,872
Hello.

295
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,357
It was nice meeting you.

296
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,118
Bye, Ma.

297
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,352
She's wonderful.

298
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,112
- What the hell was that?
- What?

299
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,316
Why did you
introduce me to your parents?

300
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,074
They're nice people.
I thought you'd like them.

301
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,074
Come on, Todd.
Admit it. This is a date.

302
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,913
Why is this a date?

303
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,674
Saturday night with your parents?

304
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,037
I mean, unless I'm your sister,
this is a date.

305
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,908
I don't understand why
you can't meet someone's parents...

306
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,672
...without classifying it as a date.

307
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:51,196
- Well, if it's not a date, then what is it?
- It's a lovely evening together.

308
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,359
I don't believe this.

309
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,839
I'm gonna get a cab. Join me?

310
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,911
No, that's okay. I'll just walk home.

311
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,594
All right. Well, good night.

312
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,754
Now, what is that?

313
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,079
Hello.

314
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,033
What's this?

315
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,795
Well, I was dropping off
the calzone money for the week.

316
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,749
- Shouldn't you be at work by now?
- Work?

317
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,558
It's raining.

318
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,317
So?

319
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,110
I called in sick. I don't work in the rain.

320
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,556
You don't work in the rain?

321
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,039
You're a mailman.

322
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,909
Neither rain nor sleet nor...
It's the first one!

323
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,029
I was never that big on creeds.

324
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,829
You're supposed to deliver
my calzones. We had a deal.

325
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,471
I believe the deal was that
I get your calzones on my route.

326
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,599
Well, today I won't be going
on my route, will I?

327
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,239
Perhaps tomorrow.

328
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,234
- But I'm paying you.
- Yes, thank you.

329
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,312
Newman!

330
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,715
Peru?

331
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,791
I thought you wanted cigars
from Cuba.

332
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,109
I did.

333
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,350
If these aren't what you wanted,
why pay him?

334
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,714
Well, what could I do?

335
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,832
Unless...

336
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,159
...you paid him a visit.

337
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,513
Okay.

338
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,633
Kramer?

339
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,069
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

340
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,913
I need you to do me a favour.
Get me lunch at Paisano's.

341
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,753
- Wait, what happened to Newman?
- He called in sick.

342
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,668
Oh, right. Yeah, it's raining.

343
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,548
Listen, can you do it?

344
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,154
- Well, what time you want it?
- 1:00. You need some money?

345
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,198
No, no, I got eight tons of change.
I gotta unload it.

346
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,873
All right.

347
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,719
Hey, hold that bus!

348
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,993
Hey!

349
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,832
Hey, buddy.

350
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,833
- It's really wet out there, huh?
- What can I get you?

351
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,197
- I hear you make a mean "calazon."
- Calzone.

352
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,032
- Yeah, calzone, yeah.
- The best.

353
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,714
All right. Well, lay them on me.
I'll have three of them.

354
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,276
- Three calzone.
- Yeah, yeah.

355
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,590
Boy, that's a... That's a big oven.

356
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,789
Hey, listen, I wonder if
you could do me a favour?

357
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,311
- Hey, Todd.
- Hi, Elaine.

358
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,232
- Hi.
- You know Nicki, right?

359
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,914
- Hi, yeah, sure.
- Wait, Elaine will settle this.

360
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,152
Elaine, what does the M stand for
in Richard M. Nixon?

361
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,949
- Milhous.
- I told you so. He said it was Moe.

362
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,756
You owe me a dinner.

363
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,034
All right. Your order is ready.

364
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,953
Three calzones...

365
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,234
...and one hot shirt and jacket.
- Oh, yeah.

366
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,309
This is all burned up. Look at this.

367
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,835
What the hell do I know about
cooking a shirt?

368
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,513
Seven fifty for calzones.

369
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,037
Burned up. I don't know.

370
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,114
- What the hell is this? Pennies?
- Yeah.

371
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,430
- You're paying in change?
- That's all I got.

372
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,909
No, you've got to have bills,
paper money.

373
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,036
- You can't pay with this.
- That's all I got.

374
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,634
- Then you got no calzones.
- Wait a minute! Wait!

375
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,755
What happened to you?
Where are the calzones?

376
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,639
He wouldn't give them to me
because I wanted to pay in change.

377
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,349
- What the hell happened to your shirt?
- He overcooked it.

378
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,311
It's all ruined.

379
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,197
Your clothes smell
just like Paisano's.

380
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,874
There's another Italian place
on Jerome. Maybe I can fool him.

381
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,196
You want me to say it again?
I'll say it again.

382
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,352
I haven't had a pimple since I was 18.
I don't care if you believe me.

383
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,590
And how's this? You're fired.

384
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,480
Okay, you're not.
I'm just a little hungry. I'm sorry.

385
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,392
This Costanza. Where's my calzone?

386
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,993
It's 1: 15. He's late.

387
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,637
Wait a second. I gotta call you back.

388
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,030
That smell. I know that smell.

389
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,668
He's in the building.
Costanza is in the building.

390
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,193
And he's not in this office.

391
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,476
He's got the calzone! Costanza!

392
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,756
I catch you, I'm killing you,
Costanza!

393
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,028
Stupid cigars.

394
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,236
If I didn't send Nicki
over to Todd with these...

395
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,277
...they never would have
gotten together.

396
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,634
These are terrible.

397
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,434
It's like trying to smoke
a chicken bone.

398
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,756
What kind of a name is
Todd Gack anyway?

399
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,111
I think it's Dutch.

400
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,032
I gotta get going.

401
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,553
Where are you going?

402
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,190
I promised Nicki
I'd walk her dog for her.

403
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,476
- But she dumped you.
- I know, I know.

404
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,791
But somehow she explained it to me,
I couldn't say no.

405
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,916
- Smells like a rubber fire.
- What's that?

406
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,310
I said "rubber fire."

407
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,557
Did you end up paying Todd
for these things?

408
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,631
Actually, it's being taken care of
right now.

409
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,112
- Hey, you Gack?
- Yeah.

410
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,271
Yeah, here's your money.

411
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,717
What did he do with it?
It's gotta be here.

412
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,155
I'm not crazy. I can smell it.

413
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,268
These clothes.

414
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,749
Costanza, how come these
clothes smell like calzones?

415
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,074
My friend put them
in the pizza oven.

416
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,629
Put them in a pizza oven?
What for?

417
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,513
To heat them up.

418
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,310
That is not a bad idea.
What about this?

419
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,948
We'll put all the uniforms in
pizza ovens before the game.

420
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,315
That's fantastic.
Keep those muscles loosey-goosey.

421
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,596
This could be big.
Clean up this mess, will you?

422
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,079
Big Stein's onto something.

423
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,437
I smell a pennant!
