1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,739
Parents like to drag kids
to historical sights.

2
00:00:05,915 --> 00:00:08,611
I remember going to
Colonial Williamsburg...

3
00:00:08,785 --> 00:00:12,050
...and you see the supposedly
authentic blacksmith there.

4
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:14,156
He's got the three-cornered hat,
knickers...

5
00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:15,621
...and the Def Leppard shirt.

6
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:20,057
My parents took me to the
Amish country, which to a kid...

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:23,427
...to see a bunch of people that have
no cars, no TV, no phone...

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,727
...they go, "So what? Neither do I."

9
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:28,837
So it's the whole community
that's been grounded.

10
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:31,098
That's the way they should
punish the kids.

11
00:00:31,274 --> 00:00:33,333
"All right, get up to your room.
I've had it.

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,603
You are Amish, young man.

13
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:38,713
For the rest of this weekend.
Did you hear me? Amish.

14
00:00:38,882 --> 00:00:41,783
Don't come down till you make
some noodles and raise a barn."

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,048
They have a guide. He takes you...

16
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:52,023
...shows you the battlefield,
gives you a bit of the history.

17
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:53,856
How far is Gettysburg?
I'd like to go.

18
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,225
- About three hours.
- Tommy, you're on.

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,560
- Gotta go.
- Have a good set.

20
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:04,805
What did they do for toilet paper
in the Civil War?

21
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:09,676
Wonder what toilet paper
was like in the 1860s.

22
00:01:09,846 --> 00:01:12,838
Did they...? Did they carry it
in rolls in their duffel bags?

23
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,914
Everything with you comes down
to toilet paper.

24
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:18,247
- What?
- That's always...

25
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:21,185
...the first question with you.
Why is that always your focus?

26
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:23,889
- Then what did they do?
- I don't know.

27
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,858
Maybe they gave out big loose
clumps to all the soldiers.

28
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:31,100
It would be nice if there was some
sort of historical record of it.

29
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:34,063
They should have a toilet-paper
museum. Would you like that?

30
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:38,198
So we could see all the toilet-paper
advancements down through the ages.

31
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:40,033
Toilet paper during the Crusades.

32
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:43,076
The development of the perforation.
The first six-pack.

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,941
Excuse me, Jerry.

34
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:49,050
I'm Stu Schirmack. I'm from NBC.

35
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:51,015
- Could we speak for a few moments?
- Sure.

36
00:01:51,187 --> 00:01:53,519
- Hi. Jay Crespi.
- Hello.

37
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,057
- C-R-E-S-P-I.
- That's right.

38
00:01:57,226 --> 00:01:58,955
I'm unbelievable
at spelling last names.

39
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:01,255
- Give give me a last name.
- I'm not...

40
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:03,991
George.

41
00:02:04,534 --> 00:02:07,002
All right. All right.

42
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:09,969
First of all...

43
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,907
...that was a terrific show.

44
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:13,472
- Thank you very much.
- And...

45
00:02:13,643 --> 00:02:16,737
And I just wanted to let you know
that we've been discussing you...

46
00:02:16,913 --> 00:02:21,077
...at some of our meetings, and we'd be
very interested in doing something.

47
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,185
- Really?
- So if you had an idea for, like...

48
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:28,347
...a TV show for yourself,
well, we'd just love to talk about it.

49
00:02:29,092 --> 00:02:30,821
I'd be very interested in that.

50
00:02:30,994 --> 00:02:32,586
Well, here.

51
00:02:32,762 --> 00:02:36,493
Why don't you give us a call,
and maybe we can develop a series.

52
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,595
Okay. Great. Thanks.

53
00:02:38,768 --> 00:02:40,668
- It was very nice meeting you.
- Thank you.

54
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:43,567
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you.

55
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:48,274
- What was that all about?
- They said they were interested in me.

56
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,210
- For what?
- You know, TV show.

57
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:54,715
- Your own show?
- Yeah, I guess so.

58
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:58,011
They want you to do a TV show?

59
00:02:58,655 --> 00:03:01,715
They want me to come up with an
idea. I mean, I don't have any ideas.

60
00:03:02,425 --> 00:03:06,452
Come on. How hard is that?
Look at all the junk that's on TV.

61
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,526
You want an idea? Here's an idea.

62
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:12,566
You coach a gymnastics team
in high school, and you're married.

63
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:16,728
Your son is not interested in
gymnastics, and you're pushing him.

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,372
Why should I care if
my son's into gymnastics?

65
00:03:19,542 --> 00:03:23,034
- You're the teacher. It's only natural.
- But gymnastics is not for everybody.

66
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:26,010
- I know, but he's your son.
- So what?

67
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:30,184
All right, forget that idea.

68
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,981
It's not for you.

69
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:34,781
Okay, okay. I got it.

70
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:37,323
You run an antique store.

71
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:40,018
- Yeah. And?
- And people come into the store...

72
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:42,824
...and you get involved in their lives.

73
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,657
What person who runs an antique
store gets involved in people's lives?

74
00:03:47,236 --> 00:03:49,170
- Why not?
- So someone comes in...

75
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:53,798
...to buy an old lamp, and suddenly
I'm getting them out of a jam.

76
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,034
I could see if I was a pharmacist.

77
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:58,680
Because a pharmacist knows
what's wrong with everybody.

78
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,440
Antiques are very popular right now.

79
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,948
- No, they're not. They used to be.
- Oh, sure.

80
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:05,883
- Like you know.
- Oh, like you do.

81
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,487
And you're the manager
of the circus.

82
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:14,494
- The circus?
- Oh, come on. This is a great idea.

83
00:04:14,664 --> 00:04:17,497
Look at the characters. You got
all these freaks in the show.

84
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,066
A woman with a mustache.

85
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:22,029
Who wouldn't tune in to see
a woman with a mustache?

86
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:26,767
You got the tallest man in the world.
A guy who's just a head.

87
00:04:27,577 --> 00:04:28,805
- I don't think so.
- Look...

88
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:31,776
...the show isn't about the circus.
It's about watching freaks.

89
00:04:31,948 --> 00:04:33,779
I don't think the network
would go for it.

90
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,646
- Why not?
- I'm not pitching a show about freaks.

91
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:39,811
Oh, come on, Jerry. You're wrong.
People, they wanna watch freaks.

92
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,889
This is a "can't miss."

93
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:44,583
- Kramer.
- Hello, Newman.

94
00:04:45,895 --> 00:04:47,863
I got the helmet.
Go get the radar detector.

95
00:04:48,064 --> 00:04:50,931
Okay. I'll be back in a second.
You guys coming to my party?

96
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,068
- Yeah. Sure.
- Of course.

97
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:56,668
- What's this about?
- We're making a trade.

98
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,070
I'm giving him my motorcycle helmet.
He's giving me his radar detector.

99
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:03,278
- I didn't know you have a motorcycle.
- Well, my girlfriend had one.

100
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,839
You have a girlfriend?

101
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,812
I had a girlfriend.

102
00:05:07,984 --> 00:05:09,747
And she was pretty wild.

103
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,612
- I don't remember you with a girl.
- Nevertheless.

104
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,422
This is a pretty bad deal for Kramer.

105
00:05:18,594 --> 00:05:22,121
A radar detector's worth much more
than that helmet. You're cheating him.

106
00:05:22,298 --> 00:05:24,698
- Don't say anything.
- All right.

107
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:27,665
Hey, you know you're
getting gypped over here.

108
00:05:29,505 --> 00:05:31,200
Really.

109
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:32,864
Hey. We had a deal.

110
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:35,340
Are you reneging out of the deal?
Are you reneging?

111
00:05:35,511 --> 00:05:37,479
- That's a renege.
- Stop saying "reneging."

112
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,376
- Well, you're reneging.
- Okay, okay. I'm not reneging.

113
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,177
All right. Give it to me.

114
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:44,182
- All right, let go.
- Come on.

115
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:48,012
- Let go on three.
- Give me that. Just give me that!

116
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:50,056
- Three.
- Here.

117
00:05:50,226 --> 00:05:52,387
Idiots.

118
00:05:53,296 --> 00:05:55,389
Thanks, buddy. So long.

119
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,801
- Does that thing work?
- No.

120
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:04,164
I got a postcard from Elaine.

121
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,001
- Really?
- Yeah. They're in London now.

122
00:06:06,175 --> 00:06:08,166
They'll be back in a few weeks.

123
00:06:08,344 --> 00:06:11,177
I can't believe she got
involved with her shrink.

124
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,779
What about the TV show?
Got anything?

125
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,884
No. Nothing.

126
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:17,980
Why don't they have salsa
on the table?

127
00:06:18,955 --> 00:06:20,388
What do you need salsa for?

128
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,591
Salsa is now the number-one
condiment in America.

129
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,090
Do you know why?

130
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:26,990
Because people like to say "salsa."

131
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:30,462
Do you have any salsa?

132
00:06:30,633 --> 00:06:33,329
We need more salsa.
Where is the salsa? No salsa?

133
00:06:34,203 --> 00:06:36,797
You know, it must be impossible
for a Spanish person...

134
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:38,873
...to order seltzer and not get salsa.

135
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:42,972
I wanted seltzer, not salsa.

136
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:45,306
Don't you know the difference
between them?

137
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:47,711
You have the seltzer after the salsa.

138
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:51,449
This should be the show.
This is the show.

139
00:06:51,988 --> 00:06:53,649
- What?
- This.

140
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:55,450
Just talking.

141
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,752
Yeah. Right.

142
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:02,696
No, I'm really serious.
I think that's a good idea.

143
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:05,026
Just talking?
Well, what's the show about?

144
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:07,000
It's about nothing.

145
00:07:08,905 --> 00:07:11,373
- No story?
- No, forget the story.

146
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,907
- You gotta have a story.
- Who says you gotta have a story?

147
00:07:15,077 --> 00:07:18,308
Remember when we were waiting for
that table in that Chinese restaurant?

148
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:20,915
That could be a TV show.

149
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:24,182
And who's on the show?
Who are the characters?

150
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,885
I could be a character.

151
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:29,051
- You?
- Yeah. You base a character on me.

152
00:07:29,225 --> 00:07:32,160
So on the show there's a character
named George Costanza?

153
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:35,889
Yeah. What? There's something
wrong with that? I'm a character.

154
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:39,432
People are always saying to me,
"You know, you're quite a character."

155
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:42,164
And who else is on the show?

156
00:07:42,438 --> 00:07:44,906
Elaine could be a character. Kramer.

157
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:47,738
Now, he's a character.

158
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,470
So everybody I know
is a character on the show.

159
00:07:50,646 --> 00:07:51,943
Right.

160
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:54,412
- And it's about nothing.
- Absolutely nothing.

161
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,182
So you're saying I go into NBC
and tell them...

162
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:59,514
...I got this idea
for a show about nothing.

163
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,254
We go into NBC.

164
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,683
We? Since when are you a writer?

165
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,995
What writer?
We're talking about a sitcom.

166
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:10,564
You wanna go with me to NBC?

167
00:08:10,766 --> 00:08:12,324
Yeah, we really got something here.

168
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:13,729
- What do we got?
- An idea.

169
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:15,928
- What idea?
- An idea for the show.

170
00:08:16,105 --> 00:08:19,768
- I still don't know what the idea is.
- It's about nothing.

171
00:08:20,176 --> 00:08:21,939
- Right.
- Everybody's doing something.

172
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:24,079
We'll do nothing.

173
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:27,516
We go into NBC, tell them we got
an idea for a show about nothing.

174
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:29,412
- Exactly.
- "What's your show about?"

175
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:31,576
- I say, "Nothing."
- There you go.

176
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:34,015
I think you may have something here.

177
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:38,824
So the show would be
about my real life...

178
00:08:38,995 --> 00:08:42,192
...and one of the characters
would be based on you.

179
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:44,490
No, I don't think so.

180
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:46,566
What do you mean,
you don't you think so?

181
00:08:46,802 --> 00:08:48,497
- I don't like it.
- I don't understand.

182
00:08:48,671 --> 00:08:50,764
- What don't you like?
- I don't like the idea...

183
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,908
...of a character based on me.
- Why not?

184
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,271
I don't know. It just doesn't sit well.

185
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:58,907
You're my neighbor.
There's gotta be a character.

186
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:02,141
- That's your problem, buddy.
- I don't understand what the deal is.

187
00:09:02,318 --> 00:09:04,013
Okay. You can do it on one condition.

188
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:06,211
- Whatever you want.
- I get to play Kramer.

189
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:09,324
- You can't play Kramer.
- I am Kramer.

190
00:09:09,592 --> 00:09:10,820
But you can't act.

191
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,130
- Okay, fine, we'll use Newman.
- Newman?

192
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:20,393
- Use me for what?
- Nothing. What do you want?

193
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:23,299
Well, you'll never guess
what happened to me today.

194
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:26,839
I was driving home on
the Palisades Parkway...

195
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:31,776
...when I look in the rearview mirror,
and what did I see?

196
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:34,006
The fuzz. And it's funny...

197
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:39,416
...because my new radar detector
was on, but I didn't hear a thing.

198
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:42,523
- Isn't that strange?
- Yeah, that's strange.

199
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:46,855
Because the radar detector,
as I understand it, detects radar!

200
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:49,497
With a series of beeps
and flashing lights.

201
00:09:49,665 --> 00:09:51,690
But for some reason,
I didn't hear a thing...

202
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:53,698
...except for the sound
of a police siren.

203
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:56,130
Well, that's queer, huh?

204
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:58,269
I want my helmet back!

205
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:00,875
You give me back my helmet,
and pay for that ticket!

206
00:10:01,043 --> 00:10:03,978
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You better think again, MoJumbo.

207
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:07,913
You gave me a defective detector.

208
00:10:08,084 --> 00:10:09,608
- Jerry?
- Buyer beware.

209
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:11,480
Are you gonna give me
back my helmet?

210
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:14,384
No, we had a deal.
There's no guarantees in life.

211
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:16,215
No, but there's karma, Kramer.

212
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:18,155
Karma Kramer?

213
00:10:19,128 --> 00:10:20,356
And one more thing:

214
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:22,588
I'm not coming to your party!

215
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:29,697
Salsa, seltzer.

216
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:31,868
Do you have any salsa?

217
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,373
No, not seltzer, salsa.

218
00:10:35,778 --> 00:10:38,679
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

219
00:10:39,148 --> 00:10:40,615
You sure?

220
00:10:40,783 --> 00:10:43,047
- You look a little pale.
- No, I'm fine. I'm good.

221
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:44,948
Fine. Very good.

222
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:47,954
- What, are you nervous?
- No, I'm not nervous. I'm very good.

223
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:51,719
- I can't do this. I can't do this.
- What?

224
00:10:51,894 --> 00:10:54,089
I can't. I've tried. I'm here.
It's impossible.

225
00:10:54,263 --> 00:10:56,527
- This was your idea.
- What idea?

226
00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:00,100
I just said something. I didn't
know you were gonna listen to me!

227
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:02,028
Don't worry about it.

228
00:11:02,404 --> 00:11:04,429
They're just TV executives.

229
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:07,599
They're men with jobs, Jerry!

230
00:11:08,744 --> 00:11:10,735
They wear suits and ties.

231
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:14,110
They're married.
They have secretaries!

232
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:16,217
- I told you not to come.
- I need some water.

233
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,818
I gotta get some water.

234
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:20,820
- They'll give us water in there.
- Really?

235
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:24,826
That's pretty good.

236
00:11:29,098 --> 00:11:31,828
- Oh, God, it's Joe Davola.
- Who?

237
00:11:32,134 --> 00:11:33,863
This guy's a writer. He's a total nut.

238
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:36,163
I think he goes to
the same shrink as Elaine.

239
00:11:38,307 --> 00:11:40,400
Oh, God, he saw me.

240
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,243
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hey, Joe!

241
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,808
How you doing?

242
00:11:45,981 --> 00:11:48,541
You're under no obligation
to shake my hand.

243
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:52,017
Oh, no. Just a custom.

244
00:11:52,188 --> 00:11:54,850
That's my friend, George.

245
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,952
You look good.

246
00:11:57,126 --> 00:11:58,593
Why shouldn't I look good?

247
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:02,028
No. No reason.
You do the karate, right?

248
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:04,531
Yeah, you wanna hit me?

249
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,362
- What are you doing here?
- I dropped a script off.

250
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,836
Good for you.

251
00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:18,840
Well.

252
00:12:19,014 --> 00:12:21,778
- You don't have to say anything.
- No...

253
00:12:21,951 --> 00:12:24,943
- Hey, I guess I'll see you Sunday night.
- Why?

254
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,985
Kramer's party.

255
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:31,889
- Kramer's having a party?
- No. No, he's not having a party.

256
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:35,925
He's doing something. I don't know.
It's nothing. He's not doing anything.

257
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:38,858
I thought Kramer and I
were very close friends.

258
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:42,435
No, I'm sure you are.
I'm sure you're very close friends.

259
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:44,539
Very close.

260
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:47,534
Give my best to Hinckley.

261
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,450
- What was that?
- I can't believe what I did.

262
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:58,314
I didn't know Kramer didn't invite him.
I gotta call Kramer.

263
00:12:58,721 --> 00:13:00,154
They're ready for you.

264
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,449
Okay. Okay. Look.

265
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,923
- You... You do all the talking. Okay?
- Oh, relax!

266
00:13:05,094 --> 00:13:07,756
- Who are they?
- Yeah.

267
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,898
- They're not better than me.
- Of course not.

268
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,862
- Who are they?
- They're nobody.

269
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:13,433
- What about me?
- What about you?

270
00:13:13,602 --> 00:13:15,627
- Why them? Why not me?
- Why not you?

271
00:13:15,804 --> 00:13:17,738
- I'm just as good as them.
- Better.

272
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:20,067
- You really think so?
- No.

273
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:41,226
The bit... The bit I really liked was
where the parakeet flew into the mirror.

274
00:13:41,397 --> 00:13:43,160
That was funny.

275
00:13:45,934 --> 00:13:48,459
The parakeet in the mirror.
That is a good one, Stu.

276
00:13:48,637 --> 00:13:51,197
Yeah. One of my favorites.

277
00:13:54,009 --> 00:13:57,604
What about you, George? Have you
written anything we might know?

278
00:14:00,616 --> 00:14:03,084
Well, possibly. I...

279
00:14:03,352 --> 00:14:06,947
I wrote an off-Broadway show.

280
00:14:07,122 --> 00:14:09,147
La Cocina.

281
00:14:09,325 --> 00:14:11,589
Actually, it was off-off Broadway.

282
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,027
It was a comedy
about a Mexican chef.

283
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,997
It was... It was very funny.

284
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:23,502
There was one great scene
with the chef.

285
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:25,833
What was his name?

286
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:28,600
- Pepe.
- Oh, Pepe. Yes, Pepe.

287
00:14:28,777 --> 00:14:30,642
And he was making tamales.

288
00:14:30,813 --> 00:14:32,713
Oh, he actually cooked on the stage?

289
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:37,041
No, no, he mimed it.
That's what was so funny about it.

290
00:14:38,654 --> 00:14:40,918
So, what have you two
come up with?

291
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,183
We thought about this
in a variety of ways...

292
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:47,261
...but the basic idea is I play myself...
- May I?

293
00:14:47,863 --> 00:14:49,558
Go ahead.

294
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:54,264
I think I can sum up the show
for you with one word:

295
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,067
Nothing.

296
00:14:57,973 --> 00:15:00,066
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

297
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:01,741
What does that mean?

298
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:05,911
The show is about nothing.

299
00:15:07,816 --> 00:15:10,114
- It's not about nothing.
- No, it's about nothing.

300
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,480
Well, maybe in philosophy.

301
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:14,087
But even nothing is something.

302
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:16,517
Mr. Dalrymple, your niece
is on the phone.

303
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:20,924
- I'll call back.
- D-A-L-R-l-M-P-E-L.

304
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:22,961
Not even close.

305
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:26,267
- Is that with a Y?
- No.

306
00:15:29,204 --> 00:15:32,230
- What's the premise?
- As I was saying, I would play myself...

307
00:15:32,408 --> 00:15:34,706
...as a comedian
living in New York...

308
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:37,710
...and I have a friend and a neighbor
and an ex-girlfriend.

309
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,713
- Which is all true.
- But nothing happens on the show.

310
00:15:40,883 --> 00:15:42,373
You see, it's just like life.

311
00:15:42,551 --> 00:15:46,715
You know, you eat, you go
shopping, you read, you eat...

312
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:50,120
...you read, you go shopping.
- You read?

313
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:52,453
You read on the show?

314
00:15:52,628 --> 00:15:56,530
Well, I don't know about the reading.
We didn't discuss the reading.

315
00:15:58,467 --> 00:16:00,196
All right, tell me about the stories.

316
00:16:00,369 --> 00:16:02,394
- What kind of stories?
- Oh, no. No stories.

317
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:04,163
No stories?

318
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,736
- So, what is it?
- What did you do today?

319
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:11,279
- I got up and came to work.
- There's a show. That's a show.

320
00:16:12,114 --> 00:16:13,741
How is that a show?

321
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,441
Well, maybe something happens
to you on the way to work.

322
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:19,678
No. No! No! Nothing happens!

323
00:16:19,855 --> 00:16:21,823
Well, something happens.

324
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,084
- Well, why am I watching it?
- Because it's on TV.

325
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:27,492
Not yet.

326
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,932
Okay, look.

327
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:37,037
If you wanna just keep doing
the same old thing...

328
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:40,733
...then maybe this idea is not for you.

329
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:45,810
I, for one, am not going to
compromise my artistic integrity.

330
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:48,142
And I'll tell you something else:

331
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,547
This is the show,
and we're not gonna change it.

332
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:54,484
Right?

333
00:16:57,793 --> 00:16:59,488
How about this?

334
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:01,788
I manage a circus.

335
00:17:08,203 --> 00:17:10,467
I don't even wanna talk
about it anymore.

336
00:17:11,673 --> 00:17:13,436
What were you thinking?

337
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:15,133
What was going on in your mind?

338
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:17,474
Artistic integrity.

339
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:19,546
Well, where did you
come up with that?

340
00:17:19,715 --> 00:17:22,775
You're not artistic,
and you have no integrity.

341
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:27,314
You really need some help. A regular
psychiatrist couldn't even help you.

342
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:29,548
You need to go to, like,
Vienna or something.

343
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:33,156
You know what I mean? You need
to get involved at the university level.

344
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:35,828
Like where Freud studied,
and have people looking...

345
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:38,296
...and checking up on you.
That's the kind you need.

346
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:42,028
Not the once-a-week for 80 bucks.
No. You need a team.

347
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:45,671
A team of psychiatrists,
working round the clock...

348
00:17:45,841 --> 00:17:47,934
...thinking about you,
having conferences.

349
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,477
Observing you, like the way
they did with the Elephant Man.

350
00:17:51,647 --> 00:17:55,344
That's what I'm talking about. That's
the only way you're gonna get better.

351
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:01,754
I thought the woman
was kind of cute.

352
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:05,558
Hold it. I really wanna
be clear about this.

353
00:18:05,727 --> 00:18:08,423
Are you talking about
the woman in the meeting?

354
00:18:08,897 --> 00:18:10,797
Is that the woman
you're talking about?

355
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:13,400
Yeah. I thought I might
give her a call.

356
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,269
I don't meet that many women.
I meet, like, three women a year.

357
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,931
I mean, we've been introduced.
She knows my name.

358
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:23,737
- It's completely inappropriate.
- Why?

359
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:26,938
Maybe she liked me. I mean, she...
She was looking right at me.

360
00:18:27,683 --> 00:18:29,173
I think she was impressed.

361
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:32,445
We had good eye contact
through the whole meeting.

362
00:18:33,088 --> 00:18:37,184
- Oh, I forgot to call Kramer.
- Wait a minute, let me call Susan.

363
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,260
- No, this is more important.
- She might leave work any minute.

364
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:43,091
No, I gotta warn him that I told
Joe Davola about his party.

365
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:44,755
No!

366
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,771
What is it?

367
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:57,236
I was just thinking about
this patient of mine.

368
00:18:57,613 --> 00:18:58,841
What?

369
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:02,006
Just wondering if he's taking
his medication.

370
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:06,078
Come on. We're on vacation.

371
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:12,723
Well, we were standing
in the waiting area there...

372
00:19:12,894 --> 00:19:15,158
...and you know how Davola is.
He's all...

373
00:19:17,499 --> 00:19:19,933
- Yeah?
- It's George.

374
00:19:20,769 --> 00:19:23,704
And so I felt very
uncomfortable with him...

375
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,705
...and, you know, I just blurted out
something about your party.

376
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:30,476
- Back up a second.
- I didn't know that you didn't invite him.

377
00:19:30,646 --> 00:19:31,977
Why would I invite him?

378
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:33,944
- Well, I just assumed that...
- Assumed?

379
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:37,117
Never assume anything.
I don't want that nut in my house.

380
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:38,843
You know he's on medication.

381
00:19:39,454 --> 00:19:42,685
- Well, hello. Oh, hello.
- Hello.

382
00:19:42,858 --> 00:19:45,554
You remember Susan from NBC.

383
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,855
- Of course. How are you?
- Fine. Good to see you.

384
00:19:49,031 --> 00:19:51,829
- This is Kramer.
- Hello.

385
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,634
All right, go ahead, Susan. Tell him.

386
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:56,828
- Tell me what?
- Well, l...

387
00:19:57,105 --> 00:19:58,629
I'm sorry. Excuse me one second.

388
00:19:58,807 --> 00:20:00,035
- Hello?
- Hi...

389
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,006
...would you be interested
in switching to TMI long distance?

390
00:20:03,178 --> 00:20:04,736
Oh, l... I can't talk right now.

391
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,746
Why don't you give me your home
number, and I'll call you later?

392
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,816
I'm sorry. We're not allowed
to do that.

393
00:20:10,052 --> 00:20:12,247
I guess you don't want
people calling you at home.

394
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:15,481
- No.
- Well, now you know how I feel.

395
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,695
- So go ahead. Tell him.
- Well...

396
00:20:24,199 --> 00:20:25,928
Kramer, are you drinking that milk?

397
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:29,903
- Yeah.
- What's the expiration date on that?

398
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:33,264
September third.

399
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:35,672
- The third?
- The third?

400
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,818
Never should have
brought her up there.

401
00:20:51,193 --> 00:20:53,218
Should have known better.

402
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:55,794
I should have seen it coming.
I didn't see it coming.

403
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,627
I think she saw it coming.

404
00:21:01,503 --> 00:21:04,802
You know, she was behind the idea.
She was gonna champion the show.

405
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,271
I was bringing her up to tell you,
and she liked me.

406
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:12,272
Look, just because Kramer vomited
on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.

407
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:14,514
What are you, crazy?

408
00:21:14,683 --> 00:21:17,243
It's a traumatic thing
to be thrown up on.

409
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:19,747
Vomiting is not a deal-breaker.

410
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:22,116
If Hitler had vomited on Chamberlain...

411
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,417
...he still would have
given him Czechoslovakia.

412
00:21:24,593 --> 00:21:25,821
Chamberlain.

413
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:30,090
You could hold his head in the toilet,
he'd still give you half of Europe.

414
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:33,599
What happened to you?

415
00:21:34,302 --> 00:21:35,633
Davola came after me.

416
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:37,696
What? Davola?

417
00:21:37,873 --> 00:21:40,637
See, this guy is crazy.
I can't believe this. What happened?

418
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:43,539
Can I get coffee? You know,
I was walking home...

419
00:21:43,745 --> 00:21:47,146
I had to pick up my helmet from
the shop. I had to get a new strap.

420
00:21:47,449 --> 00:21:50,612
So I had it on, and I was checking
the strap out to make sure it fit.

421
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:54,619
And suddenly, I feel this kick
hit me on the side of the head.

422
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,350
It knocks me down. I look up,
and it's Crazy Joe Davola.

423
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:02,527
And he says, "That's what I think
of your party."

424
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:05,326
Boy, that is some kick.

425
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,661
Newman's helmet, it saved my life.
Look at that.

426
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:09,463
Wow, Newman's helmet.

427
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:12,266
I got bad news for you, buddy.

428
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,930
Davola says you're next.

429
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:15,771
Me? Why?

430
00:22:16,244 --> 00:22:17,734
He doesn't like you.

431
00:22:17,913 --> 00:22:21,007
What does he want from me?
I didn't do anything.

432
00:22:21,283 --> 00:22:24,980
See, this is all Elaine's fault. She took
off to Europe with his psychiatrist.

433
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:27,849
He can't get his medication.
Now I got some nut after me.

434
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,817
Pass the cream.

435
00:22:30,525 --> 00:22:32,220
Wait a second.

436
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:34,985
All right.

437
00:22:42,938 --> 00:22:44,371
When you vomit on somebody...

438
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:46,734
...it is a social faux pas...

439
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,536
...from which there
is really no recovery.

440
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:53,575
At that point, there's really very
little you can say to the person.

441
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:56,512
There's no Hallmark cards
that cover this occasion.

442
00:22:56,818 --> 00:22:59,844
There's no vomit sympathy-card
section of the store, you know.

443
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,750
"You wear it well."
You know, there's no words...

444
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,949
...that really capture, you know...

445
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:06,491
"Next time, lunch is on me."

446
00:23:06,661 --> 00:23:11,758
There's no, really,
way to phrase the sentiment.

447
00:23:19,507 --> 00:23:21,737
Where the hell did I put it?

448
00:23:24,346 --> 00:23:26,405
- Where did I put it?
- What are you looking for?

449
00:23:26,581 --> 00:23:28,776
The remote. The remote.
I can't find the remote.

450
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,077
Did l...? I lost it.
Did you take it?

451
00:23:31,253 --> 00:23:33,118
- Did you put it someplace?
- No, no, no.

452
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:35,017
All right, what is this?

453
00:23:35,323 --> 00:23:38,986
- What is what?
- All right, very funny. I get it.

454
00:23:39,194 --> 00:23:40,786
- You're in a weird mood.
- Come on.

455
00:23:40,962 --> 00:23:42,520
Go to your apartment and fix it.

456
00:23:42,697 --> 00:23:44,562
- Fix what?
- Your pants!

457
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:50,229
What is this? Why do I got
one pant leg on for?

458
00:23:50,405 --> 00:23:51,872
Don't you know?
Look at your face.

459
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,237
You only shaved the right side
of your face.

460
00:23:55,744 --> 00:23:58,235
- What is this, a joke?
- No joke. What? A joke?

461
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:00,472
You think this is funny?

462
00:24:00,849 --> 00:24:03,875
Well, look at your face in the mirror.

463
00:24:06,288 --> 00:24:07,516
- Yeah?
- It's George.

464
00:24:07,689 --> 00:24:09,213
Come on up.

465
00:24:10,692 --> 00:24:13,490
- I don't believe this.
- You didn't know you were doing this?

466
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:14,754
No, I swear.

467
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,558
I'll bet this is from that kick
from that Crazy Joe Davola.

468
00:24:17,732 --> 00:24:19,666
You better see a doctor
and get some x-rays.

469
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:22,868
Just the man I'm looking for.

470
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:24,300
- Me?
- Yeah. Here you go.

471
00:24:24,472 --> 00:24:26,201
- What's this?
- A dry-cleaning bill.

472
00:24:26,374 --> 00:24:27,966
- From that woman at NBC?
- Yeah.

473
00:24:28,143 --> 00:24:29,838
Dry cleaning bill for what?

474
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:32,236
For vomiting on her vest.

475
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:35,380
Oh, come on, George.
I didn't do that on purpose.

476
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:37,744
- I shouldn't have to pay.
- Neither should I.

477
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,944
Jerry left the milk in the refrigerator.

478
00:24:40,121 --> 00:24:41,782
- Yeah, it's your milk.
- He drank it.

479
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:43,185
- I didn't know.
- All right.

480
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:45,292
Well, we should all chip in, I guess.

481
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,291
- Yeah.
- How much was it to clean the vest?

482
00:24:47,462 --> 00:24:49,259
Eighteen dollars.

483
00:24:49,431 --> 00:24:51,899
Can you get vomit out of suede?

484
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:55,735
- I don't know.
- Yo-Yo Ma!

485
00:24:58,606 --> 00:25:00,597
What? Yo-Yo Ma?

486
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:03,439
What about him?

487
00:25:03,611 --> 00:25:06,512
- You just said, "Yo-Yo Ma."
- What's Yo-Yo Ma?

488
00:25:06,681 --> 00:25:07,909
He's a cellist.

489
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:10,074
You should see a doctor today.

490
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:11,980
All right. Let's go. Six dollars.

491
00:25:12,153 --> 00:25:14,018
I can't believe
she sent a cleaning bill.

492
00:25:14,189 --> 00:25:15,486
I know.

493
00:25:15,657 --> 00:25:18,125
And it doesn't really bode well
for the show, does it?

494
00:25:18,293 --> 00:25:21,456
Forget about the show. We should
take the idea to a different network.

495
00:25:21,629 --> 00:25:23,153
Oh, yeah. Right.

496
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:26,164
Like anybody's ever gonna do this.

497
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:28,029
How did you get me to go with that?

498
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:30,967
A show about nothing.

499
00:25:33,808 --> 00:25:36,641
It was a good idea.
Susan liked it.

500
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:39,837
And if he hadn't vomited all over her,
we'd be writing it right now.

501
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:52,486
What are you doing?

502
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,288
What's wrong with you?
What are you doing? Give me that.

503
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,828
Go to your apartment and lie down.
I'll make an appointment for a doctor.

504
00:26:02,904 --> 00:26:04,735
Hello? Oh, hi, I'm sorry.

505
00:26:04,906 --> 00:26:07,136
No, that's my neighbor.
He's not quite himself.

506
00:26:07,308 --> 00:26:09,139
He got kicked in the head.

507
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:11,935
What? Really? You're kidding.

508
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:15,844
Today? Yeah, sure.
We could make it. Two o'clock?

509
00:26:16,017 --> 00:26:17,678
Yeah, we could do that.

510
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,853
Okay. Great. Thanks a million.

511
00:26:20,021 --> 00:26:21,249
Okay. Bye.

512
00:26:21,423 --> 00:26:23,015
- What?
- NBC.

513
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,259
They wanna have another meeting.

514
00:26:25,493 --> 00:26:27,859
They wanna have another meeting?

515
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:30,896
They wanna buy it!
They wanna buy it! What did I tell you?

516
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:32,795
We'll be rich!
What are we gonna get?

517
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,197
- Fifty, 60 thousand.
- I don't know about 60.

518
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:37,600
Oh, it's gotta be 50.

519
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:39,865
You know how much
Ted Danson makes?

520
00:26:40,075 --> 00:26:42,543
Ted Danson. Now, how are you
comparing us to Ted Danson?

521
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,476
- I didn't say we're Ted Danson.
- You did. You said we're Ted Danson.

522
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:50,741
- You know, I think he wears a piece.
- Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.

523
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:54,812
- What time do you have?
- Five till.

524
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:56,456
See, I'm 10 minutes slow again.

525
00:26:56,691 --> 00:26:58,852
That's it for this piece of junk.
I've had it.

526
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:01,257
- The one your parents gave you?
- It never works.

527
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:03,556
We're supposed to be there.
We should take a cab.

528
00:27:03,731 --> 00:27:05,824
We'll be a little late.
I'm not taking a cab.

529
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,865
- I'll pay for it.
- It's not the money.

530
00:27:08,036 --> 00:27:10,971
What is it you object to? The comfort?
The speed? The convenience?

531
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:14,633
Jerry!

532
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:16,709
- Uncle Leo!
- Hello!

533
00:27:16,878 --> 00:27:18,743
Hello there. How you doing?

534
00:27:18,913 --> 00:27:22,212
- How are you? How's Mom and Dad?
- Good. Fine.

535
00:27:22,383 --> 00:27:25,614
What, are you getting to be too much
of a big shot now to give me a call?

536
00:27:25,887 --> 00:27:27,684
I don't hear from you anymore.

537
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:29,824
Oh, no, I've been kind
of busy, that's all.

538
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:32,050
You know where I just came from?

539
00:27:32,227 --> 00:27:34,661
- Danny Barber.
- Oh, sure. Danny.

540
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:36,456
He used to be in
the pajama business.

541
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:38,258
Remember, I got my pajamas
for free.

542
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:40,230
I used to come over
and give you pajamas.

543
00:27:40,401 --> 00:27:41,629
Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.

544
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,269
Funny thing is, I can't wear them.
I get too hot.

545
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,135
I sleep in my underwear and a T-shirt.

546
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:49,435
If it gets too hot, I just
take the T-shirt off.

547
00:27:49,611 --> 00:27:52,136
Anyway, Danny says to me:

548
00:27:52,313 --> 00:27:54,543
- "You need any pajamas?"
- I'm sorry, Uncle Leo.

549
00:27:54,716 --> 00:27:56,013
I really gotta get going.

550
00:27:57,952 --> 00:28:01,217
Well, you gotta get going, so go.

551
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,482
We got a big meeting
with the president of NBC.

552
00:28:03,691 --> 00:28:06,660
- Nobody got a gun to your head.
- Yeah. I'm really sorry.

553
00:28:06,828 --> 00:28:08,159
Go. Really, I understand.

554
00:28:08,329 --> 00:28:10,388
You got an appointment.
Go to your appointment.

555
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,658
- I'm sorry. Really.
- You know...

556
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,699
...I know plenty of people
in Hollywood too.

557
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:18,269
Sorry. Really.

558
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:38,085
- Yeah?
- Come on, are you ready? Let's go.

559
00:28:40,795 --> 00:28:42,353
- For what?
- What's with you?

560
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,430
I just talked to you 15 minutes ago.

561
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:46,660
- About what?
- The courthouse.

562
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:49,735
You gotta go with me to court.
I'm contesting the ticket.

563
00:28:49,904 --> 00:28:52,566
- I can't. I'm going to the doctor's later.
- You gotta go.

564
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,765
You're my alibi.
You have to take the stand.

565
00:28:54,943 --> 00:28:57,343
- Well, I can't.
- Well, let me remind you of something.

566
00:28:57,512 --> 00:29:00,481
You wouldn't even be here today
if it wasn't for me and my helmet.

567
00:29:00,648 --> 00:29:03,048
I saved your life. You would be dead!

568
00:29:03,218 --> 00:29:06,210
You would cease to exist.
You'd be gone for the rest of eternity.

569
00:29:06,387 --> 00:29:08,617
Can you even begin to comprehend
what that means?

570
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,779
Shut up!

571
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:12,153
I'll get my coat.

572
00:29:12,393 --> 00:29:14,122
Don't step on anything.

573
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:20,363
There are many things that
I think you can point to...

574
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:23,504
...as proof that the humans
are not smart.

575
00:29:23,838 --> 00:29:27,865
But my personal favorite would have
to be that we had to invent the helmet.

576
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:29,737
What happened was
we were involved...

577
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:32,971
...in a lot of activities
that were cracking our heads.

578
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:36,981
We chose not to avoid doing
these activities, but instead...

579
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:39,176
...to come up with
some sort of device...

580
00:29:39,354 --> 00:29:43,450
...to help us continue enjoying
our head-cracking lifestyles:

581
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:44,853
The helmet.

582
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:46,888
Not enough people
were wearing them...

583
00:29:47,061 --> 00:29:49,052
...so we had to come up
with the helmet law...

584
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,892
...which is even stupider.
The idea behind the helmet law...

585
00:29:52,066 --> 00:29:56,025
...is to preserve a brain whose
judgment is so poor...

586
00:29:56,204 --> 00:30:00,334
...it does not even try to stop
the cracking of the head it's in.

587
00:30:02,377 --> 00:30:05,904
Did you see the look on his face?
Did you see how insulted he was?

588
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,344
What could I do?
What are we supposed to do?

589
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,813
You can't leave.

590
00:30:09,984 --> 00:30:13,215
There's no excuse good
enough to justify walking away...

591
00:30:13,388 --> 00:30:15,720
...from a conversation
with one of my relatives.

592
00:30:16,224 --> 00:30:18,988
I didn't shave this morning.
I don't feel like myself.

593
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:24,325
You could be a fireman on
a fire truck on the way to a fire.

594
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:26,967
You bump into one of my relatives,
"Sorry, Uncle Leo...

595
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:30,866
...there's a building full of people
burning down. I do have to be running."

596
00:30:31,239 --> 00:30:36,472
He'll go, "Go. Go ahead.
Go to your fancy fire.

597
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:40,311
If that's what you have to do."

598
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:43,742
- Look at this.
- Why didn't you shave this morning?

599
00:30:43,918 --> 00:30:46,682
Because I shaved yesterday
in the afternoon.

600
00:30:46,854 --> 00:30:48,287
- Why?
- Because of the day before.

601
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:50,253
It's a long story.

602
00:30:50,425 --> 00:30:51,824
I can't get back on schedule.

603
00:30:53,695 --> 00:30:55,595
Is that Joe Davola?

604
00:30:55,763 --> 00:30:58,027
It's not him!

605
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,965
I can't live like this. I'm being stalked.

606
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:02,964
Mr. Seinfeld. They're ready for you.

607
00:31:04,172 --> 00:31:06,299
Mr. Seinfeld.
What about Mr. Costanza?

608
00:31:06,474 --> 00:31:08,237
I'm not here?

609
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:09,971
All right. You promised.

610
00:31:10,144 --> 00:31:12,874
You're gonna be a little more
flexible on the nothing idea.

611
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:16,107
- Just a little.
- All right. A little.

612
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:20,014
Okay. You all set?
You got your story?

613
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:21,416
- No.
- When he stopped me...

614
00:31:21,589 --> 00:31:25,081
...I told him I was rushing because my
friend was about to commit suicide.

615
00:31:25,626 --> 00:31:26,854
Now, you're that friend.

616
00:31:27,028 --> 00:31:31,397
All we need is a reason why
you were gonna commit suicide.

617
00:31:33,901 --> 00:31:35,994
I never had an air conditioner.

618
00:31:38,005 --> 00:31:40,132
No. That's no reason to kill yourself.

619
00:31:40,341 --> 00:31:42,571
Why? It gets hot at night.
You can't sleep.

620
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:44,506
You ever try to sleep in a hot room?

621
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:47,546
I sleep in a really hot room.
I don't wanna kill myself.

622
00:31:47,749 --> 00:31:50,411
I've slept in really hot rooms,
and I wanted to kill myself.

623
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:54,280
No, no, that's not gonna work.
Something else.

624
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:59,320
I was never able
to become a banker.

625
00:32:00,895 --> 00:32:03,830
Banker! So you're killing yourself...

626
00:32:03,998 --> 00:32:08,025
...because your dreams of becoming
a banker have gone unfulfilled.

627
00:32:08,202 --> 00:32:10,898
You... You... You can't live
without being a banker.

628
00:32:11,072 --> 00:32:13,597
Yeah, yeah. If I can't be a banker,
I don't wanna live.

629
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:17,305
- You must be a banker!
- Must be a banker!

630
00:32:17,612 --> 00:32:19,603
Okay, we'll go with the banker story.

631
00:32:27,688 --> 00:32:31,590
Story is the foundation
of all entertainment.

632
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:36,487
You must have a good story.
Otherwise, it's just masturbation.

633
00:32:44,272 --> 00:32:46,570
And people really have
to care about the characters.

634
00:32:46,874 --> 00:32:48,705
Care? Forget about care. Love.

635
00:32:48,876 --> 00:32:50,707
They have to love them. Otherwise...

636
00:32:50,878 --> 00:32:52,539
...why tune in?
- Wouldn't tune in.

637
00:32:52,713 --> 00:32:54,874
- Would they tune in?
- No tune.

638
00:32:55,716 --> 00:32:58,241
We like to look at a show
as if it were an EKG.

639
00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:01,582
You have your highs and your lows.
And it goes up and down.

640
00:33:01,756 --> 00:33:04,122
This show will be like a heart attack.

641
00:33:04,292 --> 00:33:07,261
Just a huge, massive coronary.

642
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:09,953
So, what you said last week
about no story...

643
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:12,095
...you're a little flexible on that now.

644
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:18,338
Is that what I said, "no story"?
Because Jerry had to tell me later.

645
00:33:18,506 --> 00:33:20,201
He couldn't believe it.

646
00:33:20,374 --> 00:33:23,673
I said... I said, "Get out of here.
No story?

647
00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:26,143
Is that what I said?"

648
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:33,643
Well, I informed him that he
was exceeding the speed limit...

649
00:33:33,821 --> 00:33:37,188
...and that's when he told me
that he was racing home...

650
00:33:37,358 --> 00:33:40,384
...because his friend was
about to commit suicide.

651
00:33:40,995 --> 00:33:42,326
And then what happened?

652
00:33:42,497 --> 00:33:44,158
He became very loud and hysterical.

653
00:33:44,332 --> 00:33:47,165
He was flailing his arms
about as he told the story...

654
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:49,565
...and then he threw himself
on the ground...

655
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,432
...and he grabbed me
around the legs...

656
00:33:51,606 --> 00:33:53,130
...and he begged me to let him go.

657
00:33:53,307 --> 00:33:55,104
And when I refused...

658
00:33:55,276 --> 00:33:58,245
...that's when he began to scream,
"My friend's going to die.

659
00:33:58,412 --> 00:33:59,640
My friend's going to die."

660
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:06,144
I don't know how you guys feel, but we
would like to be in business with you.

661
00:34:06,787 --> 00:34:09,119
- We would like to be in business.
- Love to be in business.

662
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,882
- We'll do business.
- Business.

663
00:34:11,058 --> 00:34:13,219
- Let's have business.
- This is business.

664
00:34:13,394 --> 00:34:17,626
Would it be possible to get
a copy of La Cocina?

665
00:34:20,134 --> 00:34:22,102
Your off-Broadway play.

666
00:34:24,672 --> 00:34:26,139
Gee, you know...

667
00:34:26,307 --> 00:34:28,605
It's... It's the damndest thing. l...

668
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:32,109
I moved recently,
and my files disappeared.

669
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,681
Now l... I don't know if
they fell off the truck...

670
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,375
...or if there was some foul play,
but let me tell you:

671
00:34:38,553 --> 00:34:40,578
I am not through with
that moving company.

672
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:42,689
That's my vow to you.

673
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,518
Well, I got a feeling about you two.

674
00:34:45,927 --> 00:34:47,417
And even more than that...

675
00:34:47,595 --> 00:34:50,120
...I place great confidence
in this lady's judgment.

676
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:51,697
- Good judgment.
- Good judgment.

677
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:54,767
- That's a pile of judgment.
- Yes. Yes, judgment with earrings on.

678
00:34:56,203 --> 00:34:59,536
So let's make a pilot.

679
00:35:02,777 --> 00:35:04,938
I had gone up to Westchester.

680
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,242
I go every Tuesday.

681
00:35:07,415 --> 00:35:10,248
I do charity work with the blind...

682
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:14,080
...in my spare time
for the Lighthouse.

683
00:35:14,255 --> 00:35:19,056
I was in the middle of a game of
Parcheesi with an old blind man...

684
00:35:19,226 --> 00:35:22,252
...and I excused myself
to call my friend...

685
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,625
...as he was very depressed lately...

686
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:26,391
...because he never
became a banker.

687
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:30,167
I don't understand.

688
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:33,364
You see, it had been his lifelong
dream to be a banker, and he...

689
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:35,736
Just the day before,
he was turned down by a bank.

690
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,276
I believe it was
the Manufacturers Hanover...

691
00:35:38,446 --> 00:35:40,812
...on Lexington and 40th Street.

692
00:35:40,982 --> 00:35:43,450
That was the third bank in
two weeks to turn him down...

693
00:35:43,618 --> 00:35:47,384
...so I was... I was a little concerned.
I wanted to see how he was doing.

694
00:35:47,555 --> 00:35:50,490
Well, Your Honor,
he was barely audible...

695
00:35:50,658 --> 00:35:52,888
...but l... I distinctly recall him saying...

696
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,721
Hey, Yo-Yo Ma.

697
00:35:58,132 --> 00:36:02,000
So I sped home to save my friend's life,
and I was stopped for speeding.

698
00:36:02,169 --> 00:36:05,138
Yes, I admit I was speeding...

699
00:36:05,306 --> 00:36:07,866
...but it was to save a man's life.

700
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:09,373
A close friend.

701
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:13,411
An innocent person who wanted
nothing more out of life than to love...

702
00:36:13,581 --> 00:36:15,913
...to be loved and to be a banker.

703
00:36:16,584 --> 00:36:18,381
So then he didn't kill himself?

704
00:36:18,753 --> 00:36:20,118
No, sir, he did not.

705
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:22,414
But only by the grace of God.

706
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:26,617
He is in the courtroom today,
sitting right over there!

707
00:36:26,994 --> 00:36:30,930
And he can corroborate
my entire testimony.

708
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:36,667
See! Told you! I told you!

709
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:40,635
- Now all we gotta do is write it.
- Yes!

710
00:36:40,808 --> 00:36:42,935
How are we gonna do that?

711
00:36:43,844 --> 00:36:45,937
- Hey! Congratulations.
- Thanks.

712
00:36:46,113 --> 00:36:47,603
- Thank you. Thanks.
- Thank you.

713
00:36:47,815 --> 00:36:49,715
You know, I thought
you were mad at me.

714
00:36:49,884 --> 00:36:52,045
Mr. Seinfeld, you have
a telephone call.

715
00:36:52,453 --> 00:36:55,547
Phone call? Who knows I'm here?

716
00:36:57,091 --> 00:37:00,083
Hello? Mom?

717
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,922
How did you know I was here?

718
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:06,794
Oh, I was not rude to him.
That is baloney!

719
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:12,001
I couldn't talk. I had a meeting.

720
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:17,201
I don't know. He... He went off
on some thing about pajamas.

721
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:21,177
When you sent me the bill, I thought
the show didn't have a chance.

722
00:37:21,348 --> 00:37:23,976
Oh, it was only vomit.

723
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:27,283
Anyway, I would like to pay
for the dry cleaning.

724
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:29,548
- Oh, no, no. It's okay.
- Oh, no, no, no.

725
00:37:29,724 --> 00:37:31,715
We all chipped in.
We have the money.

726
00:37:33,527 --> 00:37:35,427
Well, it was $ 18.

727
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:40,423
- Okay, $ 18. There it is. There you go.
- All right.

728
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:43,536
So maybe we could get
together this weekend.

729
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:45,839
- Yeah. Call me.
- All right. Great.

730
00:37:46,006 --> 00:37:47,496
- Bye.
- Bye. Thanks.

731
00:37:47,675 --> 00:37:49,040
Bye.

732
00:37:49,744 --> 00:37:52,645
I can't believe she took the money.

733
00:37:54,715 --> 00:37:55,943
Why?

734
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,081
I offered to pay.
She should have said no.

735
00:37:58,252 --> 00:38:00,243
She did. You insisted.

736
00:38:00,588 --> 00:38:03,614
This is what the pilot should be about.
Vomiting on somebody's vest.

737
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:06,552
How much are we gonna get for this?

738
00:38:06,761 --> 00:38:09,730
- Oh, l... I don't know.
- We gotta get 50. Gotta get 50.

739
00:38:09,897 --> 00:38:12,627
We'll go. You call your manager.
Maybe they made an offer.

740
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,268
- Okay.
- All right, let's go, let's go.

741
00:38:16,871 --> 00:38:18,498
Thirteen thousand?

742
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,136
Thirteen thousand.

743
00:38:20,407 --> 00:38:22,398
- Apiece?
- No, for both.

744
00:38:22,576 --> 00:38:26,672
That's insulting. Ted Danson
makes $800,000 an episode.

745
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:29,247
- Would you stop with the Ted Danson?
- Well, he does.

746
00:38:29,416 --> 00:38:30,974
- You're nuts.
- I'm sorry.

747
00:38:31,152 --> 00:38:34,417
I can't live knowing that Ted Danson
makes that much more than me.

748
00:38:34,588 --> 00:38:36,021
- Who's he?
- He's somebody.

749
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,418
- What about me?
- You're nobody.

750
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,718
- Why him? Why not me?
- He's good. You're not.

751
00:38:39,927 --> 00:38:42,487
- I'm better than him.
- You're worse.

752
00:38:42,663 --> 00:38:44,858
Much, much worse.

753
00:38:46,467 --> 00:38:47,866
- There's Davola.
- What? Where?

754
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:50,799
- Where?
- Outside. I just saw him outside.

755
00:38:57,344 --> 00:38:58,834
What is it?

756
00:38:59,313 --> 00:39:01,907
Oh, it's this patient.

757
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,108
Again?

758
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:06,048
I'm fairly certain.

759
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,712
I forgot to leave him an extra
prescription for his medication.

760
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:13,257
Well, so he can live without his
Valium for a couple of days.

761
00:39:13,427 --> 00:39:16,225
No, you don't understand.

762
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,558
He could be dangerous.

763
00:39:21,702 --> 00:39:23,363
Go outside and see if he's there.

764
00:39:23,537 --> 00:39:25,402
I can't go. He knows we're friends.

765
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:26,938
Well, what am I supposed to do?

766
00:39:27,107 --> 00:39:29,701
I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.

767
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,945
- Tell the cop.
- Good idea.

768
00:39:38,018 --> 00:39:39,280
Excuse me, officer.

769
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,956
There's a guy outside, and he's a
nutjob, and he's waiting to beat me up.

770
00:39:43,123 --> 00:39:46,320
If you could just walk me outside
and wait till I get into a cab.

771
00:39:47,027 --> 00:39:49,621
Yeah, all right. Just...
Just let me get a muffin.

772
00:39:50,197 --> 00:39:51,755
Thanks.

773
00:39:57,905 --> 00:40:00,271
He's gonna get a muffin.
Then he'll walk us outside.

774
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:02,841
This is a great way
to go through life, isn't it?

775
00:40:03,677 --> 00:40:05,941
Hey, he's looking at the menu now.

776
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,940
What's he looking at the menu for?

777
00:40:09,516 --> 00:40:11,711
I thought you said he was
gonna get a muffin.

778
00:40:19,293 --> 00:40:21,022
What are you doing?

779
00:40:22,496 --> 00:40:24,862
- What?
- What, you're ordering food now?

780
00:40:25,032 --> 00:40:27,466
Yeah. Yeah, I decided
to get a sandwich.

781
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:29,296
What happened to the muffin?

782
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,067
I got a little hungry.

783
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,231
All of a sudden you get hungry?

784
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:35,902
Yeah. You got a problem with that?

785
00:40:36,076 --> 00:40:37,373
No.

786
00:40:37,544 --> 00:40:40,069
Enjoy your lunch.

787
00:40:43,083 --> 00:40:45,108
You know, a muffin
can be very filling.

788
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:53,954
- He's getting a sandwich now.
- I thought he was gonna have a muffin.

789
00:40:54,128 --> 00:40:56,562
All of a sudden, he gets hungry.

790
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:59,932
- You know, a muffin can be very filling.
- I know.

791
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:03,628
Mr. Kramer...

792
00:41:05,406 --> 00:41:06,964
...you heard the testimony so far.

793
00:41:07,141 --> 00:41:09,473
Would you please tell the court,
in your own words...

794
00:41:09,643 --> 00:41:12,874
...what happened on the afternoon
of September 10th?

795
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,614
What do you mean,
"in my own words"?

796
00:41:15,783 --> 00:41:17,114
Whose words are they gonna be?

797
00:41:17,785 --> 00:41:19,548
You know what I mean.

798
00:41:20,087 --> 00:41:22,885
- I was very upset that day.
- And why was that?

799
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:26,152
- Would you let me say...? Let me talk.
- All right. Go ahead.

800
00:41:26,327 --> 00:41:27,988
- All right.
- Okay.

801
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:33,497
I was very upset that day because
I could never become a banker.

802
00:41:34,234 --> 00:41:37,897
And this failure to become a banker...

803
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:41,606
...was eating at you. Eating, eating,
eating at you inside.

804
00:41:42,343 --> 00:41:43,810
Yeah.

805
00:41:45,846 --> 00:41:49,714
It was your family that pushed you into
banking. It was their dream for you.

806
00:41:49,883 --> 00:41:51,748
- Mr. Newman?
- I'm trying to establish...

807
00:41:51,919 --> 00:41:55,082
...Mr. Kramer's fragile emotional state.
My entire case depends on it.

808
00:41:56,523 --> 00:41:57,785
Continue.

809
00:41:57,992 --> 00:42:00,756
- As you were saying, Mr. Kramer?
- What was the question?

810
00:42:01,028 --> 00:42:03,826
You're telling how your parents
pushed you into banking.

811
00:42:04,531 --> 00:42:06,465
Well, my father, when I was a kid...

812
00:42:06,633 --> 00:42:08,294
...he took me to the bank...

813
00:42:08,469 --> 00:42:11,802
...and he lifted me up, and he pointed
to the teller, and he said:

814
00:42:11,972 --> 00:42:14,133
"Sonny boy, take a good look
at him.

815
00:42:14,308 --> 00:42:16,538
That's gonna be you someday."

816
00:42:17,111 --> 00:42:22,242
But you never became a banker,
did you, Mr. Kramer?

817
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:25,214
Why? Why did you fail?

818
00:42:25,386 --> 00:42:27,217
I don't know.

819
00:42:27,388 --> 00:42:28,878
Because you hated your father...

820
00:42:29,056 --> 00:42:31,047
...and you would do anything
to displease him!

821
00:42:31,225 --> 00:42:32,783
Isn't that true?

822
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,552
- Could you get to the speeding?
- Yes, I intend to, Your Honor.

823
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,699
And then, on the afternoon
of September 10th...

824
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:42,392
...you received a phone call,
did you not?

825
00:42:43,003 --> 00:42:45,028
Phone call?

826
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,201
Yes, a phone call.

827
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:49,873
From who?

828
00:42:50,477 --> 00:42:52,104
- From me.
- From you?

829
00:42:52,379 --> 00:42:54,847
Yes, from me! From me!
I called you, remember?

830
00:42:55,015 --> 00:42:57,483
- You called me?
- Yes, I called you, you idiot!

831
00:42:57,651 --> 00:42:59,278
Because you were going to...

832
00:42:59,453 --> 00:43:01,216
- You were going to... Remember?
- What?

833
00:43:01,388 --> 00:43:02,855
You were gonna... You were gonna...

834
00:43:03,023 --> 00:43:04,888
You were gonna do something...

835
00:43:06,326 --> 00:43:08,385
...to yourself.
You were gonna do something.

836
00:43:08,562 --> 00:43:11,326
Remember the banking! The banking!
It wasn't working out.

837
00:43:11,598 --> 00:43:13,429
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call...

838
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:15,067
- Yes, a banker!
- What banker?

839
00:43:15,235 --> 00:43:16,827
You're a banker!

840
00:43:18,005 --> 00:43:19,529
- Your Honor...
- That's enough, Mr...

841
00:43:19,706 --> 00:43:21,640
Mr. Kramer is obviously
very distraught.

842
00:43:21,809 --> 00:43:23,970
- I'm distraught?
- You shut up!

843
00:43:27,247 --> 00:43:29,579
I demand a recess so that
I can take him outside...

844
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,411
...and help him regain
his composure.

845
00:43:31,618 --> 00:43:33,586
That'll be $ 75.

846
00:43:33,754 --> 00:43:37,019
What's the matter with you, you jerk?
We had it all worked out!

847
00:43:42,863 --> 00:43:44,296
Is he out there? Do you see him?

848
00:43:44,598 --> 00:43:46,031
I'm not sure.

849
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,630
Well, either you see him or you don't.

850
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:51,904
All right, I don't.

851
00:43:54,441 --> 00:43:56,500
What is he doing?

852
00:43:56,877 --> 00:43:58,367
Is he getting coffee?

853
00:43:59,346 --> 00:44:01,974
I think he's getting coffee.

854
00:44:02,149 --> 00:44:04,310
What's with this guy?

855
00:44:07,754 --> 00:44:09,278
Did you just order coffee?

856
00:44:11,225 --> 00:44:13,284
- Yeah.
- This is really too much.

857
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,787
- What is your problem?
- I'm sitting over there...

858
00:44:15,963 --> 00:44:18,022
...waiting for you to finish
for 20 minutes.

859
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:20,894
Now you're drinking coffee.
That's another 10 minutes.

860
00:44:21,468 --> 00:44:24,232
Well, you're just gonna have to wait.

861
00:44:24,771 --> 00:44:26,602
You never said anything
about the banking.

862
00:44:26,773 --> 00:44:28,866
- You're off your rocker!
- Hey, you guys.

863
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:30,373
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

864
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:32,569
- What are you doing here?
- Is Davola outside?

865
00:44:32,813 --> 00:44:34,041
- Davola?
- Yeah.

866
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:36,079
- No, I didn't see him.
- Crazy Joe Davola?

867
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,912
- Jerry, yours is $ 11.
- Eleven dollars? For what?

868
00:44:39,086 --> 00:44:40,519
Muffin, sandwich and coffee.

869
00:44:42,289 --> 00:44:44,757
Hey, NBC okayed our idea.
We're gonna make the pilot.

870
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:46,289
The circus freak show?

871
00:44:46,527 --> 00:44:48,051
- No.
- A pilot?

872
00:44:48,228 --> 00:44:51,527
What do you make for something
like that? Fifty, 60 thousand?

873
00:44:52,499 --> 00:44:54,626
What's the difference?
The money's not important.

874
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:58,128
- Hey, Newman, is that your red car?
- Yeah.

875
00:44:58,305 --> 00:45:00,102
- I think you're getting a ticket.
- Run.

876
00:45:00,274 --> 00:45:02,265
- Go! Go! Go!
- Hey, what are you doing?

877
00:45:02,442 --> 00:45:05,070
It's after 6:00!
You can't give me a ticket!

878
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:07,611
You're not gonna get away with this.
I'll fight this.

879
00:45:07,781 --> 00:45:10,477
- I've got witnesses.
- I saw the whole thing.

880
00:45:10,951 --> 00:45:12,851
This would be a good idea
for the pilot.

881
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,885
Get out of here.
The vomiting is funnier.

882
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,350
Oh, like you know.

883
00:45:16,523 --> 00:45:17,820
No. You do.

884
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:21,392
Many states now have traffic school
when you have an infraction.

885
00:45:21,562 --> 00:45:23,427
I went to traffic school.
I didn't mind it.

886
00:45:23,597 --> 00:45:25,087
I felt bad for the instructor.

887
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:29,634
This guy goes to traffic school
every day, no matter how he drives.

888
00:45:29,803 --> 00:45:32,067
What is his incentive to not speed?

889
00:45:32,472 --> 00:45:34,997
He's going to traffic school, anyway.

890
00:45:35,676 --> 00:45:38,474
Why not get a racecar, do 200 miles
an hour down the street?

891
00:45:38,645 --> 00:45:41,705
Cop stops you. "Where you going?"
"Traffic school." "Go ahead.

892
00:45:41,882 --> 00:45:44,009
And you better hurry.
You really need it."

893
00:45:45,352 --> 00:45:50,289
The punishment should be, instead of
traffic school or traffic court, just traffic.

894
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:54,325
They sentence you
to 100 hours of traffic.

895
00:45:54,494 --> 00:45:56,519
Five people drive all around you...

896
00:45:56,697 --> 00:45:59,359
...at five miles an hour
wherever you go.

897
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,068
You're on your way to Vegas.
There isn't a car in sight.

898
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:04,860
Come on, move it.
