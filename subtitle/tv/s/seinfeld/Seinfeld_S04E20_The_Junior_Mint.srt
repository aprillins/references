1
00:00:03,817 --> 00:00:05,045
A friend's getting married.

2
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:08,677
The bachelor party and bridal shower
are the same day, so it's conceivable...

3
00:00:08,856 --> 00:00:10,653
...that while she's getting lingerie...

4
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:13,725
...he'll be at a nude bar
watching a dancer in the same outfit.

5
00:00:14,795 --> 00:00:17,161
That is possible.

6
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:19,492
But the difference between
single and married...

7
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:21,032
...is the form of government.

8
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:24,136
You see, when you're single
you're the dictator of your own life.

9
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:25,465
I have complete power.

10
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:28,904
When I give the order to fall asleep
on the sofa with the TV on...

11
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:31,567
...no one can overrule me.

12
00:00:32,313 --> 00:00:36,306
When you're married you are part
of a vast decision-making body.

13
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:38,383
Before anything's done,
there are meetings.

14
00:00:38,552 --> 00:00:40,452
Committees have to study
the situation.

15
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:42,816
And this is if the marriage works.

16
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:44,685
That's what so painful about divorce:

17
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:47,292
You've been impeached.
You weren't even the president.

18
00:00:54,268 --> 00:00:57,032
Hey, is it my imagination,
or do really good-looking women...

19
00:00:57,204 --> 00:00:59,764
...walk a lot faster
than everybody else?

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,874
We don't walk that fast.

21
00:01:02,042 --> 00:01:05,603
- No, seriously.
- Seriously, we don't.

22
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:09,242
The better-looking they are,
the faster they go.

23
00:01:09,416 --> 00:01:11,316
I see them on the street
zooming around.

24
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:14,283
They're a blur. It's like they got
a motor on their ass.

25
00:01:16,624 --> 00:01:19,821
Hey, Jerry, come on, let's go.
We're gonna miss the previews.

26
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:21,222
What's the big hurry?

27
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:23,955
How we getting to Scott Drake's
party on Saturday night?

28
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:26,656
Oh, Drake's party.
I forgot to buy a present.

29
00:01:26,834 --> 00:01:28,301
What, I gotta buy a present now?

30
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:30,403
Of course you do.
It's an engagement party.

31
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:32,835
It never ends, this present stuff.

32
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:34,938
Engagement present.
Then they get married.

33
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:36,440
You gotta get them something.

34
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,975
Then a baby. Another present.

35
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:40,170
Then the baby starts getting
their presents.

36
00:01:40,347 --> 00:01:41,712
I don't even like Drake.

37
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:43,611
- Don't like the Drake?
- Hate the Drake.

38
00:01:43,784 --> 00:01:46,218
- I love the Drake.
- How could you not like the Drake?

39
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:48,480
- Who's the Drake?
- Who's the Drake?

40
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:50,749
The Drake is good.

41
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:52,857
So, what are you gonna get him?

42
00:01:53,027 --> 00:01:55,052
You know, I haven't even
met the fiancée.

43
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,356
Oh, whatever!

44
00:01:58,732 --> 00:02:00,757
Elaine, look.
I drew this triangle freehand.

45
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:03,266
It's a doodle. It's perfect.

46
00:02:04,304 --> 00:02:05,737
So what? That's easy.

47
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:07,498
Easy?

48
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,715
Hi. Hey, have you gotten
a present yet for the Drake?

49
00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:17,783
- No, no, not yet.
- You like the Drake?

50
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:19,851
I love the Drake.

51
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:22,785
I'm looking forward to meeting
the "Drakette."

52
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:24,890
I'm lukewarm about the Drakette.

53
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:27,789
Boy, that's a nice triangle.

54
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:31,395
It's isosceles.

55
00:02:31,732 --> 00:02:34,633
Isosceles. You know,
I love the name "Isosceles."

56
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:37,532
If I had a kid, I would
name him Isosceles.

57
00:02:37,705 --> 00:02:40,469
Isosceles Kramer.

58
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,742
Hey, you know what, maybe
we should all chip in for the gift.

59
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:46,004
- The chip-in.
- Hey, pretty good idea?

60
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,307
- Yeah.
- The chip-in. Definitely.

61
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:50,973
Let's go to that mall in Lynbrook
before the party.

62
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:54,450
- We'll take your car. It's got room.
- No, no. My car's not running.

63
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:56,386
What about your father's car?

64
00:02:56,557 --> 00:02:58,718
No. Out of the question.
I was over there today.

65
00:02:58,892 --> 00:03:01,258
He's got the good spot
in front of the good building.

66
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:03,896
I know he's not gonna
want to move.

67
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,658
- Are you serious?
- You don't know what it means to him.

68
00:03:06,834 --> 00:03:09,803
Once he gets it, he doesn't
go out for weeks.

69
00:03:10,037 --> 00:03:12,232
How about this:
You put your car in the good spot.

70
00:03:12,406 --> 00:03:15,102
That'll hold the good spot,
and we can get the good car.

71
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:17,766
- Good thinking.
- Good to meet you.

72
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,006
- So, what are we gonna get him?
- Anything we want. We're chipping in.

73
00:03:22,182 --> 00:03:24,343
I like this area. I could live out here.

74
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:27,248
Yeah, we ought to all get a house
and live together out here.

75
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:29,446
That's a good idea.
Tell you what, chuckles...

76
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:32,353
...l'll give you permission
to sublet my room right now.

77
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:34,861
Look at this.
There's no spaces here.

78
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,190
- Excuse me. You getting out?
- No.

79
00:03:37,631 --> 00:03:39,963
Why don't you take
the handicapped spot?

80
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:43,163
- You think?
- No, no. We'll find a space.

81
00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:46,170
- There's spaces in the other lot.
- I don't wanna walk that far.

82
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,365
What if a handicapped person
needs it?

83
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:51,170
- No, come on, they don't drive.
- Yes, they do.

84
00:03:51,478 --> 00:03:54,970
Have you ever seen a handicapped
person pull into a space and park?

85
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:56,876
The space is there,
they must drive.

86
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,349
No, they don't. If they could drive,
they wouldn't be handicapped.

87
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:02,853
So if you can drive,
you're not handicapped?

88
00:04:03,023 --> 00:04:05,355
We're not gonna be long.
We gotta get to the party.

89
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:08,620
I got news for you: Handicapped
people don't even want to park there.

90
00:04:08,796 --> 00:04:10,957
They want to be treated
just like everybody else.

91
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:12,996
That's why those spaces
are always empty.

92
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:15,761
He's right. It's the same thing
with the feminists.

93
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:17,995
They want everything to be equal.
Everything.

94
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:20,163
But when the check comes,
where are they?

95
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:23,766
What does that mean?

96
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:25,708
Yeah.

97
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,904
- All right, I'm pulling in.
- Go ahead, George.

98
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:31,448
- George!
- Come on. It's five minutes.

99
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,047
Don't forget where
the car is parked.

100
00:04:35,222 --> 00:04:37,690
- Don't worry.
- We'll remember.

101
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:42,423
Do you believe the deal
we got on this?

102
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:45,326
- A big-screen TV at that price?
- What a sale, huh?

103
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:47,933
And how about that store
delivering it tonight.

104
00:04:48,101 --> 00:04:49,796
We're gonna be swimming
in thank-yous.

105
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,437
Why did I get the veggieburger?

106
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:54,938
You got a veggieburger, so I got one.
It's like eating a loaf of crumbs.

107
00:04:55,108 --> 00:04:57,668
No one's gonna have a better gift
than this big-screen TV.

108
00:04:57,845 --> 00:04:59,574
Good for them. Love the Drake.

109
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:03,182
Got to love the Drake.

110
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,751
Hey, what's going on over here?

111
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:10,446
There must have been an accident.

112
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,784
What's going on?

113
00:05:14,962 --> 00:05:17,226
Some jerk parked
in the handicapped spot...

114
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:20,230
...so this woman in a wheelchair
had to wheel up this incline.

115
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,530
Halfway up, her batteries gave out,
and she rolled backwards into the wall.

116
00:05:25,138 --> 00:05:26,935
Had to take her to Saint Elizabeth's.

117
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:28,734
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.

118
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:31,377
We're just waiting for the owner
of this car to show up.

119
00:05:31,545 --> 00:05:33,445
He may not get out alive.

120
00:05:33,614 --> 00:05:37,141
Taking up a handicapped spot.
He's gonna pay.

121
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:39,877
Sons of bitches.

122
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:43,420
Well, good luck finding them.
Him. Whatever.

123
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:46,718
I'd like to get my hands on him myself,
but I gotta take off.

124
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:48,486
We're gonna get you, you coward!

125
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:53,028
- They'll kill us.
- You happy? Are you happy now?

126
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,361
- How long you think they'll be here?
- Don't know.

127
00:05:55,535 --> 00:05:56,934
What about the party,
the Drake?

128
00:05:57,104 --> 00:05:59,197
- Oh, screw the Drake!
- I love the Drake.

129
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:01,204
Let's just take a bus
back into the city.

130
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,637
I can't leave the car here.

131
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:05,141
- Why not?
- It's my father's car.

132
00:06:05,312 --> 00:06:07,143
- Let's smash it!
- Yeah!

133
00:06:07,314 --> 00:06:09,407
Hey, hey! Leave the car alone!

134
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:12,916
All right, let's get out of here.
We gotta figure something out.

135
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:16,145
What are we gonna do?
How will we get out?

136
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:18,450
Even if we go to the car
and they're not there...

137
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,252
...how do we know
they're not hiding?

138
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:23,590
They have to give up some time.
They can't stay out there all night.

139
00:06:23,764 --> 00:06:25,322
What are we, John Dillinger?

140
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:27,797
How did this get to be
the crime of the century?

141
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:31,597
It's not like we stuck a broomstick
in her spokes and she went flying.

142
00:06:32,572 --> 00:06:35,234
What I don't get is, just because
the batteries went dead...

143
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:38,435
...you'd think she'd be able to
roll it up the hill with her hands.

144
00:06:38,612 --> 00:06:39,840
You'd think.

145
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:42,447
Batteries have gone dead before.
Aren't they prepared?

146
00:06:42,616 --> 00:06:44,811
You know, most of them
don't even have batteries.

147
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:47,317
Must have been a rich, spoiled
handicapped person...

148
00:06:47,487 --> 00:06:49,114
...who didn't want to do any work.

149
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:51,780
Just wanted to sit in her wheelchair
and take it easy.

150
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,223
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm sorry.

151
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:57,363
Our big-screen TV is probably
arriving just about now.

152
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:59,123
How we getting out?
We need a plan.

153
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,959
I got it. We'll give the keys to Elaine.

154
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:03,727
- Me?
- Yeah.

155
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:06,304
You're a woman.
Men won't hit a woman.

156
00:07:06,473 --> 00:07:08,065
Oh, they won't?

157
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:10,334
Not if they don't know you.

158
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:12,644
I'm not going for this.
Kramer should go.

159
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:14,178
You know, it was all his idea.

160
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:16,316
No chance in hell.

161
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:18,348
What if we created
some sort of diversion?

162
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:20,418
What if we went over
and started screaming:

163
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,953
"There's the guy that took
the handicapped spot."

164
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:25,648
When they run the other direction,
we'll jump in the car.

165
00:07:25,826 --> 00:07:27,384
- That's good.
- Let's give it a try.

166
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:30,029
If that doesn't work,
we'll give them Kramer.

167
00:07:46,213 --> 00:07:48,238
Oh, my God.

168
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:07,592
You know, a lot of these scratches
will buff right out.

169
00:08:12,672 --> 00:08:15,869
Eight years I had that car,
not a scratch on it.

170
00:08:16,043 --> 00:08:17,533
Eight years.

171
00:08:17,711 --> 00:08:19,736
- Two crack.
- Three dot.

172
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:23,747
Beautiful Mercury.
I special ordered that bench seat.

173
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,477
Dad, this other car cut us off.

174
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:29,213
They had swastikas all over it.

175
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:32,415
They were hurling
racial epithets at us.

176
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:35,425
- I could have been killed.
- I told you not to give it to him.

177
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:38,189
- Three crack.
- Four bam.

178
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:40,890
You know, my insurance
doesn't even cover this.

179
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:42,558
The whole thing is a total loss.

180
00:08:42,736 --> 00:08:44,829
The important thing
is he didn't get hurt.

181
00:08:45,005 --> 00:08:46,563
No, it isn't.

182
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:49,969
So, what are you doing now,
Georgie?

183
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:54,239
- North.
- I'm writing a pilot for NBC.

184
00:08:54,414 --> 00:08:56,974
- Where the hell's my paper?
- You're writing a pilot?

185
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,176
With his friend Jerry Seinfeld,
the comedian.

186
00:09:00,353 --> 00:09:01,843
So, what's it about?

187
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:07,425
Well, Jerry's car gets hit and the other
driver doesn't have any insurance...

188
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:09,994
...so the judge sentences him
to be Jerry's butler.

189
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:12,188
- It's the same situation.
- Exactly.

190
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:14,833
Frank, maybe you ought to
make him your butler.

191
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:17,828
Flower.

192
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:21,496
Every time you're with that Kramer
something happens.

193
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:24,838
- He's a real troublemaker.
- He didn't have anything to do with it.

194
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:27,445
He's all together crazy, that one.

195
00:09:27,614 --> 00:09:30,777
And Jerry I used to think was nice.

196
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:33,647
I don't know what happened to him.
Nine bam.

197
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,617
- One dot.
- Two crack.

198
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:38,121
- Three bam.
- Mahjongg.

199
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,791
So it was a good party, huh?

200
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:45,022
You're welcome. You're welcome.
They loved the TV. Loved it.

201
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:46,426
Yeah.

202
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,329
Wait. I'll ask her.
That's a great idea.

203
00:09:48,502 --> 00:09:51,835
Drake wants to know if we'll come out
to Mineola since we missed the party.

204
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,336
- Get something to eat.
- Sure.

205
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:55,532
Sure. Okay.

206
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,700
Don't worry, I'm taking my car.

207
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:00,645
Okay. All right,
we'll see you later. Bye.

208
00:10:00,814 --> 00:10:02,076
The Drake is great.

209
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:05,311
He's so nice.
Man, I'm really happy for them.

210
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:07,544
Yeah. Well, I don't know
if I'm happy for them.

211
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:11,157
I'm glad they're happy, but frankly
it doesn't do anything for me.

212
00:10:15,262 --> 00:10:16,559
- Yes?
- It's me.

213
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,561
Come on up.

214
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,658
Hey.

215
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:26,398
I just came from Saint Elizabeth's.

216
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:28,200
Saint Elizabeth's Hospital? Why?

217
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:31,369
Well, the handicapped woman,
I went to see her.

218
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:32,944
- You went to see her?
- Yeah.

219
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:34,910
Wow, what happened?

220
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:37,208
I'm in love.

221
00:10:39,286 --> 00:10:40,514
- What?
- Yeah.

222
00:10:40,687 --> 00:10:43,713
She is the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.

223
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,915
I love her, Jerry.
I mean, I really love her.

224
00:10:46,092 --> 00:10:47,684
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

225
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:51,194
She's got everything I've always
wanted in another human being.

226
00:10:51,364 --> 00:10:53,423
Except for the walking.

227
00:10:55,502 --> 00:10:58,232
What's the difference.
You don't go out that much.

228
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,405
- I'm glad you're here.
- Why?

229
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:03,600
We gotta go out,
we gotta buy a wheelchair.

230
00:11:03,777 --> 00:11:05,039
A wheelchair? What for?

231
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:07,237
I went to the hospital today.
I saw the woman.

232
00:11:07,414 --> 00:11:09,939
The wheelchair is totaled.
We gotta get her another one.

233
00:11:10,617 --> 00:11:11,879
Doesn't she have collision?

234
00:11:12,052 --> 00:11:15,317
George, I'm in love with her.

235
00:11:16,156 --> 00:11:18,351
Look, my father works
for the United Volunteers.

236
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:20,925
- Maybe he can get her one.
- No. She needs it now.

237
00:11:21,094 --> 00:11:23,392
What about these two?
Aren't they gonna chip in?

238
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:25,656
Hey, we told you not to park there.

239
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:27,424
Can't we just fix the old one?

240
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:30,092
All right, all right.
Fine, George, don't chip in.

241
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,965
But some day we'll be
driving along...

242
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:35,574
...we're gonna look out the window,
see her crawling along Fifth Avenue.

243
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:38,802
- Is that what you want?
- All right! All right!

244
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:40,970
We'll buy a wheelchair.

245
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:45,277
Wheelchairs. Engagement presents.
It never ends!

246
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:52,387
This is our best model,
the Cougar 9000.

247
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,925
It's the Rolls-Royce
of wheelchairs.

248
00:11:55,795 --> 00:12:00,323
This is like you're almost glad
to be handicapped.

249
00:12:03,737 --> 00:12:05,432
So, now, what's this got?

250
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:09,132
It's got inductive joystick,
dynamic braking, flip-up arms.

251
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:10,537
It's fully loaded.

252
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:15,104
I put Stephen Hawking in one of these
two months ago, he's loving it.

253
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:19,281
It's rated number one by Hospital
Supply and Prosthetic Magazine.

254
00:12:19,452 --> 00:12:22,319
- How much?
- Sixty-two hundred.

255
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,684
Do you have something
a little more...

256
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,919
...less expensive?

257
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:34,699
- Hi! How you doing?
- Hey, Drake.

258
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:36,665
- Hi, Drake!
- Hi, Allison.

259
00:12:36,836 --> 00:12:38,565
There's the TV.
Elaine, look at this.

260
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:40,501
Oh, my God, this is fantastic.

261
00:12:40,674 --> 00:12:43,336
So tell me, were you guys
just blown away or what?

262
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,876
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's fantastic.

263
00:12:46,046 --> 00:12:48,071
I am gonna make good use of this.

264
00:12:48,248 --> 00:12:52,150
I'm watching every Super Bowl here.
Every big fight.

265
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:56,312
Oh, man, there is nothing
like a really big TV, huh?

266
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:58,320
So, where are we eating?

267
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:02,222
- Well, actually, Jerry...
- I'm really hungry.

268
00:13:02,395 --> 00:13:04,260
We just broke up.

269
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:18,237
- When did this happen?
- About 20 minutes ago.

270
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:25,680
Hey, I am really sorry
about this, guys.

271
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:31,853
- Hell of a picture on this thing.
- Crystal clear.

272
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:35,525
They know how to make them.

273
00:13:37,664 --> 00:13:39,188
Drake?

274
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:42,659
Are there any good Italian restaurants
around here?

275
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,601
Gagliano's. That's pretty good.

276
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:50,872
- Well, we should...
- Get moving. Yeah.

277
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:54,275
Hey, Drake, whatever happens,
I'm sure it'll be for the best.

278
00:13:54,447 --> 00:13:57,939
Yeah. Take it easy.
Bye-bye, Allison.

279
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,985
The remote.

280
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:08,124
Okay, I'm just gonna put it
on top of the television...

281
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:10,626
Oh, God!

282
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,164
This one's about 8 years old.
Not a scratch on it.

283
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:17,598
It was owned by some lady...

284
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:20,262
...who only used it to go
to the kitchen to feed her cats.

285
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:22,672
- But this will get you around?
- Oh, sure.

286
00:14:22,842 --> 00:14:25,242
It just doesn't have any of the frills
of the Cougar.

287
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:27,972
- Like what?
- For example, your tremor-damping.

288
00:14:28,148 --> 00:14:31,015
- Now, what's that?
- It helps to control the direction...

289
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:33,982
...regardless of the operator's tremors
or "spasticity."

290
00:14:34,154 --> 00:14:36,782
- Well, is it all right if I try it?
- Hop in.

291
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:40,249
Oh, yeah.

292
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:44,319
I tell you...

293
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:48,664
...when I see someone
enjoying themselves like that...

294
00:14:48,835 --> 00:14:51,895
...it reminds me of why I got
into this business in the first place.

295
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:53,936
How much?

296
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:56,302
How about $240?

297
00:14:56,843 --> 00:14:58,333
- We'll take it.
- We'll take it.

298
00:15:00,513 --> 00:15:04,609
- Drake gave her the TV?
- Gave her all the gifts. He felt guilty.

299
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:08,112
Well, she can't keep it.
It's not fair. That's our TV.

300
00:15:08,288 --> 00:15:10,188
I know it is!

301
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:15,053
Boy, I'm really starting to
dislike the Drake.

302
00:15:15,395 --> 00:15:17,295
Hate the Drake!

303
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:20,129
Maybe the whole thing
was a scam.

304
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:23,027
Anybody can just get engaged,
get presents, and keep them.

305
00:15:23,203 --> 00:15:26,604
Maybe they're on the way to Chicago
to do the whole thing all over again.

306
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,167
They don't know anybody in Chicago.

307
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:33,335
Don't worry, they'll make friends fast
with that nice TV.

308
00:15:34,914 --> 00:15:36,381
- Hey.
- Hey. Guess what?

309
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:37,811
The Drake broke up.

310
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:39,982
The Drake broke up!

311
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:41,677
That's fantastic!

312
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:45,018
We'll get the TV back. Help defray
some of the cost of the wheelchair.

313
00:15:45,191 --> 00:15:47,989
- I don't know about defraying.
- Why?

314
00:15:48,161 --> 00:15:50,391
We're not getting that TV.

315
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:52,690
What? The engagement's off.
We get the TV back.

316
00:15:52,866 --> 00:15:54,094
That's business.

317
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,064
The Drakette took it.

318
00:15:56,236 --> 00:15:58,101
She can't take it.

319
00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,898
It's not hers. It's theirs.

320
00:16:00,073 --> 00:16:03,531
Once there's no theirs,
there's no hers. It should be ours.

321
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:05,544
Well, she has it.

322
00:16:06,479 --> 00:16:09,846
I told you the Drake was bad.
I hate the Drake!

323
00:16:12,085 --> 00:16:13,177
Maybe we should call her.

324
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,318
- Oh, come on. Who's gonna call?
- You are.

325
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:19,356
What? Why is it me who
always has to do these things?

326
00:16:19,526 --> 00:16:21,619
Because that's your thing.

327
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:23,193
Calling people I hardly know...

328
00:16:23,363 --> 00:16:25,456
...and demanding they return
expensive gifts?

329
00:16:25,632 --> 00:16:27,224
That's my thing?

330
00:16:28,301 --> 00:16:30,166
Yeah, that's your thing.

331
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:34,662
All right. Give me the phone.

332
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:37,942
That's my thing.

333
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:44,143
You know, I'm thinking
about getting a yo-yo.

334
00:16:44,551 --> 00:16:45,950
- Really?
- Yeah.

335
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:48,053
I could see that.

336
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,353
- Hello?
- Allison. Hi, this is Elaine.

337
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,495
I gave all the gifts to charity.

338
00:16:56,663 --> 00:16:59,655
Oh, okay. Well, thanks a lot.

339
00:16:59,832 --> 00:17:01,527
Sorry again about you
and the Drake.

340
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:04,329
- I hate the Drake.
- Everybody does.

341
00:17:04,504 --> 00:17:06,563
Bye-bye.

342
00:17:06,739 --> 00:17:11,506
- She gave it to charity.
- Charity? That's appalling.

343
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:15,447
How could anybody be
so selfish and inconsiderate.

344
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:18,681
Hey. Well, I gave her
the wheelchair.

345
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:20,819
You should have seen
the look on her face.

346
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:24,479
Then she told me the old wheelchair
wasn't any good anyway.

347
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:29,219
So you see, George, the whole
incident was a God blessing. Yeah.

348
00:17:30,463 --> 00:17:34,194
- You mean a blessing in disguise?
- Yeah.

349
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:38,066
I would also like to
take this time...

350
00:17:38,237 --> 00:17:42,196
...to personally thank
our gracious host, Frank Costanza...

351
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:46,401
...who earned the Silver Circle Award
and is our unanimous choice...

352
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:49,810
...for the United Volunteer
representative of the month.

353
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:55,888
Due to his tireless effort, he has
personally raised over $22,000.

354
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:58,615
And that's a lot of wheelchairs.

355
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,521
On behalf of the United Volunteers
of New York, we thank you.

356
00:18:04,697 --> 00:18:07,063
Thank you very much.

357
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,700
Mr. Costanza?

358
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:10,699
- Yes?
- You're under arrest.

359
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,497
Under arrest? What for?

360
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:15,140
Reckless endangerment
of public safety...

361
00:18:15,308 --> 00:18:18,300
...in violation of traffic code 342-A.

362
00:18:19,245 --> 00:18:23,306
- What's that?
- Parking in a handicap spot.

363
00:18:23,716 --> 00:18:25,308
Let's go.

364
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:27,817
George! George!

365
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,018
Your father got arrested.
For what?

366
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,717
Parking in a handicapped spot.

367
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:39,160
Right in the middle
of his United Volunteer's meeting.

368
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:42,824
When he got back, he chased
after me with a baseball bat.

369
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:44,900
Holy...

370
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:48,006
Between the car being totaled,
the towing charge and the fine...

371
00:18:48,174 --> 00:18:50,108
...there's no way I could ever
pay him back.

372
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:51,607
So, what are you gonna do?

373
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:54,813
I agreed to become his butler.

374
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:58,013
What?

375
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:02,587
- What's the matter?
- It's over.

376
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:07,351
- What's over?
- Me and Lola.

377
00:19:07,927 --> 00:19:10,122
- Who we bought the wheelchair for?
- She dumped me.

378
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:11,854
- She dumped you?
- She dumped me.

379
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:14,295
She rolled right over me.

380
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:19,597
Said I was a hipster doofus.

381
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,433
Am I a hipster doofus?

382
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:23,403
- No.
- No.

383
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:25,168
Said I'm not good-looking enough.

384
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:28,802
Not good-looking.
Jerry, look at me. Look at my face.

385
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:31,950
Am I beautiful?
George, am I beautiful?

386
00:19:35,688 --> 00:19:38,316
- You're very attractive.
- Yeah.

387
00:19:38,491 --> 00:19:41,654
She says she doesn't want to
see me again. Told me to drop dead!

388
00:19:41,828 --> 00:19:45,389
- Drop dead.
- Boy, even I never heard that one.

389
00:19:45,565 --> 00:19:47,396
She's pretty rough.

390
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:51,333
Well, we just blew
$240 on a wheelchair.

391
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:55,270
- $240 bucks?
- Well, it was slightly used.

392
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:57,466
Used?

393
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:10,887
I don't think you did
such a good job on these.

394
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:15,987
- What?
- Supposed to see your face there.

395
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:19,493
Do you see your face in there?

396
00:20:24,237 --> 00:20:25,602
Yeah.

397
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,473
Oh, really?

398
00:20:31,344 --> 00:20:34,006
How about that.
Went right down a hill?

399
00:20:34,514 --> 00:20:38,280
Okay. All right. Bye.

400
00:20:38,451 --> 00:20:41,852
George, forget about the shoes.
I want you to do something for me.

401
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:44,683
This handicapped woman
had an accident.

402
00:20:44,857 --> 00:20:48,657
Somebody gave her a used wheelchair
with defective brakes.

403
00:20:48,828 --> 00:20:50,989
Sons of bitches!

404
00:20:51,164 --> 00:20:54,133
Pick up this big-screen TV
and deliver it to her.

405
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,666
- Big-screen TV.
- You think you can handle it?

406
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:04,308
- Yes?
- Hi, we're from the United Volunteers.

407
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:06,342
We've come to pick up the TV.

408
00:21:06,512 --> 00:21:08,742
Great, it's right over there.

409
00:21:08,915 --> 00:21:10,746
It's a big one.

410
00:21:16,656 --> 00:21:19,090
- Who's got the receipt?
- I do.

411
00:21:19,258 --> 00:21:21,783
- Will they give us cash?
- That's their policy.

412
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:24,987
I hate this mall. There are never
any spaces here.

413
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:27,189
Why don't you park
in front of the hydrant?

414
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:31,735
- What if there's a fire?
- Now what are the chances of that?

415
00:21:42,381 --> 00:21:47,717
The handicapped parking spot
is the mirage of the parking desert.

416
00:21:47,887 --> 00:21:50,617
Do you know that feeling?
You see it there in the distance.

417
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,224
You can't believe your eyes.
It's too good to be true.

418
00:21:53,392 --> 00:21:55,053
It's a big wide spot
by the entrance.

419
00:21:55,228 --> 00:21:57,594
Somehow everybody missed it.

420
00:22:01,601 --> 00:22:07,562
What is the handicapped parking
situation at the Special Olympics?

421
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:15,210
They must have to just stack, like,
a hundred cars into those two spots.

422
00:22:15,381 --> 00:22:17,906
How else are they gonna do it?
