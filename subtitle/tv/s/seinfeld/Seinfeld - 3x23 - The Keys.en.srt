1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,242
I bought the Ginsu knife.

2
00:00:04,711 --> 00:00:06,663
I did buy the Ginsu knife.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:09,962
I know, you can't believe it,
but I did, I swear. I saw it.

4
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:11,461
It was late, I'm watching...

5
00:00:11,615 --> 00:00:14,605
...and it started making sense to me.
I'm thinking:

6
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:17,554
"Yeah, cut through the shoe,
cut through the can, yeah.

7
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:18,860
Yeah, I want that."

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,474
So I called up the number
on the screen, you know...

9
00:00:21,627 --> 00:00:24,540
...and I said, " I'd like to order
the Ginsu knife."

10
00:00:24,696 --> 00:00:26,955
And the lady went, "Really?"

11
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,258
I mean, even the Ginsu people
have given up.

12
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:31,062
It's really so sad, you know.

13
00:00:31,217 --> 00:00:34,817
I guess, to be honest, if you need
a knife that can cut through a shoe...

14
00:00:34,977 --> 00:00:39,188
...perhaps you're not buying the
highest grade of meat available.

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:43,452
Maybe you ought to think about not
getting the "hoof cut" once in a while.

16
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:51,461
What is it about sleep
that mak es you so thirsty?

17
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,501
Do dreams require liquid?

18
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:56,800
It's not lik e I'm running a marathon,
I'm just lying there.

19
00:00:57,187 --> 00:00:58,867
What the hell?
Why is the door open?

20
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:05,815
- Kramer, what are you doing here?!
- Jerry, now calm down. It's okay.

21
00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:07,575
- Oh, God.
- I'm sorry.

22
00:01:07,736 --> 00:01:09,416
I didn't want to wake you up.

23
00:01:09,577 --> 00:01:11,453
I was watching
Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo...

24
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,556
...and l... You know, I wanted
to get some popcorn...

25
00:01:14,718 --> 00:01:16,593
...so I used the spare keys
that you gave me...

26
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:18,660
...to come in to get your popper.

27
00:01:18,822 --> 00:01:20,927
- You scared me!
- It's just me.

28
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:24,610
- That's enough!
- Yeah, okay. Forgot the popper.

29
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:31,784
It's not broken.

30
00:01:35,355 --> 00:01:37,963
Come on.

31
00:01:44,178 --> 00:01:45,629
Kramer!

32
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,011
What are you doing?

33
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,392
What does it look like? What?

34
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:50,580
Get out of the bathroom. I gotta go!

35
00:01:50,738 --> 00:01:52,538
All right, all right.

36
00:01:52,963 --> 00:01:55,329
- Come on!
- All right.

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,636
- Move it, move it! Get going!
- Well, my drain's all clogged up.

38
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:03,660
- Is that my towel?
- Yes.

39
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:08,688
I'm really happy the movie
was sold out.

40
00:02:08,844 --> 00:02:10,796
You ever pretend there's
murderers chasing you...

41
00:02:10,953 --> 00:02:13,288
...and see how fast you can
get into your apartment?

42
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:15,902
I'm from Wichita.

43
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,158
- There he is!
- Hurry, Jerry, he's coming.

44
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:22,338
- He's coming. The murderers!
- Hurry. Hurry, he's coming. Hurry!

45
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,332
Oh, Jerry.

46
00:02:25,914 --> 00:02:27,790
Boy, that was close.

47
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:30,314
Did you see the look
on that guy's face?

48
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,726
- You were so fast with those keys.
- Well...

49
00:02:40,644 --> 00:02:41,789
- Beautiful.
- Kramer!

50
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:43,290
What the hell are you doing here?

51
00:02:43,444 --> 00:02:46,390
Hey, Jerry, how are you? I thought
you were going to the movies.

52
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:47,696
That's it, hand them over.

53
00:02:47,856 --> 00:02:49,121
- What?
- You know what. The keys.

54
00:02:49,275 --> 00:02:50,617
You've lost your key privileges.

55
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:51,949
- Oh, come on.
- No "come on."

56
00:02:52,114 --> 00:02:54,252
- I thought you went to the movie.
- It was sold out.

57
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:56,063
How was I to know
it would be sold out?

58
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,669
- That's the point.
- What point?

59
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:00,011
- Just give me the keys.
- Just give me another chance.

60
00:03:00,169 --> 00:03:01,434
- Don't ask me.
- I'm asking you.

61
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:02,886
- I'm telling you.
- You're joking.

62
00:03:03,046 --> 00:03:04,540
- I'm serious.
- It won't happen again.

63
00:03:04,696 --> 00:03:06,267
- It will. Give me the keys.
- No.

64
00:03:06,422 --> 00:03:07,949
- Let go.
- You let go. Come on, Jerry.

65
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,673
Now, stop it. Come on, Kramer.

66
00:03:12,444 --> 00:03:13,863
Oh, great! Okay, all right.

67
00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:15,697
Fine, you go ahead. Take the keys.

68
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:17,429
But you're gonna regret this.

69
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:19,494
All right, yeah.

70
00:03:23,876 --> 00:03:25,141
Goochie.

71
00:03:26,676 --> 00:03:28,858
- So put them in a safe place.
- I will.

72
00:03:29,016 --> 00:03:30,664
- Where?
- I don't know.

73
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:32,041
I'll hide them.

74
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,032
- So is Kramer upset?
- I think so.

75
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:36,486
I mean, he's acting really weird lately.
He's different.

76
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,248
- Just give him the keys back.
- No, I can't.

77
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:42,898
Is that Kramer?

78
00:03:43,861 --> 00:03:46,195
- Who's there?
- Kramer.

79
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,685
Hey. Oh, hi. Oh, you got the...

80
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,592
- No, I am not...
- No, no, it's okay. It's okay.

81
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:58,120
I don't care about the keys.
It's my fault.

82
00:03:58,285 --> 00:04:00,576
No, I gave the keys away
with my stupidity.

83
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,031
I broke the covenant of the keys.

84
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,327
- Jerry, give him the keys back.
- Elaine.

85
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:08,942
- Here.
- What are you doing?

86
00:04:09,102 --> 00:04:10,935
- I'm giving him the keys.
- Those are my keys.

87
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:13,552
- Let go! Jerry! No!
- Elaine. Come on.

88
00:04:13,705 --> 00:04:16,269
Stop it! Stop it!
I don't want the keys back.

89
00:04:16,429 --> 00:04:18,381
No, I'm glad the way
things turned out.

90
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,295
I was clinging to those keys, man...

91
00:04:20,457 --> 00:04:23,140
...like a branch on the banks
of a raging river...

92
00:04:23,295 --> 00:04:24,670
...and now I have let go.

93
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:27,814
And I'm free to go with the current...

94
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:29,579
...to float.

95
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,037
- And I thank you.
- Take the keys.

96
00:04:31,198 --> 00:04:33,150
- I don't want them.
- I want you to have them.

97
00:04:33,307 --> 00:04:35,598
- I don't want them! I can't.
- Come on. Take them!

98
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:38,326
- No!
- Okay.

99
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:39,904
Now, one more thing.

100
00:04:40,059 --> 00:04:41,630
I would like my keys back.

101
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,311
- Your spare set?
- Yeah, that's right.

102
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,303
- You want them back?
- Yeah, yeah...

103
00:04:46,465 --> 00:04:47,916
...I think it would be for the best.

104
00:05:03,343 --> 00:05:04,717
Gee, Kramer, I...

105
00:05:04,878 --> 00:05:06,023
I don't know what to say.

106
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,593
Say yes.

107
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:11,854
Yes, George, yes.

108
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,381
- Yes?
- Yes.

109
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:18,909
Should I give you my keys?
Is that the transaction, trading keys?

110
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:21,362
- Because Elaine has my keys.
- You can get them back.

111
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:23,366
I suppose I could.

112
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:27,118
Because you see, George,
having the keys to Jerry's apartment...

113
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,531
...that kept me in a fantasy world.

114
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:33,832
Every time I went over to his house,
it was like I was on vacation.

115
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:36,710
Better food, better view, better TV.

116
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,626
Cleaner. Oh, much cleaner.

117
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:40,930
That became my reality.

118
00:05:41,396 --> 00:05:43,501
I ignored the squalor
in my own life...

119
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,572
...because I'm looking at life, you see,
through Jerry's eyes.

120
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:49,259
I was living in twilight, George.

121
00:05:49,414 --> 00:05:52,588
Living in the shadows,
living in the darkness...

122
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,125
...like you.

123
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,311
- Me?
- Oh, yeah.

124
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:00,222
I can barely see you, George.

125
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:04,256
All right, stop it, Kramer.
You're freaking me out.

126
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:06,713
Hi. Are you ready to order?

127
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,548
- Yeah. What's the...?
- No, not yet.

128
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:10,618
Excuse me.

129
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,682
Do you ever yearn?

130
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,207
Yearn? Do I yearn?

131
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,249
- I yearn.
- You yearn?

132
00:06:22,403 --> 00:06:24,051
Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn.

133
00:06:24,206 --> 00:06:28,155
Often I sit and yearn.

134
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:30,571
Have you yearned?

135
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:33,633
Well, not recently.

136
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,166
I craved.

137
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:38,783
I crave all the time.
Constant craving.

138
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:40,921
But I haven't yearned.

139
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:45,257
- Look at you.
- Oh, Kramer, don't start.

140
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,372
No, no. You're wasting your life.

141
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:50,289
I am not.
What you call wasting, I call living.

142
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:53,466
- I'm living my life.
- Okay, like what? No, tell me.

143
00:06:53,628 --> 00:06:55,428
- Do you have a job?
- No.

144
00:06:55,585 --> 00:06:57,417
- You got money?
- No.

145
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:59,335
Do you have a woman?

146
00:06:59,804 --> 00:07:01,178
No.

147
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:02,680
Do you have any prospects?

148
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:05,474
No.

149
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,849
You got anything on the horizon?

150
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:12,532
No.

151
00:07:13,153 --> 00:07:16,295
- You have any action at all?
- No.

152
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:19,703
Do you have any conceivable reason
for even getting up in the morning?

153
00:07:20,825 --> 00:07:23,466
I like to get the Daily News.

154
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:28,602
George, it's time for us
to grow up and be men...

155
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:30,751
...not little boys.
- Why?

156
00:07:30,914 --> 00:07:32,867
I'm going to California.
You know, I got the bug.

157
00:07:33,024 --> 00:07:35,086
Yeah, I think I got
a touch of something too.

158
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:37,966
No, the acting bug. Ever since
I was in that Woody Allen movie.

159
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,080
"These pretzels
are making me thirsty"?

160
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,142
That was one line. You got fired.

161
00:07:43,304 --> 00:07:46,600
I know, I know.
But, man, I never felt so alive.

162
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,669
- Now, you coming with me?
- No, I'm not.

163
00:07:49,826 --> 00:07:51,658
All right. Suit yourself.

164
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,347
But let's keep this between us.

165
00:07:53,508 --> 00:07:55,461
We're key brothers now.

166
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:57,916
You're not really gonna go
to California, are you?

167
00:07:58,073 --> 00:08:00,942
Up here, I'm already gone.

168
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:07,925
He gave me his spare keys...

169
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:10,452
...and now he wants my keys,
so I need mine back from you.

170
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:12,679
Because you have his keys?
Why does he need yours?

171
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:15,940
I don't know, he said
he wants to be my key brother.

172
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:18,742
- That's ridiculous.
- That's Kramer.

173
00:08:19,363 --> 00:08:22,352
I'll give you back your spare keys,
but now I want mine back.

174
00:08:22,777 --> 00:08:24,304
What for?

175
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:26,920
- Because I'll give them to Jerry.
- Jerry? Why?

176
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,332
- Because he gave me his.
- So what?

177
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:33,247
So if he has my keys,
I should have his.

178
00:08:33,403 --> 00:08:34,821
I don't see why if you have his...

179
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:37,234
...he should have yours.
- I just said the same thing.

180
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,803
- What?
- What?

181
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:41,991
I'll give you my keys,
but I don't have them here.

182
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:43,600
Can I have mine to give to Kramer?

183
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,478
Yeah, okay, I'll go get them.

184
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:51,507
What are you doing?
Would you just put that down?

185
00:08:51,662 --> 00:08:53,920
I gotta get some new friends.

186
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:56,954
- Did you bring the keys?
- Yes.

187
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:59,717
But I still don't feel right
about letting you into Kramer's.

188
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:01,136
This could be an emergency.

189
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,389
- You shouldn't have taken his keys.
- I tried to give them back.

190
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:06,923
- How'd the Mets do?
- They lost.

191
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,035
- Kramer!
- Come on, open it up.

192
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,755
- Kramer?
- Hello, boys.

193
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:18,473
- Hello, Newman.
- Are you looking for someone?

194
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:20,582
Don't play coy with me,
I'm not in the mood.

195
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:22,768
Coy? I'm not being coy.

196
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:24,190
- Is he being coy?
- Yeah, coy.

197
00:09:24,345 --> 00:09:26,908
You're being coy.
Now, where's Kramer, Newman?

198
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:29,751
- Who?
- Listen, Tiny...

199
00:09:30,482 --> 00:09:32,697
...I wanna know where Kramer is,
and I wanna know now!

200
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:35,195
- Hit me, Seinfeld, I got witnesses.
- Turn around, George.

201
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:36,456
- Sure.
- George?

202
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,834
Tell me where Kramer is
or we'll do this the hard way!

203
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:40,525
- Help! Help!
- Where's Kramer?

204
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:41,984
- Help!
- What's going on?

205
00:09:42,144 --> 00:09:44,631
- They're gonna beat me up.
- No, we're not.

206
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,438
We're trying to find Kramer.

207
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:48,960
You want to know what happened
to Kramer? I'll tell you.

208
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:50,805
He was ticked off about the keys.

209
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,530
Yeah, that's right, about the keys.

210
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:56,099
- Thought he got a bad rap.
- Bad rap?

211
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,525
- Yeah, from you.
- Me?

212
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,287
You heard me. So he packed a grip
and he split for the coast.

213
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:02,241
La-la land. L.A.

214
00:10:02,858 --> 00:10:04,352
L.A.?

215
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,106
I never should have taken
his keys away.

216
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:40,369
He drove me to it, I had no choice.

217
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:42,208
He wouldn't take them back.

218
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:43,972
Elaine, you saw it. Remember?

219
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,588
I said, "Take the keys back."
He wouldn't do anything.

220
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:48,313
You saw it. Didn't you see it?

221
00:10:48,468 --> 00:10:50,224
Yeah, yeah, I saw it.

222
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:52,568
I mean, it was complete bull...
But I saw.

223
00:10:55,603 --> 00:10:57,021
- What?
- No, what'd you say?

224
00:10:57,176 --> 00:10:59,783
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

225
00:11:02,239 --> 00:11:03,461
Oh, you didn't see it?

226
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,453
Yeah, I saw it. I saw it.

227
00:11:05,615 --> 00:11:08,484
- I saw it. Yep.
- I heard you say something there.

228
00:11:08,645 --> 00:11:12,278
- I didn't say anything.
- I'm calling Kramer's mother.

229
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:18,423
I don't know what you said,
but it was something.

230
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,723
I heard something.

231
00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:24,635
Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer?

232
00:11:25,025 --> 00:11:26,519
Mrs. Kramer?

233
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:29,205
Could you turn the music down?

234
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,967
Could you turn the music down?

235
00:11:32,237 --> 00:11:35,455
- Ask her about Kramer.
- She's drunk out of her mind.

236
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:55,362
Oh, my keys.

237
00:11:57,516 --> 00:11:59,698
This is perfect.

238
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,604
Elaine, are you there?

239
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:09,475
It's me. I'm locked out.
I need my spare keys. Where are you?

240
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:11,590
I'm at the coffee shop.

241
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,881
Hey! You ever been in an accident?

242
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,719
About five years ago.

243
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:22,872
I was going down this very road.

244
00:12:23,026 --> 00:12:27,510
Same time of day, going about
the same speed I'm going now.

245
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:29,467
There was a rock in the road.

246
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,423
It couldn't have been
more than a pebble.

247
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,532
Never really saw it.

248
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,901
Lost control of the bike,
went flying about a hundred feet.

249
00:12:38,063 --> 00:12:40,048
Came down right on my head.

250
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:41,814
Cracked it wide open.

251
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:45,805
Blood and stuff just splattered
all over the road there.

252
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:48,797
Broke every bone in my face.

253
00:12:49,647 --> 00:12:51,066
You know, when they found me...

254
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,166
...my eyes were hanging out
of their sockets.

255
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:57,203
Yeah, they pronounced me dead
at the scene.

256
00:12:57,358 --> 00:13:01,154
Was in a coma for...
Well, they told me about a year.

257
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:03,916
Said I'd be a vegetable for life.

258
00:13:04,071 --> 00:13:06,678
Yeah, but I showed them.

259
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:09,970
Of course, since then,
I always wear a helmet.

260
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,741
Lean.

261
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,305
Lean!

262
00:13:18,954 --> 00:13:20,481
Georgie boy.

263
00:13:20,642 --> 00:13:22,824
Way to come through with the keys.

264
00:13:22,982 --> 00:13:25,928
- Sit down, I'm buying you dinner.
- Look...

265
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:29,384
...I just don't feel right about
letting you into Elaine's apartment.

266
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:33,296
Don't feel right?
What are you talking about?

267
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:35,821
I let you into Kramer's.
Now you wanna go into Elaine's.

268
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:38,397
She entrusted me with her keys.
How can I just let you in?

269
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:39,931
What is the big deal?

270
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:41,923
Just because you have
someone's spare keys...

271
00:13:42,085 --> 00:13:43,612
...doesn't entitle you to break in.

272
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:45,529
That's the reason you took
Kramer's keys.

273
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:47,601
You're not even supposed
to have Elaine's keys.

274
00:13:47,763 --> 00:13:50,403
You're supposed to give them to her
so she can give them to me.

275
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,548
So technically, those are my keys.

276
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:54,544
If you'd never taken your keys
from Kramer...

277
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:56,233
...he never would have given
his to me.

278
00:13:56,394 --> 00:13:59,154
In which case, I wouldn't have
had to take mine back from her.

279
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:01,724
- I want those keys.
- No can do.

280
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,679
- George, I want these.
- Stop it, let go.

281
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:06,519
- George, I don't want to get physical.
- You wanna fight?

282
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:07,896
- Wanna fight?
- I'll fight you!

283
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,429
- Let's go.
- Nothing in the face!

284
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,193
- Okay.
- All right.

285
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:17,871
And then the evil ogre
took back the magical keys...

286
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:19,523
...from the handsome young prince.

287
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:24,237
Oh, no. He didn't
take back the keys.

288
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:26,000
- No way.
- Yes.

289
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:27,841
And then the handsome
young prince...

290
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:30,686
...was cast out
into the cruel, cruel world.

291
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:32,412
Oh, man, what a bummer.

292
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:34,706
- That ogre dude is pretty cold, huh?
- He's cold.

293
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:36,287
Let me tell you something, Kramer.

294
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,508
If that ogre dude pulled
that crap on me...

295
00:14:39,664 --> 00:14:40,842
...l'd stab him!
- Wait.

296
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,425
I'd cut him in half!

297
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:45,034
I'd gut him like a fish, man!

298
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:48,100
- That's what I'd do.
- Yeah, yeah. That'd be funny.

299
00:14:48,256 --> 00:14:49,751
Hey, you can drop me here.

300
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:51,203
Hey, what's the rush, man?

301
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:53,622
- Well, I got to be going now.
- Hey, Kramer...

302
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,536
...have you ever killed a man?

303
00:14:55,698 --> 00:14:56,843
What do you think?

304
00:14:57,003 --> 00:15:00,832
You think these hands have been
soaking in lvory Liquid, huh?

305
00:15:00,992 --> 00:15:03,447
Oh, don't leave, Kramer.
Stay with us.

306
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,705
Oh, you know so much
about the world. We need you.

307
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,198
- Please, Kramer.
- Please, Kramer.

308
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:09,808
Well, now, Star Cloud...

309
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:11,539
- Okay, wait a minute.
- Please, Kramer.

310
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:14,640
- No, no, no.
- Please, Kramer.

311
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:17,253
See? You're avoiding
the middleman.

312
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:19,821
You'd give her her keys,
which she would give to me.

313
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,773
So instead of giving them to her,
you give them to me.

314
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:25,923
Unfortunately, when she gave
you yours, you didn't give her hers.

315
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,912
She'd give them to me
because she has mine.

316
00:15:28,074 --> 00:15:29,830
Then I wouldn't have to ask you
for hers...

317
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:31,945
...so that I could get mine.

318
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:37,127
You're right. How did I miss that?

319
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:41,193
Maybe because it's a crock of sh...

320
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:45,023
- What's that?
- Nothing.

321
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:50,553
- I heard something.
- Didn't say anything.

322
00:15:54,849 --> 00:15:57,031
So how long you been driving
this thing?

323
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,989
Going on four years.

324
00:16:00,181 --> 00:16:03,509
Well, nothing's sexier than a woman
behind the wheel of a semi.

325
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,665
Nothing?

326
00:16:05,859 --> 00:16:07,385
Well...

327
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:14,028
Listen to you.
You're quite the sweet talker.

328
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,168
I always wanted to drive
the big rigs.

329
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:19,320
I used to watch those commercials
during reruns of Gomer Pyle.

330
00:16:19,477 --> 00:16:22,007
- You wanna give it a try?
- Really?

331
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:26,149
- Do you know how to double-clutch?
- Yeah.

332
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,792
- Well, come on.
- Wait a minute.

333
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:30,446
Wait.

334
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,425
Okay. All right.

335
00:16:49,436 --> 00:16:51,268
They were in here.
I saw her put them in here.

336
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,001
Well, this is great.

337
00:16:53,157 --> 00:16:54,957
- What do they look like?
- Like keys.

338
00:16:55,113 --> 00:16:57,022
They look like keys, George.

339
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,901
They look exactly like keys.

340
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:02,821
"What do they look like?"

341
00:17:03,284 --> 00:17:05,847
- They're obviously not here.
- They've got to be here.

342
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:10,677
Jerry, unless I pull down on this
statuette and a hidden wall opens up...

343
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:13,099
...we have checked every square inch
of this apartment.

344
00:17:14,715 --> 00:17:16,438
What is this?

345
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,774
- "Murphy Brown"?
- What?

346
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:23,069
- "By Elaine Benes"?
- What?

347
00:17:23,231 --> 00:17:25,369
Elaine's writing a Murphy Brown?

348
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:27,636
- Let me see this.
- Wait a second.

349
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,367
- Let me just look at it.
- Wait.

350
00:17:29,522 --> 00:17:32,588
- Give me half!
- All right, here!

351
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:35,728
Why didn't she tell us?

352
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:39,796
Elaine is writing a sitcom?

353
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,434
- You... You weasels!
- What?

354
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:48,811
- What?
- How dare you!

355
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,694
- We hardly read anything.
- It was funny.

356
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,344
Who gave you permission
to come in...

357
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,994
...and just go through my things?

358
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:56,832
- You thought it was funny?
- Well, you know...

359
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:59,743
...from what I saw...
- Well, it's just a first draft!

360
00:17:59,903 --> 00:18:02,008
I was locked out.
I'm just trying to get my keys.

361
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:04,803
- Why did you let him in?
- He forced me to.

362
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:06,068
- I did not!
- Yes, you did!

363
00:18:06,232 --> 00:18:09,636
- You, get out! Get out!
- Wait, I need my spare keys.

364
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,709
Oh, here's your damn keys.
You keep them.

365
00:18:11,871 --> 00:18:13,246
- I don't want them anymore.
- Good.

366
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:14,780
I want my keys back from you.

367
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,079
- I can't hold them?
- No, you can't be trusted.

368
00:18:17,242 --> 00:18:19,151
All right, all right. Fine!

369
00:18:19,313 --> 00:18:21,844
- And I don't want you to hold mine.
- Good, I won't!

370
00:18:21,998 --> 00:18:23,100
Good, don't.

371
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:25,174
- Are these my keys?
- These aren't my keys.

372
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:27,670
- Whose are these?
- I don't know.

373
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:29,509
No, those are yours...

374
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:41,329
I just thought I could write it.

375
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:43,361
Is that something you wanna do?

376
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:45,199
I don't know.

377
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,272
Those writers make a lot of money.

378
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,447
What?

379
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:53,717
Let me tell you something
about show business.

380
00:18:54,988 --> 00:18:57,170
- I can't believe it.
- It's hard work.

381
00:18:57,328 --> 00:18:59,237
You don't just write
a Murphy Brown.

382
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:01,854
You gotta watch the show,
get a sense of the characters...

383
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,579
...how they relate to each other.

384
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:06,342
Okay, can I just watch the show?

385
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,867
Oh, God, what an ass...

386
00:19:15,817 --> 00:19:17,573
What did you say?

387
00:19:19,078 --> 00:19:20,911
I didn't say anything.

388
00:19:22,147 --> 00:19:24,132
I heard something.

389
00:19:25,484 --> 00:19:26,903
Elaine, Elaine, it's Kramer!

390
00:19:27,057 --> 00:19:29,588
Kramer's on Murphy Brown!

391
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,615
- Kramer's on Murphy Brown!
- Look, there he is!

392
00:19:32,773 --> 00:19:34,878
He's sitting at the desk!

393
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:36,564
Hi, I'm Murphy Brown.

394
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:39,364
- You must be my new secretary.
- Good morning, Miss Brown.

395
00:19:39,524 --> 00:19:42,284
- And you are?
- I'm Steven Snell.

396
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:44,010
- Snell.
- Yes.

397
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:45,889
Well, hello, Mr. Snell.

398
00:19:46,045 --> 00:19:47,267
Steven.

399
00:19:47,426 --> 00:19:48,528
- Steven.
- Yes.

400
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:50,448
Are you familiar with this
computer system?

401
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,370
Oh, I'm familiar, yes.

402
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,209
Steven Snell, I know people...

403
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:58,655
...and I have a very good feeling
about you.

404
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:00,575
Yes.

405
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,621
So I fly a lot. I was on a plane
the other day and I was wondering...

406
00:20:12,782 --> 00:20:16,459
...are there keys to the plane?
Do they need keys to start the plane?

407
00:20:16,618 --> 00:20:19,989
Maybe that's what those delays on the
ground are sometimes, at the gate.

408
00:20:20,147 --> 00:20:22,132
Maybe the pilot's up in
the cockpit going:

409
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:24,051
"Oh, I don't believe this.

410
00:20:24,213 --> 00:20:26,123
Oh, my God...

411
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:28,194
...I did it again."

412
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,962
They tell you it's mechanical.

413
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:31,997
They don't want to come on
the PA system:

414
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:33,299
"Ladies and gentlemen...

415
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,869
...we're gonna be delayed here
a little while. I...

416
00:20:36,143 --> 00:20:38,554
Oh, God, this is so embarrassing.

417
00:20:38,713 --> 00:20:41,354
I left the keys to the plane
in my apartment."

418
00:20:41,514 --> 00:20:43,925
You see technicians,
you think they're servicing it...

419
00:20:44,084 --> 00:20:47,106
...but they're looking for the magnet
Hide-A-Key under the wing.

420
00:20:47,268 --> 00:20:49,755
"Maybe he left it up there
somewhere."

421
00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:35,516
