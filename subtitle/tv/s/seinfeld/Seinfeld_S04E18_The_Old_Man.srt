1
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,476
The life expectancy now is 72,
I think, for men.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,446
Seventy-five or six
or something for women.

3
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:11,141
It's amazing to think that
a couple thousand years ago...

4
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:13,150
...life expectancy was 30.

5
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:17,451
Which, in our terms, would mean you
get your driver's license around 5...

6
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:20,651
...you'd marry at 9, divorced at 15.

7
00:00:20,828 --> 00:00:23,729
In your late teens,
you move down to Florida.

8
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:27,061
I guess that's how spring break
got started. I don't know.

9
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,396
And eventually people
say things about you, like:

10
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,165
"Well, it's amazing, he's 28,
but he's still very alert.

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,707
His mind is so sharp, you would think
you're talking to a 2-year-old."

12
00:00:41,849 --> 00:00:44,079
What's the point?

13
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:50,355
When I like them, they don't like me.
When they like me, I don't like them.

14
00:00:51,292 --> 00:00:54,022
Why can't I act with ones I like
the way I do with ones I don't?

15
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:58,689
Well, you've only got another 50 years
or so to go and it'll all be over.

16
00:01:01,302 --> 00:01:04,635
Maybe I need someone
who doesn't speak English.

17
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:07,032
Yeah, how about a mute?

18
00:01:08,176 --> 00:01:10,041
A mute would be good.

19
00:01:10,745 --> 00:01:12,713
Where you gonna meet a mute?

20
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,111
This is what my life has come to:
Trying to meet a mute.

21
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:19,813
I don't know, Jerry,
Something's missing.

22
00:01:19,988 --> 00:01:23,685
There's a void, Jerry.
There's a void.

23
00:01:23,858 --> 00:01:26,725
A deep, yawning chasm.

24
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:30,191
Well, there's gotta be more to life
than this.

25
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:32,799
What gives you pleasure?

26
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,832
Listening to you.

27
00:01:35,003 --> 00:01:37,528
I listen to this for 15 minutes,
I'm on top of the world.

28
00:01:37,705 --> 00:01:40,071
Your misery is my pleasure.

29
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,500
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, how you doing?

30
00:01:42,677 --> 00:01:46,511
Good. Okay. Well, it's all set.
I start tomorrow.

31
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:49,241
- Start what?
- I signed up to do volunteer work...

32
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:51,510
...with senior citizens.
- Really?

33
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:54,382
Yeah. God. I can't tell you how I feel.

34
00:01:54,555 --> 00:01:58,252
I mean, I feel so good.
I really feel good.

35
00:01:58,426 --> 00:02:01,224
The strange thing is, I mean,
I haven't even met the woman yet.

36
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:03,921
- Volunteer work?
- What are you gonna do down there?

37
00:02:04,098 --> 00:02:06,692
They say all it is is you go
over to their apartment and...

38
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:09,666
...you take them out for a walk
and you get a cup of coffee...

39
00:02:09,837 --> 00:02:12,067
...and it's supposed
to make them feel good.

40
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,435
That's what I do with him.

41
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:18,408
Wait. When did you get this idea?

42
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,342
Last time I had lunch with you here.

43
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,507
You were going on and on and on
about how you wanna...

44
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,880
...meet somebody
who didn't speak English.

45
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,552
What, do you break it in with her
then you try it out on me?

46
00:02:31,726 --> 00:02:34,559
- And anybody could do this?
- Yeah.

47
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,287
Really?

48
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:38,398
Helping people.

49
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:40,797
Of course.

50
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:42,458
Of course.

51
00:02:42,637 --> 00:02:44,901
It makes perfect sense.

52
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:47,337
How could I not be doing this?

53
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:50,807
- I am gonna help somebody, damn it.
- What about you?

54
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:52,240
No, it's not for me.

55
00:02:52,413 --> 00:02:54,711
Jerry, if anybody should
be doing this, it's you.

56
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:57,715
What kind of a person are you?

57
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,043
I think I'm pretty much like you.

58
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,712
Only successful.

59
00:03:08,763 --> 00:03:10,924
This is a wonderful thing.
They're so grateful...

60
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,566
...to have someone to talk to.

61
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,032
And I can tell you
that everyone who participates...

62
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:17,171
...finds the experience
extremely rewarding.

63
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:19,101
Well, I feel better already.

64
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:21,571
I mean, I'm feeling like
a good person.

65
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,037
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

66
00:03:24,545 --> 00:03:26,308
Thank you.

67
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:28,779
Hey, hey, what's your guy's
name again?

68
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,009
Fields. Sidney Fields.

69
00:03:31,185 --> 00:03:34,484
Eighty-seven years old.
Eighty-seven.

70
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:39,422
- How about your guy?
- Ben Cantwell, 85.

71
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,255
You think we'll make it to that age?

72
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,090
We? No.

73
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,463
- Hey.
- Hey.

74
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:53,135
So, what's up, diggety-dog?

75
00:03:53,307 --> 00:03:56,401
George and I just signed up with
the senior citizens volunteer agency.

76
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:57,874
Same thing Elaine's doing.

77
00:03:58,045 --> 00:03:59,444
Oh, that's too bad.

78
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:01,872
Don't say I didn't try to warn you.

79
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,008
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, Jerry, I'm surprised at you.

80
00:04:06,187 --> 00:04:08,052
- What?
- It's a con.

81
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:12,352
These agencies are usually a front
for some money-laundering scheme.

82
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:13,926
Or they're bunco artists.

83
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:17,792
Bilking people out of their life savings.
Oh, yeah.

84
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:21,868
- Where do you get this?
- The alternative media, Jerry.

85
00:04:22,036 --> 00:04:24,129
That's where you hear the truth.

86
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,671
Kramer? Kramer?

87
00:04:26,841 --> 00:04:31,244
Kramer! Where are you? Kramer!

88
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:33,972
Come on, I'm in here. Come on.

89
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,044
- There you are.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:36,217 --> 00:04:38,811
Hello, Newman.

91
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,586
Jerry. George. So did you ask him
about the records?

92
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:45,020
- Well...
- What records?

93
00:04:45,193 --> 00:04:50,563
Newman and I are going partners,
selling used records.

94
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:59,134
You know Ron's Records
down on Bleecker?

95
00:04:59,307 --> 00:05:00,865
They pay big cash for used records.

96
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:02,976
So we thought if you had any
of those big...

97
00:05:03,144 --> 00:05:05,908
...old-fashioned useless records
just lying around, you know...

98
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,775
We'd take them off your hands. Free.

99
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:10,918
Let me ask you something.
What do you do for a living, Newman?

100
00:05:11,085 --> 00:05:13,645
I'm a United States postal worker.

101
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:16,746
Aren't those the guys
that always go crazy...

102
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:19,119
...and come back with a gun
and shoot everybody?

103
00:05:19,827 --> 00:05:22,022
Sometimes.

104
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,096
- Why is that?
- Because the mail never stops.

105
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:29,395
It just keeps coming and coming
and coming.

106
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,037
Never a letup. It's relentless.

107
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,003
Every day it piles up more and more
and you gotta get it out...

108
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:35,665
...but more keeps coming in!

109
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:38,971
Then the bar code reader breaks,
and it's Publishers Clearing House day!

110
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:40,773
All right, all right, all right.

111
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:43,473
Just take the records.
They're in the bedroom. Take them.

112
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:46,211
- Take anything you want.
- Yeah, yeah.

113
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:52,525
I'll give you 5 bucks.

114
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:54,526
- Five bucks?
- Five bucks?

115
00:05:54,695 --> 00:05:58,597
- Do you know what those are worth?
- Yeah, I do. Five dollars.

116
00:05:58,766 --> 00:06:00,893
Those records are worth more
than 5 dollars.

117
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:03,002
- He's gypping us.
- You're gypping us.

118
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,401
Well, what do you got? You know,
you got Don Ho Live In Honolulu.

119
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,634
You got Jerry Vale
Sings Italian Love Songs.

120
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,005
And you got Sergio Mendes.
Now, come on!

121
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:14,511
Wait, wait, wait. Sergio Mendes
has a cult following.

122
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:16,149
Why, they follow him like a cult.

123
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:18,285
Can't walk down the street
in South America.

124
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:22,388
Look, that's his problem, all right?
Now, you don't like it? Too bad.

125
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:24,922
- I don't like it.
- I don't like it.

126
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:26,719
Then get out of my store, all right?

127
00:06:26,894 --> 00:06:29,954
You bring me something decent,
I'll give you some money.

128
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:32,326
- All right, we'll be back, Jack.
- All right.

129
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,365
- Come on.
- We'll be back...

130
00:06:34,535 --> 00:06:35,797
...Jack.

131
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:45,342
Hi. I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
The agency sent me.

132
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:49,040
- Agency?
- Yeah. Is this Sid Fields' residence?

133
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:52,617
- Sid Fields?
- What the hell is it?

134
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,220
- Mr. Fields?
- What?

135
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:56,754
Hi. I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
The agency sent me.

136
00:06:56,924 --> 00:07:01,258
The agency? What agency?
The CIA?

137
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:04,055
- No, no, the senior...
- Who let you in here?

138
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:06,392
- The woman.
- Oh, her.

139
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:11,766
She steals from me. Steals my money.
She says she doesn't speak English.

140
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:14,499
My ass, she doesn't speak English.

141
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:18,372
Plays that freaking voodoo music.

142
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:21,481
Tries to hypnotize me.

143
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,913
She thinks she's gonna turn me
into a zombie...

144
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:25,712
...and then rob me blind.

145
00:07:26,587 --> 00:07:28,521
Well, I wasn't born yesterday.

146
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:32,682
I might drop dead today, but I
sure as hell wasn't born yesterday.

147
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,885
Now, get the hell out of my house.

148
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:38,523
But, Mr. Fields, I'm here
to spend some time with you.

149
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,690
Oh, really?

150
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:44,360
Are you the boyfriend?
I know she's got a boyfriend.

151
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:48,167
Are you gonna kill me?
I'm an old man, for crying out loud.

152
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,435
You gonna kill an old man,
you coward?

153
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:53,011
No, Mr. Fields. Look. Really. I'm...
Here's my ident...

154
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,240
I can't read that, you fool.

155
00:07:56,417 --> 00:07:59,477
- Well, what's all this stuff?
- Trash. Garbage.

156
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,848
You're throwing this out?

157
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:06,016
I believe that's what you do
with garbage, you idiot.

158
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:09,687
Really? You don't want any of this?

159
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:15,734
Well, if I wanted it, I wouldn't be
throwing it away, would I, Einstein?

160
00:08:15,903 --> 00:08:18,371
I have friends that would really love
to have these.

161
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,873
Well, take it. I sure as hell am not
gonna give it to my family.

162
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,945
Well, do you wanna go out and go
for a walk, get a cup of coffee?

163
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:27,239
With you?

164
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:29,474
I'd rather be dead.

165
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,375
Well, maybe I'll get going, then.

166
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:36,280
I just remembered I got
an appointment to get my tonsils out.

167
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:39,585
Good. Thank God. Good riddance.

168
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:42,555
Oh, listen, before you go...

169
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,255
...would you mind
changing my diaper?

170
00:08:51,806 --> 00:08:54,570
Oh, I feel great for 85.

171
00:08:54,742 --> 00:09:00,203
You know, the average life span
for an American male is, like, 72.

172
00:09:01,215 --> 00:09:02,773
You're really...

173
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,612
...kind of pushing
the envelope there.

174
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,618
I'm not afraid to die,
and I never think about it.

175
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:12,324
You don't?

176
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:14,825
Boy, I think about it a lot.

177
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:16,462
I think about it at my age.

178
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,497
Imagine how much
I'll be thinking about it at your age.

179
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:22,636
All I'll do is keep thinking about it
till it drives me insane.

180
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:25,271
I'm grateful for
every moment I have.

181
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,373
Grateful?

182
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:31,568
How can you be grateful
when you're so close to the end?

183
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:33,940
When you know that any second:

184
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:37,043
It could all be over.
I mean, you're not stupid.

185
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:39,448
You can read the handwriting
on the wall.

186
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,384
It's a matter of simple arithmetic,
for God's sake.

187
00:09:43,357 --> 00:09:45,222
I guess I just don't care.

188
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:47,656
What are you talking about?

189
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:49,887
How can you sit there
and look me in the eye...

190
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:53,295
...and tell me that you're not worried?
Don't you have any sense?

191
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,729
Don't you have a brain?

192
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:57,166
Are you so completely senile
you don't even know...

193
00:09:57,338 --> 00:09:59,169
...what you're talking about
anymore?

194
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,467
Wait a second.
Where are you going?

195
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,372
Life's too short to waste on you.

196
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:08,447
- Whoa, whoa, please.
- Get out of my way.

197
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:13,414
But, Mr. Cantwell,
you owe me for the soup.

198
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,164
- Mrs. Oliver?
- Yes, my dear?

199
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:37,638
- What's the trouble? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:40,473
Yeah... Yes. Yeah.

201
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:44,409
It's my goiter, isn't it?

202
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:49,518
Did you say goiter? What goiter?

203
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:55,226
This football-shaped lump
jutting out the side of my neck.

204
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,968
That goiter.

205
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,695
Hey.

206
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:11,139
What do you know?

207
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:14,380
Does it bother you?

208
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:17,039
Bother me?

209
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,812
Why would a little goiter like that
bother me?

210
00:11:19,987 --> 00:11:24,048
No. Not a bit. It's nothing.
It's nothing. It's...

211
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:27,820
In fact, it's very distinctive.
You know?

212
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:30,623
I mean, you wanna
know something?

213
00:11:30,798 --> 00:11:33,323
I wish I had one.

214
00:11:35,536 --> 00:11:37,026
Really.

215
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:42,466
Come on, Elaine, it's just a goiter.

216
00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:46,511
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I can't look the woman in the face.

217
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:51,248
I mean, I keep thinking that goiter's
gonna start talking to me.

218
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:56,581
You'd think that they'd mention that
before they sent you over there.

219
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,853
"Oh, by the way, this woman
almost has a second head."

220
00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:05,696
But no, no.
I didn't get any goiter information.

221
00:12:05,866 --> 00:12:10,530
They really should mention that in the
breakdown. Height. Weight. Goiter.

222
00:12:10,704 --> 00:12:12,433
You know, you try to do some good.

223
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,803
You wanna be a good person,
but this is too much to ask.

224
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:18,638
Well, I'd rather talk to a goiter
with a nice disposition...

225
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:21,212
...than the nut they sent me to.

226
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,679
Georgie, what happened
with your guy?

227
00:12:25,252 --> 00:12:27,777
I don't think it's gonna work out.

228
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,519
- What do you mean?
- He fired me.

229
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,592
He fired you?

230
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:36,855
How do you get fired
from a volunteer job?

231
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:42,467
I don't know. I was just talking
to the man, and he walked out on me.

232
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,900
Well, I don't know about you two,
but I'm quitting.

233
00:12:45,072 --> 00:12:46,937
I hate my guy.

234
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:49,667
He's a mean, mean guy.

235
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,476
- I wish I could quit.
- So quit.

236
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,807
Yeah, I'm a great quitter.

237
00:12:55,516 --> 00:12:57,507
It's one of the few things I do well.

238
00:12:57,685 --> 00:13:00,119
I come from a long line of quitters.

239
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:03,347
My father was a quitter.
My grandfather was a quitter.

240
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:06,015
I was raised to give up.

241
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:09,418
- Hey.
- Hey.

242
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:11,655
Well, here's your albums.

243
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:13,595
- What happened?
- Five dollars.

244
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:17,066
- He offered us 5 dollars.
- What kind of stuff you listening to?

245
00:13:17,237 --> 00:13:19,262
You embarrassed me at that store.

246
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,000
That guy thought we were
a couple of total squares.

247
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,201
Oh, yeah,
you and your Sergio Mendes.

248
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:27,711
Hey, that guy can't even go
to the bathroom in South America.

249
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:29,405
You should have seen the albums...

250
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:32,017
...this old guy I was visiting today
was throwing away.

251
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,553
Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson,
Benny Goodman.

252
00:13:35,723 --> 00:13:38,817
- Wait, he's throwing them out?
- I asked if my friends could have them.

253
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:40,584
- He said, "Yeah."
- The coot's sitting...

254
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:42,524
...on a mountain of gold.
- Yeah.

255
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,596
You have to get them.
I'm not carrying them.

256
00:13:44,765 --> 00:13:47,199
- But you're gonna come.
- Yeah. I'm going there today.

257
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,393
In fact, you should see
this housekeeper.

258
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,231
She's from Senegal.

259
00:13:51,405 --> 00:13:54,135
Wild, wild stuff.

260
00:13:54,308 --> 00:13:55,639
Senegal?

261
00:13:58,312 --> 00:14:01,713
So you don't speak
any English at all?

262
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,880
- English? No.
- No.

263
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,044
Hey, what are those bums
doing back there?

264
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,281
You said they could come
and take the records.

265
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:14,757
It's like watching a couple of hyenas
going through the garbage.

266
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:18,830
- You don't speak any English?
- No English.

267
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:25,829
I would like to dip my bald head in oil
and rub it all over your body.

268
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,672
You don't understand.

269
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:32,802
It's a miracle.

270
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,939
You don't understand
because you don't speak English.

271
00:14:37,117 --> 00:14:39,051
So I just don't know
if this arrangement...

272
00:14:39,219 --> 00:14:42,086
Hey. Hey. I don't like
what's going on around here.

273
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,451
- I want all of you bums out of here.
- Calm down...

274
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,286
- Don't tell me to calm down.
- Please...

275
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,360
- Get your hands off me.
- Cool it, pops.

276
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:50,759
- Why, you little...
- Wait, wait, Mr. Fields.

277
00:14:52,366 --> 00:14:54,027
He's biting me!

278
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:57,327
My teeth. My teeth!

279
00:14:57,504 --> 00:14:59,301
Where's his teeth?
Where's his teeth?

280
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:00,906
I saw something fly over here.

281
00:15:01,074 --> 00:15:03,133
Well, turn the light on.

282
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:06,108
That's the garbage disposal.

283
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:12,176
My teeth. You idiots.

284
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:15,116
Well, we'll take you to your dentist.
Where's your dentist?

285
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,517
- Downtown.
- All right.

286
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:19,591
George, Kramer, look after Mr. Fields.
I'll go get the cab.

287
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,990
Bunch of morons.

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,662
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where's the old man?

289
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,035
I thought George
was keeping an eye on him.

290
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:34,640
- Me? I thought you were.
- Come on, we lost the old man.

291
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,902
Let's go. Get out of the car.
Go. We've gotta find him.

292
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:40,046
He can't have gotten far.

293
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:51,621
And we would take
long automobile trips.

294
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:54,625
- Well, that sounds like a lot of fun.
- Yes, and...

295
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:57,855
...just staring out the window...

296
00:15:58,031 --> 00:16:04,231
...you'd see a long view
of rolling pastures and...

297
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:09,706
- Get you going, right there.
...and very big Brahman cows and...

298
00:16:09,877 --> 00:16:13,142
- Oh, cows? Oh, that's...
- Yeah, that was when...

299
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:17,340
...fascinating.
...I began my affair with Mohandas.

300
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:23,113
- What?
- Mohandas.

301
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,516
Gandhi?

302
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:30,595
The passion.

303
00:16:34,668 --> 00:16:38,195
The forbidden pleasure.

304
00:16:39,573 --> 00:16:43,270
You had an affair with Gandhi?

305
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:49,046
He used to dip his bald head in oil...

306
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:55,350
...and he'd rub it all over my body.

307
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,417
Here. Look.

308
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:02,189
Oh, my God.

309
00:17:02,996 --> 00:17:05,430
The Mahatma?

310
00:17:06,366 --> 00:17:08,425
We're supposed to be looking
for the old man.

311
00:17:08,602 --> 00:17:09,591
Oh, we will. We will.

312
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:12,229
Twenty bucks.

313
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,601
Twenty bucks?
Are you out of your mind?

314
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:19,007
- Take it or leave it.
- We got Al Jolson here. Al Jolson!

315
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:21,545
Al Jolson. What the hell do I care
about Al Jolson?

316
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:24,275
I'd just as soon hear
you sing "Mammy."

317
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:27,416
This guy is nothing
but a piece of crap.

318
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,115
You are nothing but a piece of crap.

319
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:32,451
What did you call me?

320
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:34,958
- A piece of crap.
- A piece of crap.

321
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:39,428
- I find you extremely ugly.
- I find you extremely ugly.

322
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,366
- Do you?
- You emit a foul and unpleasant odor.

323
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:48,600
- You emit a foul and unpleasant odor.
- Oh, is that right?

324
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:52,438
- I loathe you.
- I loathe you.

325
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,205
That's it. Get out of my store.

326
00:17:54,381 --> 00:17:56,315
- Make us.
- Make us. Make us. Make us.

327
00:17:56,483 --> 00:18:00,214
- I'll make you.
- Wait a minute. Wait! Wait!

328
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:03,755
Do you realize how irresponsible
this is?

329
00:18:03,924 --> 00:18:06,722
Our agency's sole purpose
is to care for senior citizens.

330
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:09,020
And in one fell swoop
you have single-handedly...

331
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:11,130
...destroyed our reputation.

332
00:18:11,765 --> 00:18:13,756
Yes, but...

333
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:18,604
- Yes?
- It's Tim Fields. Mr. Fields' son.

334
00:18:18,772 --> 00:18:20,899
All right, come on up.

335
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,769
Oh, great.

336
00:18:22,943 --> 00:18:25,878
I don't know what happened.
We tried to take him to the dentist.

337
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:28,014
Why were you taking him
to the dentist?

338
00:18:29,116 --> 00:18:31,846
Well, his false teeth got mangled up
in the garbage disposal.

339
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:34,351
What were his teeth doing
in the garbage disposal?

340
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:36,853
- Well, after he bit my friend...
- Bit your friend?

341
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:42,250
What the hell is going on here?
How do you lose a human being?

342
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:44,659
- I am sorry.
- And who were these other people?

343
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:46,526
What were they doing
in the apartment?

344
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,999
Well, I brought them up there
to take his records.

345
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,694
Take his records?

346
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:54,864
Do you realize how valuable
that record collection is?

347
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:56,805
- Hey!
- There you are. Did you find him?

348
00:18:56,977 --> 00:18:58,205
No.

349
00:18:58,378 --> 00:19:01,347
We took the records over to Ron's,
and he tried to screw us...

350
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,506
...and then we got in a fight.
- A real melee.

351
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,652
Yeah, a real brouhaha.

352
00:19:07,087 --> 00:19:11,547
- Then all the records broke.
- The records? My father's records?

353
00:19:11,725 --> 00:19:15,092
- Did anybody try and call him?
- Yeah, I called, but there's no answer.

354
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:16,524
Well, the line's busy now.

355
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,359
The line's busy. He must be home.

356
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,346
We...

357
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:43,785
We couldn't find him.

358
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:49,991
What the hell's the point?

359
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:52,063
When you like them,
they don't like you...

360
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,065
...and when they like you,
you don't like them.

361
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,302
Oh, you don't know what you want.

362
00:19:57,471 --> 00:19:59,166
You should see a psychiatrist.

363
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:01,864
I got fixed up last week.

364
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,101
I never would get fixed up.

365
00:20:04,277 --> 00:20:07,110
I go to pick her up,
and she opens the door...

366
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,547
...and she's got this huge goiter
growing out of the side of her neck.

367
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:15,244
Looked like a football.

368
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:18,849
- What did you do?
- Well, we get to talking...

369
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:22,688
...and as it turns out,
the woman knew Gandhi.

370
00:20:23,997 --> 00:20:25,965
We talked for hours.

371
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,328
Well, are you gonna see her again?

372
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:31,164
We were getting along real good...

373
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:33,499
...and then she made some tea.

374
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:36,267
Put some milk in it
without asking me.

375
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,536
Now, that's a turnoff.

376
00:20:39,713 --> 00:20:40,941
You don't need that.

377
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,411
The thing about old people...

378
00:20:42,582 --> 00:20:44,447
...is everything about them
gets smaller.

379
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:48,213
You know, their bodies get smaller.
They move into smaller places.

380
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:50,822
They sleep less time,
they eat smaller meals.

381
00:20:50,991 --> 00:20:53,983
Except the car. The older they get,
the bigger their car gets.

382
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:55,856
I've never understood that.

383
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:58,361
Old people have a way
of backing out of the driveway.

384
00:20:58,532 --> 00:21:00,591
Know what I mean?
They don't turn side to side.

385
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:03,235
They just go, "I'm old.
I've been waiting a long time.

386
00:21:03,403 --> 00:21:06,600
I'm backing it out." You know?
"I'm coming back.

387
00:21:06,773 --> 00:21:09,901
Watch out. I'm coming," you know.
And you've gotta watch out for them.

388
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:13,170
And then once they get out there
they drive so slowly.

389
00:21:13,346 --> 00:21:15,405
I would think the less time
you have in life...

390
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:17,550
...the faster you would wanna go.

391
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:20,242
I think old people should be allowed
to drive their age.

392
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,388
If you're 80, do 80.

393
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:24,319
If you're 100, go 100.

394
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:28,587
They can't see where they're going
anyway, let them have fun out there.
