1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:04,000
Do you know what this is all about?
Know why we're here?

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,400
To be out. This is out.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Out is one of the single most
enjoyable experiences of life.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,600
Know how people talk about
"We should go out"?

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,600
This is what they're talking about.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,400
This whole thing. We're all out now.

7
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,800
No one is home.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,400
Not one person here is home.
We're all out.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,600
There are people trying to find us.
They don't know where we are.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
"Did you re...? I can't find him.
Where did he go?

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,400
He didn't tell me where he was going.
He must have gone out."

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,100
You wanna go out. You get ready,
you pick out the clothes, right?

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,000
You take the shower, get all ready...

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,600
...get the cash, get your friends,
the car, the spot, the reservation.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,400
Then you stand around.
What do you do?

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,500
You go, "We gotta be getting back."

17
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,700
Once you're out,
you wanna get back.

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,800
You wanna go to sleep, you wanna
get up, wanna go out again tomorrow.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,200
Wherever you are in life...

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,200
...it's my feeling, you've gotta go.

21
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,500
See, to me, that button's
in the worst possible spot.

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,600
The second button literally
makes or breaks the shirt.

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,400
Look at it. It's too high.

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,300
It's in no man's land. You look like
you live with your mother.

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,800
Are you through?

26
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,700
You do, of course,
try on when you buy.

27
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,600
Yes, it was purple. I liked it.

28
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,800
I don't actually recall
considering the buttons.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,600
Oh, you don't recall.

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,500
No, not at this time.

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,200
Senator, I'd like to know what
you knew and when you knew it.

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,800
Mr. Seinfeld, Mr. Costanza.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,200
Are you sure this is decaf?

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,800
Where's the orange indicator?

35
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,600
It's missing.
I have to do it in my head.

36
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Decaf left, regular right.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,400
Decaf left, regular right.

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,300
It's very challenging work.

39
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,600
Can you relax? It's a cup of coffee.

40
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,000
- Claire's a professional waitress.
- Trust me, George.

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,500
No one has any interest
in seeing you on caffeine.

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,300
How come you're not doing
the second show tomorrow?

43
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,800
Well, there's this woman
who might be coming in.

44
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,100
Wait a second. Wait a second.

45
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,900
What coming in?
What woman's coming in?

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,400
I told you about Laura,
the girl I met in Michigan.

47
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,600
- You didn't.
- I thought I told you about her.

48
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,400
Yeah. She teaches political science...

49
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,100
...I met her the night I did
the show in Lansing.

50
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,500
- There's no milk in here.
- Wait.

51
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,600
What is she...
What is she like?

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,600
Oh, she's really great.
She's got a real warmth about her.

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,400
And she's really bright
and really pretty.

54
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,200
And the conversation,
though, I mean, it was...

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,300
Talking with her was like
talking with you...

56
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
...but, you know,
obviously much better.

57
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,200
So, you know, what happened?

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,500
Well, nothing happened.
But it was great.

59
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Nothing happened, but it was...
This is great.

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,000
- Yeah.
- So, you know...

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,100
...she called and said
she wants to go out?

62
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,800
God bless. You devil, you.

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,600
Yeah. Well, not exactly.

64
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,500
I mean, she said...
She called this morning and said...

65
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,200
...she had to come in for a seminar,
maybe we'd get together.

66
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
"Had to"?

67
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,400
- "Had to come in"?
- Yeah, but...

68
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,900
- "Had to come in"?
- Yeah, but...

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,300
"And maybe we'll get together"?

70
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,900
"Had to" and "maybe"?

71
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,100
- Yeah.
- No, no.

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,400
I hate to tell you this.
You're not gonna see her.

73
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,700
What? Are you serious?
Why did she call?

74
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,000
What do I know?
Maybe she wanted to be polite.

75
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,900
To be polite?

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
- You are insane.
- All right.

77
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,400
I didn't want to tell you.
Wanna know why she called?

78
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,200
You're a backup.

79
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,300
You're a second line,
a "just in case"...

80
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,600
...a B plan, a contingency.

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,700
Oh, I get it. This is about the button.

82
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,100
Claire. Claire, you're a woman, right?

83
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,400
What gave it away, George?

84
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,000
I'd like to ask you...

85
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,000
Ask you to analyze a hypothetical
phone call, you know...

86
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,100
...from a female point of view.
- Oh, come on.

87
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,700
What are you asking her?
Now, how's she gonna know?

88
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,500
Now, a woman calls me, right?

89
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,100
She says she has to...

90
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,000
...come to New York on business...
- You're beautiful.

91
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,600
And maybe...

92
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,300
...she'll see me when she gets in.

93
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,500
Does this woman intend
to spend time with me?

94
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,900
I'd have to say no.

95
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,000
So why did she call?

96
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,000
- Be polite.
- To be polite.

97
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,400
- I rest my case.
- Good, good. Did you have fun?

98
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,000
You have no idea what you're
talking about. Come with me.

99
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,000
I gotta go get my stuff
out of the dryer.

100
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,500
- I'm not gonna watch you do laundry.
- Oh, come on. Be a "come-with" guy.

101
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,900
Come on. I'm tired.

102
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,500
Don't worry.
I gave him a little caffeine.

103
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,800
- He'll perk up.
- Right. I knew I felt something.

104
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,700
Jerry, I have to tell you something.

105
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,200
This is the dullest moment
I've ever experienced.

106
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,400
Oh, look at this guy.

107
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,400
Look, he's got everything.
He's got detergents, sprays...

108
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,000
...fabric softener.
This is not his first load.

109
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,700
I need a break, Jerry.
I gotta get out of the city.

110
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,100
- I feel so cramped...
- You didn't hear how she sounded.

111
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,000
- What?
- Laura.

112
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,500
I can't believe...
We already discussed this.

113
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,200
Yeah, but how could you
be so sure?

114
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,200
Because it's signals, Jerry.
It's signals. Don't you...?

115
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,700
All right. Did she even ask you what
you were doing tomorrow night...

116
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,200
...if you were busy?
- No.

117
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,200
She calls you today,
she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow?

118
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,200
- What is that? It's Saturday night.
- Yeah.

119
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,700
What is that? It's ridiculous.

120
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,900
You don't even know
what hotel she's staying at.

121
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,400
You can't call her.
That's a signal, Jerry.

122
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,800
That's a signal. Signal.

123
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,300
- Maybe you're right.
- Maybe I'm right?

124
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,200
Of course I'm right.

125
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,500
This is insane.

126
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,800
You know, I don't even know
where she's staying.

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,200
She's not gonna call me.

128
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,400
- This is unbelievable.
- I know, I know. It's tough.

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Listen, your stuff
has to be done by now.

130
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,700
Why don't you just see if it's dry.

131
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,700
No, no, no.
Don't interrupt the cycle.

132
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,100
The machine is working. It knows
what it's doing. Just let it finish.

133
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,100
- You're gonna overdry it.
- You can't overdry.

134
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,600
- Why not?
- Same reason you can't overwet.

135
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,800
You see, once something
is wet, it's wet.

136
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,000
Same thing with death.

137
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,300
Like, once you die,
you're dead. Right?

138
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,700
Let's say you drop dead
and I shoot you.

139
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,200
You're not gonna die again.
You're already dead.

140
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,000
You can't "overdie," you can't overdry.

141
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,400
Any questions?

142
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,200
How could she not tell me
where she was staying?

143
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,100
Look at that. They're done.
Look at that.

144
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,800
Laundry day is the only
exciting day...

145
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,300
...in the life of clothes.

146
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,800
It is. No, think about it.
The washing machine...

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,500
...is the nightclub of clothes.

148
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,800
You know, it's dark,
there's bubbles happening...

149
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,100
...they're all kind of
dancing around in there.

150
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,200
A shirt grabs the underwear.
"Come on, babe. Let's go."

151
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,600
You come by, open up the lid
and they all...

152
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,600
Socks are the most
amazing article of clothing.

153
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,900
They hate their lives.
They're with stinky feet...

154
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,700
...the boring drawers.

155
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,100
The dryer is their only chance
to escape and they all know it.

156
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,600
They do escape from the dryer.
They plan it in the hamper...

157
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,600
...the night before.
"Tomorrow, the dryer, I'm going.

158
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,200
You wait here."

159
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,400
The dryer door swings open, the sock
is waiting up against the side wall.

160
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,000
He hopes you don't see him,
then he goes down the road.

161
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,200
They get buttons sewn on their face,
join a puppet show.

162
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,500
So they're showing me
on television...

163
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,200
...the detergents
getting out bloodstains.

164
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,000
Is this a violent image to anybody?
Bloodstains?

165
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,800
Come on. You got a T-shirt
with bloodstains all over it...

166
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,000
...maybe laundry isn't your
biggest problem right now.

167
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,200
Maybe you ought to get the harpoon
out of your chest first.

168
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,300
If you know what happened in the Met
game, don't tell me. I taped it. Hello.

169
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,800
Yeah. No, I'm sorry.
You have the wrong number.

170
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,200
Yeah. No...

171
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,300
- Yeah.
- You up?

172
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,700
Yeah.

173
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,700
People do move.

174
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,900
Have you ever seen the big trucks
out on the street?

175
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,500
Yeah, no problem.

176
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,000
- Boy, the Mets blew it tonight, huh?
- Oh, what are you doing?

177
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,000
Kessler, it's a tape.
I taped the game.

178
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,400
It's 1:00 in the morning.

179
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,900
I avoided human contact
all night to watch this.

180
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,200
Hey, I'm sorry.
You know, I thought you knew.

181
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,000
You got any meat?

182
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,600
Meat?

183
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,400
I don't know. Go hunt.

184
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,600
Well, what happened in the game,
anyway?

185
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,200
What happened?

186
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,300
Well, they stunk!
That's what happened.

187
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,900
You know I almost wound up
going to that game?

188
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,600
You almost went to the game. You
haven't left the building in 10 years.

189
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,600
Yeah.

190
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
- You done with this?
- No.

191
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,100
- When you're done, let me know.
- Yeah, yeah.

192
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,200
You can have it tomorrow.

193
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,000
I thought I wasn't allowed
to be in here this weekend.

194
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,500
No, it's okay now.
That girl's not coming.

195
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,600
I misread the whole thing.

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,700
You want me to talk to her?

197
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,600
I don't think so.

198
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,400
No, I can be very persuasive.

199
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,400
You know that I was
almost a lawyer?

200
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,600
That close, huh?

201
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
You better believe it.

202
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,700
Hello.

203
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,200
Oh, hi, Laura.

204
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,200
- Oh, give me it. Let me talk.
- No. What's up?

205
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,300
- Well, let me talk to her.
- I'm always up at this hour.

206
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,800
How are you? Great.

207
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,300
Sure.

208
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
What time does the plane get in?

209
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,500
- I'll get my friend George to take me.
- Now slide!

210
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,100
Out. Do you believe that?

211
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,200
It's just my neighbor.

212
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,400
Yeah, I got it. 10: 15.

213
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,100
No, don't be silly.
Go ahead and ask.

214
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,200
Yeah, sure.

215
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,300
Okay, great. No, no.
It's no trouble at all.

216
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,200
I'll see you tomorrow.

217
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,300
Great. Bye.

218
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,300
I don't believe it.

219
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
That was her.
She wants to stay here.

220
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
If my father moved this,
he'd have a cigarette...

221
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,700
...in his mouth the whole way.
"Have you got your end?

222
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,400
Your end's got to come down first.
Easy, now. Drop it down.

223
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,800
Drop it down.
Your end's gotta come down."

224
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,500
You know, I can't believe you're
bringing in an extra bed...

225
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,600
...for a woman that wants
to sleep with you.

226
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,000
Why don't you bring in
an extra guy too.

227
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,200
Look, it's a very awkward situation.

228
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,300
- I don't wanna be presumptuous.
- All right.

229
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,100
One more time. One more time.

230
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,000
What was the exact phrasing
of the request?

231
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,400
All right. She said she couldn't
find a decent hotel room.

232
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,000
- A decent hotel room.
- Yeah, a decent hotel room.

233
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,900
Would it be terribly inconvenient
if she stayed at my place?

234
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,400
You can't be serious.

235
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,000
This is New York City. There must
be 11 million decent hotel rooms.

236
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,000
What do you need, a flag?

237
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,700
This is the signal, Jerry.

238
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,900
- This is the signal.
- This is the signal.

239
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,200
Thank you, Mr. Signal.
Where were you yesterday?

240
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,200
I think I was affected
by the caffeine.

241
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,000
Good dog. Good dog. All right.

242
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,600
Hey, he really likes you, George.

243
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,500
Well, that's flattering.

244
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,300
He's getting a drink of water.

245
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,000
- Is this for that girl?
- Yeah.

246
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,400
- Why even give her an option?
- This is a person I like.

247
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,800
It's not how to score
on spring break.

248
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,500
Can we go? I'm double-parked.
I'm gonna get a ticket.

249
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,600
Yeah, okay. Wait a second.
I forgot to clean the bathroom.

250
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,000
So what? That's good.

251
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,000
- How could that be good?
- Because filth is good.

252
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,600
What do you think, rock stars
have sponges and ammonia...

253
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,000
...lying around the bathroom?

254
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,600
You think they have a woman
coming over, "I gotta tidy up"?

255
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,100
In these matters, you never do
what instincts tell you.

256
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,000
Always, always do the opposite.

257
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,200
- This is how you operate?
- Yeah, I wish.

258
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,400
- Let me just wipe the sink.
- Why even give her an option for?

259
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
- It's unbelievable.
- Yeah.

260
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,600
How's the real estate business?

261
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,500
It's not bad. It's coming along.

262
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,800
Why, did you need something?

263
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
You handle any of that commercial...

264
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,500
...real estate that...?

265
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, I might be getting into that.

266
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,800
- You keep me posted.
- I'm aware of you. All right, let's go.

267
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,300
Let's go. You're on-stage
in 25 minutes.

268
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,100
The dating world is not a fun world.

269
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,800
It's a pressure world.

270
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,400
It's a world of tension,
it's a world of pain.

271
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,500
If a woman comes over to my house,
I gotta get that bathroom ready...

272
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,900
...because she needs things.
I don't know what.

273
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,200
I know I don't have it, I know that.

274
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,600
You know what they need?
Women need cotton balls.

275
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,100
This is one... Always been one of
the most amazing things to me.

276
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,500
I have no cotton balls.
We're all human beings.

277
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,000
What is the story?
I've never had one...

278
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,300
...I never bought one,
I never needed one.

279
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,900
I've never been in a situation
where I thought to myself:

280
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,900
"I could use a cotton ball right now.

281
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,600
I could certainly
get out of this mess."

282
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,100
Women need them.
And they don't need one or two.

283
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,700
They need thousands of them.
They need bags.

284
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,900
They're like peat moss bags.
Have you ever seen these giant bags?

285
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,300
They're huge...

286
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,600
...and two days later, they're out.
They're gone. The bag is empty.

287
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,500
Where are the cotton balls, ladies?
What are you doing with them?

288
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,400
The only time I ever see them
is in the bottom of wastebaskets.

289
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,200
Two or three look like they've been
through some horrible experience.

290
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Tortured, interrogated,
I don't know what happened to them.

291
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,400
I once went out with a girl, she left
a little bag of cotton balls at my house.

292
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,100
I didn't know what to do. I put them
on the floor like little tumbleweeds.

293
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,200
I thought cockroaches
would see it...

294
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,400
...figure, "This is a dead town.
Let's move on."

295
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,100
The dating world
is a world of pressure.

296
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,200
Let's face it, a date is a job interview
that lasts all night.

297
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,600
The difference between
a date and job interview is...

298
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:33,400
...not many interviews is there a
chance you'll end up naked at the end.

299
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,700
You know, " Bill, the boss thinks
you're the man for the position...

300
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,800
...strip down and meet the people
you'll be working with."

301
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,100
Wouldn't it be great if you could ask
a woman what she's thinking?

302
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,600
What a world it would be if you could
just ask a woman what she's thinking.

303
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,700
You know, instead I'm like a detective.
I gotta pick up clues.

304
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,900
The whole thing's
a murder investigation.

305
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,200
Listen, don't get worked up.
You're gonna know the whole story...

306
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,200
...the minute she steps off.
- Really, how?

307
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,000
It's all in the greeting. All right.

308
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,000
If she puts the bags down before
she greets you, that's a good sign.

309
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,800
- Anything in the lip area is good.
- Lip area.

310
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,400
- A hug, definitely good.
- Hug is definitely good.

311
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,000
What if it's one of those hugs
where the shoulders touch...

312
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
...the hips are eight feet apart?
- Brutal.

313
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,000
- You know how they do that?
- Also, a shake is bad.

314
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Shake is bad. But what if
it's the two-hander?

315
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,800
Hand on bottom, hand on top.
The warm look in the eyes.

316
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,100
- Hand sandwich?
- Right.

317
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,000
It's open to interpretation.
So much depends on the layering...

318
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,900
...the quality of the wetness
in the eyes...

319
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,700
- Guess who.
- Hey, hey. He...

320
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,700
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey.

321
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,900
- It's good to see you.
- Hi.

322
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
- This is my friend George.
- Oh, hi.

323
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,800
- How are you?
- This is Laura.

324
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
- Sure, Laura, sure.
- I can't believe you're here.

325
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,500
- Get the bags.
- Yeah, sure, the bags.

326
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,300
- Here, Laura. I'm sorry.
- Oh, thank you.

327
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,800
That was an interesting greeting.
Notice that, George?

328
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,800
Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting.

329
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,800
That wasn't in the manual.

330
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,400
So...

331
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,000
...what do you think?

332
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,800
This place isn't so bad.

333
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Yeah, it kind of motivates me
to work on the road.

334
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,400
So make yourself at home.

335
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,200
So can I get you anything?

336
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,000
Bread, water...

337
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,400
...salad dressing?

338
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,400
Actually, do you have any wine?

339
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,800
Yeah, I think I do.

340
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,000
Do you mind if I turn this down?

341
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,700
No. Yeah, go...
Go right ahead. Yeah.

342
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Jerry, I was wondering...

343
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,900
...would it be possible,
and if it's not, fine...

344
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,400
...for me to stay here
tomorrow night too?

345
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,800
Yeah. Yeah, sure.
Yeah, why don't you stay.

346
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,400
Yeah.

347
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,000
What is your schedule
for tomorrow?

348
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,400
Are you doing anything?

349
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,800
No, I'd love to do something.

350
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,500
I have my seminar in the morning,
but after I'm wide open.

351
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,300
Really? What would you like to do?

352
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,800
Well...

353
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
...I know this sounds touristy,
but I'd love to go on one of those...

354
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,600
...five-hour boat rides
around Manhattan.

355
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,400
Yeah, we could do that.

356
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,800
Why not? Why not?

357
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,700
I'm just... I'm really glad you're here.

358
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,400
Hello.

359
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,800
Yes.

360
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,200
Yes, she is. Hold on.

361
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,200
It's for you.

362
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,400
Hello?

363
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,700
Hi.

364
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,800
No, no. It was great, right on time.

365
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,300
No, I'm gonna stay here tomorrow.

366
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,200
Yes. Yes, it's fine.

367
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,100
No, we're going on a boat ride.

368
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,700
Don't be silly.

369
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,100
I'm not gonna have
this conversation.

370
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,000
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.

371
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,800
Okay. Bye.

372
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,300
Never get engaged.

373
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,300
You're engaged?

374
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,900
You know, you really have no idea
what it's like until you do it.

375
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,200
I'm on this emotional roller coaster.

376
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,700
You're engaged?

377
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,400
You know, I can't believe it
myself sometimes.

378
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,000
You have to start thinking
in terms of "we."

379
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,800
- It's a very stressful situation.
- You're engaged.

380
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,400
- Yeah, he's a great guy.
- Yeah.

381
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,500
You'd really like him.

382
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,800
- I can't wait to get on that boat.
- Me too.

383
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,200
I swear, I have absolutely no idea
what women are thinking.

384
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,100
I don't get it, okay?
I admit, I'm not getting the signals.

385
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,800
I am not getting it.

386
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Women, they're so subtle. Their little...
Everything they do is subtle.

387
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,000
Men are not subtle. We are obvious.

388
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,400
Women know what men want,
men know what men want.

389
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,800
What do we want?
We want women. That's it.

390
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,100
It's the only thing we know for sure.
It really is.

391
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,800
We want women.
How do we get them?

392
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,600
We don't know about that.
We don't know.

393
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,800
The next step after that,
we have no idea.

394
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,600
This is why you see men honking car
horns, yelling from construction sites.

395
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,200
These are the best ideas
we've had so far.

396
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,800
The car horn honk.
Is that the beauty?

397
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,100
Have you seen men doing this?

398
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
What is this? The man is in the car.

399
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,300
The woman walks by
the front of the car.

400
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,800
He honks the...

401
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,600
This man is out of ideas.

402
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,000
How does the...?

403
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,400
I don't think she likes me.

404
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,400
The amazing thing is that we still
get women, don't we?

405
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,200
I mean, men are with women.

406
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,900
You see men with women.

407
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,000
How are men getting women?
Many people wonder.

408
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,400
Let me tell you a little bit
about our organization.

409
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,000
Wherever women are, we have a man
working on the situation right now.

410
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,400
Now, he may not be our best man...

411
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,700
...okay, we have a lot of areas
to cover...

412
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,600
...but someone from our staff
is on the scene.

413
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,200
That's why men get frustrated...

414
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,200
...when we see women
reading articles...

415
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,700
...like "Where to Meet Men."

416
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,700
We're here. We are everywhere.

417
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,700
We're honking our horns
to serve you better.

418
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
