1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,398
Old people in Florida,
they drive slow...

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,598
...and they sit low.

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,111
Right? That is their motto.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,391
The state flag of Florida should be...

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,915
...a steering wheel with a hat
and two knuckles on it.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,232
And that left-turn signal on...

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,039
...from when they left the house
that morning.

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,510
Right? That's a legal turn in Florida.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,758
It's known as an eventual left.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,272
And old people
get to a certain age...

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,396
...where, when they back out
of the driveway...

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,198
...they don't look.

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,112
You know what I mean?
They just feel like:

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,716
"Well, I'm old, and I'm coming back.

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,510
I survived. Let's see if you can."

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,194
- Hey, you're back!
- Oh, I'm back, baby.

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,510
- How was it?
- One of the best jobs I ever had.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,352
- Good for you.
- I killed.

19
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,317
- You killed.
- Wiped the floor with them.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,994
And not only that,
the money was unbelievable.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,277
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah, highest-paying job I ever had.

22
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,714
How much?

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,472
- I'd rather not.
- Oh, come on.

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,359
It's not good to talk about money.
It can affect the friendship.

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,873
I tell you how much I make.

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,519
And I'm always impressed.

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,636
Just show me the check. Come on.

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,631
- You wanna see it?
- I wanna see it.

29
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,313
Okay.

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,637
Check that out.

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,550
- This is unbelievable.
- I told you.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,188
My God, you're rich.

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,588
Oh, yeah.

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,194
I didn't know you made
that kind of money.

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,398
- Gee.
- What?

36
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,155
I just don't think
I can talk to you anymore.

37
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,914
I feel inferior.

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,839
I never should have told you.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,878
You know, Jerry, I think
this changes the relationship.

40
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,758
I mean, I feel it. Do you feel it?

41
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,558
No, I can't feel anything.

42
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,312
What are you gonna do with all that?

43
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,313
I was thinking of donating
a large portion of it to charity.

44
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,198
- Really?
- No.

45
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,039
Well, you should, Jerry.

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,998
To tell you the truth, I was thinking
of buying my father a car.

47
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,196
- You see, that's nice.
- Yeah, maybe a Cadillac.

48
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,679
Cadillac.

49
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,114
Yeah.

50
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,430
That would blow his mind.
He's always wanted one...

51
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,989
...his whole life. He's never
been able to afford it.

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,071
- I'll do it.
- You're gonna score big points...

53
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,593
...with the man upstairs.

54
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,876
Oh, isn't that what it's all about?

55
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,757
Who was Pippi Longstocking?

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,912
Pippi Longstocking? I don't know.

57
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,833
Did she have anything
to do with Hitler?

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,877
Hitler? Maybe.

59
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,679
- Hey.
- Hey, George.

60
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,798
Have you seen Jerry?
I told him 2:00.

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,995
You remember Katy?

62
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,794
Oh, hi.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

63
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,520
We met skiing that time.
You're married to the eye guy.

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,478
Also ear, nose and throat.

65
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,833
Nose.

66
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,550
What's the worst
that could happen to a nose?

67
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,551
What does it get, stuffed?

68
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,070
- He's funny.
- You don't have to tell me.

69
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,071
Ladies, please, please.

70
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,196
Oh, you know what?
He got engaged.

71
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,828
Oh, you did?

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,911
What, is that bad?

73
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,548
I actually would have set you up
with a friend of mine.

74
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,154
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

75
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,312
You'd be perfect for her.
She loves quirky, funny guys.

76
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,199
- Bald?
- Loves bald.

77
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,191
Loves bald.

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,674
Who...?

79
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,270
- Who is she?
- Marisa Tomei.

80
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,520
- The actress?
- Yeah.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,752
You're friends with Marisa Tomei?

82
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,509
That's right.

83
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,194
That's incredible. My Cousin Vinny...

84
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,828
I love her. She was fantastic.

85
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,634
Yeah, I know.

86
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,472
You were gonna fix me up with her?

87
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,073
She's just been sitting home.

88
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,595
Marisa Tomei's sitting home, Elaine.

89
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,955
Why didn't you tell me
Katy was friends with Marisa?

90
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,759
Oh, I don't know
what I was thinking.

91
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,319
I want this baby fully loaded.

92
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,158
Well, how soon can you get it there?

93
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,953
Oh, that's terrific.

94
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,759
Okay, thanks, bye.
Hey, guess what.

95
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,878
- I just bought my father a Cadillac.
- Really?

96
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,712
- Wow, you are quite the good son.
- Yeah.

97
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,108
I'm a very good boy.

98
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,316
I'm flying down there
and surprising them.

99
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,438
- You gonna sleep on the foldout?
- Yeah.

100
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,999
I guess.

101
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,037
Let me ask you something.

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,033
You ever hear of Marisa Tomei?

103
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,269
- The actress?
- Yeah.

104
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,238
- She's... She's something, isn't she?
- Oh, yeah.

105
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,358
- Well, you know Katy, Elaine's friend?
- Yeah.

106
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,351
She happens to be
good friends with her.

107
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,192
Marisa Tomei?

108
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,397
- How does she know Marisa Tomei?
- I don't know. I didn't ask.

109
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,279
You didn't ask
how she knows Marisa Tomei?

110
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,079
- Not the point. Can I finish?
- All right.

111
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,473
Go ahead.
Seems like a reasonable question.

112
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,949
That's all I'm saying.
I would have asked her.

113
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,838
All right!

114
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,277
So she said that she could have
fixed me up with her.

115
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,919
What do you mean, "could have"?

116
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,917
Well, you know, if I wasn't engaged.

117
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,951
Could have fixed me up
with Marisa Tomei.

118
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,473
She said I was just her type.

119
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,551
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

120
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,518
Do you know the odds
of me being anyone's type?

121
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,113
I have never been anyone's type.

122
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,751
But, apparently, this Marisa Tomei
loves funny, quirky bald men.

123
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,516
You know, she won
an Academy Award.

124
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,997
Like I don't know that.

125
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,071
My Cousin Vinny, I loved it.

126
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,755
I, George Costanza, could be
on a date with an Oscar winner.

127
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,309
An Oscar winner, Jerry.
Do you know what that's like?

128
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,199
If 50 years ago someone had fixed
me up with Katharine Hepburn.

129
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,998
Same thing.

130
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,199
Now there's a match,
you and Katharine Hepburn.

131
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,069
- I mean, you've seen her?
- Katharine Hepburn? Yeah.

132
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,231
- Marisa Tomei!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

133
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,960
I mean, she's beautiful, right.
She's just my type.

134
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,111
The dark hair, the full lips.

135
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,111
- You like full lips.
- Oh, I love full lips.

136
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,158
Something you can really
put the lipstick on.

137
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,960
Too bad you're engaged.

138
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,269
Yeah, too bad, too bad.

139
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,438
This is no good.

140
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,079
- Hi.
- Hi.

141
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,948
Excuse me, I'm with Plaza Cable.
I'm sorry to bother you.

142
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,236
I'm looking for the guy
who lives over here.

143
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,153
Been waiting about two hours.

144
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,639
You happen to know where he is?

145
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,074
No.

146
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,310
Could you tell him
the cable company was here?

147
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,630
- Sure.
- Thank you.

148
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,392
- Nice people.
- Yeah.

149
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,269
Listen, let me ask you a question.

150
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,437
What if I got a cup of coffee
with her?

151
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,599
Well, what about Susan?

152
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,352
I can't have a coffee with a person?

153
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,839
I'm not allowed to have coffee?

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,274
Would you tell Susan about it?

155
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,679
Not necessarily.

156
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,593
If you can't tell Susan about it,
then there's something wrong.

157
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,990
Of course there's something wrong.

158
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,513
We had a pact.

159
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,915
- Hey, cable guy's looking for you.
- Oh, yeah?

160
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,834
Yeah.

161
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,072
Yeah, I've been getting HBO
for free.

162
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,913
They found out about it.
Now they wanna come and take it out.

163
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,674
Well, said he was waiting two hours.
Seemed a little put out.

164
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,639
Oh, was he?

165
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,839
Well, I guess the cable man
doesn't like to be kept waiting.

166
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,718
You don't seem too bothered by it.

167
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,110
Do you remember what they did to me
10 years ago?

168
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,589
"Oh, we'll be there in the morning
between 9 and 1...

169
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,275
...or we'll be there between 2 and 6."

170
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,477
And I sat there, hour after hour...

171
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,837
...without so much as a phone call.

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,150
Finally, they show up.

173
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,548
No apology.

174
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,393
Tracking mud all over
my nice, clean floors.

175
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,269
And now they want me
to accommodate them.

176
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,634
Well...

177
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,156
...looks like the shoe
is on the other foot, doesn't it?

178
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,315
- I've never seen you like this.
- You don't wanna get on my bad side.

179
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,393
- marks without Positraction...

180
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,553
...which was not available
on the '64 Buick Skylark.

181
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,312
Hey.

182
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,711
Hey, what are you watching?

183
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,069
What is that, My Cousin Vinny?

184
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,592
- Yeah.
- I thought you saw that before.

185
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,557
How come you're watching
that again?

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,355
I don't know.

187
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,751
Did you know Marisa Tomei
won an Oscar for that?

188
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,992
Boy, she's beautiful, don't you think?
I wish I looked like that.

189
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,872
Turn it off.
You're making me jealous.

190
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,554
I'm gonna think you like her
more than you like me.

191
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,072
- Hello?
- Elaine, it's me, George.

192
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,071
- How come you're whispering?
- Never mind.

193
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,629
Never mind.
I need you to do me a favour.

194
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,189
Remember what we were talking
about at the coffee shop?

195
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,634
No.

196
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,828
Think a second.

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,833
You know, your friend was talking
about me and, you know...

198
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,833
George, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,956
- The actress.
- What?

200
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,192
Marisa Tomei!

201
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,158
- What?
- Nothing. Nothing.

202
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,514
Oh, yeah.

203
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,240
- Yeah, what about her?
- Well...

204
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,992
...I think I'd like to do it.
- What?

205
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,354
What?

206
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,829
George, no way. You're engaged.

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,558
A coffee.
That doesn't mean anything.

208
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,071
- No, George.
- Elaine.

209
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,629
- Forget it.
- Elaine.

210
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,870
Elaine! Don't!

211
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,155
The judge! I hate this guy.

212
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,190
I can't believe you're buying
your father a car.

213
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,271
And best of all, it's a Cadillac.

214
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,790
A Cadillac?

215
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,792
I had no idea you had
this kind of money.

216
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,638
I don't like to talk about it.

217
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,189
Yeah, I mean,
I thought you were doing okay.

218
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,069
I just didn't think you were
in this kind of, you know...

219
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,758
...position.

220
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,398
It's just money.

221
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,557
So when are you getting back
from Florida?

222
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,396
Oh, I don't know.
I'll play it by ear. Why?

223
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,234
I don't know, just...

224
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,756
Things seem a little more exciting
when you're around.

225
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,553
That's all.

226
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,513
Are you okay?

227
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,399
Sure, sure.

228
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,993
- What was that?
- Quiet, quiet.

229
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,714
Hey, you know the guy
who lives here?

230
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,348
- Yeah.
- All morning I've been waiting here.

231
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,988
- All morning.
- Oh, this is...

232
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,955
The guy says he's gonna be home.
I show up, and all I do is wait.

233
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,830
I'm getting pretty sick and tired of it.

234
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,797
I'm not gonna put up with it
much longer.

235
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,076
I'm loving this.

236
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,719
Hey, there's a guy out here that...

237
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,472
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know, I know.

238
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,959
Thanks very much for yesterday,
by the way.

239
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,998
Jerry, he wants me to fix him up
with Marisa Tomei.

240
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,991
I am not gonna be a part of this.

241
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,072
"Fixed up"? A cup of coffee.
A cup of coffee is not a fix-up.

242
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,913
You wanna meet her.
You wanna see if she likes you?

243
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,719
- So what? So what if I do?
- You're engaged!

244
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,269
I'm aware! I'm aware!

245
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,432
But this is Marisa Tomei, Elaine.
An Oscar winner.

246
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,192
How can I live the rest of my life...

247
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,998
...knowing I could have been
with her?

248
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,434
She said I was just her type.

249
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,398
She loves short, stocky,
balding funnymen.

250
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,473
I notice you threw "stocky" in.

251
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,073
Yeah, what the hell.

252
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,231
George, it's cheating.

253
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,960
It's not cheating if there's no sex.

254
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,190
Yes, it is. Jerry.

255
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,956
Hundred. Hold on a second.

256
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,230
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear what you said.

257
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,629
Elaine, come on.

258
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,870
Would you make the call?
Please, make the call.

259
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,871
Yeah. Yeah, fine. I'll call.

260
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,194
- Eight fifty.
- Oh, right.

261
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,112
So...

262
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,875
...how are you getting to the airport?
Do you need a ride, or...?

263
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,840
- Don't be silly. I've arranged a car.
- You sure? You sure?

264
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,752
Because, you know...

265
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,598
- Maybe I'll let you pick me up.
- Okay.

266
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,552
Oh, hi.

267
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,597
Is Katy there?

268
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,434
What?

269
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,431
Oh, really?

270
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,830
Well, could you tell her
Elaine called?

271
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,797
Yeah, thanks.

272
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,360
She's in the hospital.
She has an arrhythmia.

273
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,915
What about Marisa Tomei?

274
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,110
Morty, what do you have to open
this box for?

275
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,236
There's already
a box of cookies open.

276
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,549
I wanted a Chip Ahoy.

277
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,711
I don't want all these open boxes.

278
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,438
Look, I got a few good years left.

279
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,433
If I want a Chip Ahoy, I'm having it.

280
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,239
Surprise!

281
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,834
- Jerry!
- Oh, my God!

282
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,719
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm a good son.

283
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,518
Just like that? No call?

284
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,796
- Just like that.
- Oh, you are really something.

285
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,359
To what do we owe this honour?

286
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,033
You wanna know, come on outside.

287
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,519
Outside? What's going on?

288
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,989
Whenever Jerry comes,
something exciting happens.

289
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,559
Come on, come on.

290
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,349
- Well, what do you think?
- Look at this.

291
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,752
Look at this.

292
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,353
You bought a Cadillac?

293
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,317
I bought it for you. It's yours.

294
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,675
You what?
You bought me a Cadillac?

295
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,910
I bought you a Cadillac.
Here you go.

296
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,513
Are you out of your mind?

297
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,113
- What?
- We can't take this.

298
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,838
You don't want it? Are you kidding?

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,468
- He's not buying us a Cadillac.
- What are you, nuts?

300
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,108
This is a very nice gesture, Jerry,
but take it back.

301
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,759
Can you believe this?

302
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,798
I'm not letting him buy us a Cadillac.
He hasn't got the money.

303
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,758
- How do you know?
- Oh, get out of here, Mr. Big Shot.

304
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,433
Why can't I buy my father a car?

305
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,477
- Your father doesn't need a car.
- Yes, I do.

306
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,232
- Oh, Morty.
- We're keeping it.

307
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,595
Over my dead body.
Give me those. Give me...

308
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,990
Well, this worked out
just as I had hoped.

309
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,195
- Giddyup.
- Yeah, this is Nick Stevens...

310
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,918
...from Plaza Cable.

311
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,196
Well, I waited all morning again.

312
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,271
You said you were gonna be there
from 9 to 1.

313
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,829
I was there. Where were you?

314
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,274
I got nothing better to do...

315
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,273
...than stand outside all morning
waiting for you to show up?

316
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,874
You're not gonna
get away with this.

317
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,232
Hey, Jerry, look at this.

318
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,789
My seat's got a memory,
in case somebody moves it.

319
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,279
I could be in prison for years.

320
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,476
I come out, my seat goes back
to where I like it.

321
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,119
That's what I was thinking.

322
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,478
Hello, Jerry.

323
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,959
Hiya, Jack.

324
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,519
So...

325
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,999
...how do you like this?

326
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,912
- Whose car?
- It's mine.

327
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,593
- Yours?
- That's right.

328
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,910
- My son bought it for me.
- He what?

329
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,274
My son bought me the car.

330
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,634
It's a present.

331
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,030
- You bought it?
- That's right. I bought it.

332
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,428
You ever see one so nice?

333
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,749
Some car.

334
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,150
- You wanna take a ride?
- No, thank you.

335
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,197
- Come on, take a ride.
- I don't wanna ride.

336
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,430
- Why not?
- I don't feel like taking a ride.

337
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,919
Do I have to take a ride?

338
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,513
He doesn't wanna take a ride.

339
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,069
What do you think,
I've never ridden in a Cadillac?

340
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,118
Believe me, I have ridden
in a Cadillac hundreds of times.

341
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,032
- Thousands.
- Thousands?

342
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,237
You think you're such a big shot now
because you got a Cadillac?

343
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,515
Did you believe that guy?

344
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,034
Anyway, I was thinking
about what you said...

345
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,348
...about me and Marisa, you know,
the two of us getting together.

346
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,671
And I know that I said
that I was engaged...

347
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,231
...but, you know, it's really just
something you say, you know.

348
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,631
It's like going steady, you know.
Going steady, engaged.

349
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,155
It's all just stuff you say.

350
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,520
Anyway, I was watching
My Cousin Vinny...

351
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,468
...on the tape the other day
and I was thinking that...

352
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,349
...you know, the two of us
might take a meeting, as they say.

353
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,391
So, what do you think?

354
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,035
Move a pinkie if it's yes.
Can you move a pinkie?

355
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,474
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Kramer.

356
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,790
This is McNab
down at the phone company.

357
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,191
We got a report
about some trouble on your line.

358
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,909
Well, I haven't had any trouble.

359
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,436
Thing is, we happen to have a man
right in your neighbourhood.

360
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,512
Is that right? Well, I have been having
a little trouble with my call waiting.

361
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,591
We can fix that. We can fix that.

362
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,318
Oh, can you?

363
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,630
Well, that's funny.
Because as it happens...

364
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,677
...I don't have call waiting.

365
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,037
Seems to me that the phone company
would know that.

366
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,679
Oh, right, I'm sorry.

367
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,310
I was looking at the wrong
work order.

368
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,913
Could you hold on for a second?

369
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,799
I've got something on the stove.

370
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:22,196
Hey, McNab!
Chunnel's on HBO tonight!

371
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,828
Why don't you stop by!

372
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,790
All right. Next thing on the agenda:

373
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,474
The restoration of the fence
at the Broward Gate.

374
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,712
At the present time,
we are still accepting bids.

375
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,711
It's been broken
for six months already.

376
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,074
What the hell are you doing?

377
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,879
Well, I, as your president,
have to find the best price.

378
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,838
And right now, I, for one,
do not think it's cost-feasible.

379
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,514
I'll bet you don't.

380
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,749
What's that?

381
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,878
Come on, Morty. The jig is up.

382
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,792
- What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

383
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,077
I'm sitting here the whole meeting
holding my tongue.

384
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,676
I know you a long time, Morty,
but I cannot hold it in any longer.

385
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,400
- What's going on, Jack?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

386
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,075
Morty Seinfeld has been
stealing funds from the treasury.

387
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,071
- Stealing?
- What proof do you have?

388
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,593
Proof? You want proof?

389
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,115
He's driving around
in a brand-new Cadillac.

390
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,599
What more proof do you want?

391
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,318
My son bought me that car.

392
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,950
Your son? Your son could never
afford that car.

393
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,078
We all saw his act
last year at the playhouse.

394
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,756
He's lucky he can pay his rent.

395
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,593
Jack's right. He stinks.

396
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,954
It's his material.

397
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,509
I tell you, he bought it for me.

398
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,717
- I move for a full investigation.
- I second.

399
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,272
- Impeachment?
- That's right.

400
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,078
Have you ever heard anything
like that?

401
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,754
- Can they do that?
- lf they get the votes.

402
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,070
Told you we shouldn't have let him
give us the car.

403
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,879
Didn't you tell them I got the bill?
That proves I paid for it.

404
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,191
It doesn't make a difference.
They think we're in cahoots.

405
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,237
You could put a fence around these
condos and call it an insane asylum.

406
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,992
Nobody would know the difference.

407
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,991
No one's ever
been impeached before.

408
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,436
I couldn't live here.
We'd have to move to Boca.

409
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,833
Hello?

410
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,878
- Oh, hi, Evelyn.
- Hello, Jerry.

411
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,238
I just got off the phone
with Sol Brandes.

412
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,756
- What did he say?
- He's voting to impeach.

413
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,231
Not because he thinks
you stole the money...

414
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,550
...but mainly because you never
thanked him...

415
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,757
...for giving you his aisle seat
at Freddy Roman's show.

416
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,199
I did so thank him.

417
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,033
No, he never heard you.
I told you he didn't hear you.

418
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,952
He's deaf anyway.

419
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,635
Now, my sources tell me...

420
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,189
...there's three votes
for impeachment...

421
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,157
...three votes
against impeachment...

422
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,356
...and one undecided.

423
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,431
- Who's that?
- Mrs. Choate.

424
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,874
- Who's she?
- Oh, that one?

425
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,270
She's been a member of the board
longer than anybody.

426
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,759
She's very tough to deal with.

427
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,515
Maybe we should have her over
for coffee and explain our side of it.

428
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,114
- That's a good idea.
- Okay.

429
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,316
I'll see you
at the Lichtenbergs' tonight.

430
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,233
- The Lichtenbergs'?
- Yes, they're having a party.

431
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,958
We weren't invited.

432
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,233
Well.

433
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,790
Probably they think
you're too good for them.

434
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,520
You know, because of the car.

435
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,794
We're losing all our friends.

436
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,671
- Hello?
- Hello, Mr. Kramer?

437
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,432
This is John Hanaran from Con Ed.

438
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,717
- Oh, it's Hanaran now, is it?
- Yes.

439
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,678
We've had some reports
of power surges in your building.

440
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,592
It seems some jok ers
were up on the roof.

441
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,512
They must have damaged
some of the wires.

442
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,910
Oh, you don't say.

443
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,389
Either way, we need to get
into your apartment...

444
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,073
...and do a safety check.

445
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,235
Oh, you're good.

446
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,994
You are really good.

447
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,359
What are you talking about?

448
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,949
I guess I should just
go introduce myself, huh?

449
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,998
Hey, what are you watching?

450
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,591
Only You?

451
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,395
That's another Marisa Tomei movie.

452
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,152
And you've seen that one too.

453
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,595
What, do you have a thing for her?

454
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,595
Yeah. Yeah, I have a thing
for Marisa Tomei.

455
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,719
Like she would ever go out
with a short, stocky, bald man.

456
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,438
Like that's her type.

457
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,397
She's an Oscar winner.

458
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,832
Besides, I don't even know her.

459
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,878
It's not like anyone's
trying to fix us up.

460
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,589
Who would try and fix me up
with Marisa Tomei?

461
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,069
What are you talking about?

462
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,038
Have I told you
how much I love you today?

463
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,071
Not in the last 15 minutes.

464
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,631
Well, I do love you very much.

465
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,870
And I love you, Marisa.

466
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,437
Well, then. Come on, get dressed.

467
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,477
We're going to be late
for the premiere.

468
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,270
Stupid foldout.

469
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,591
Why do they put the bar
in the middle of the bed?

470
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,918
- Hello?
- Hi, Jerry.

471
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,676
Elaine? What's going on?

472
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,639
I was thinking. I mean, I'm not really
doing that much this weekend...

473
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,155
...and I thought, "Well, what the hell.

474
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,039
Maybe I'll come down there
and hang out a little."

475
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,395
You wanna hang out here...

476
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,233
...at Phase Two
in the Pines of Mar Gables?

477
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,794
Well...

478
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,871
...it's just two hours by plane.

479
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,315
Gee, I don't know what to tell you.

480
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,592
Damn it. I got another call.

481
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,149
Hang on. Don't hang up, Jerry.

482
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,554
- Yeah?
- Elaine...

483
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,756
...you have got to get me
Marisa Tomei's number.

484
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,595
Okay, George, I'm on the other line.
I promise you, I'll get you her number.

485
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,160
- Yeah.
- Goodbye.

486
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,033
Hi.

487
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,953
Hi.

488
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,674
So, what do you think?

489
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,913
I don't think so.

490
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,233
I'll be back on Monday.

491
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,677
Well, if you need that ride...

492
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,593
...just give me a call.

493
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,512
I can meet you at the gate, Jerr.

494
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,954
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

495
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,270
- All right, I'll see you.
- Jerr, Jerry?

496
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,396
- Yeah?
- Bye.

497
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,799
Bye.

498
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,312
Yeah, sure. No, that's fantastic.

499
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,278
I'll... I'll see you then.

500
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,953
Okay.

501
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,916
I just got off the phone
with Marisa Tomei.

502
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,640
I just spoke to Marisa Tomei.

503
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,438
And I wasn't even that nervous.

504
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,955
I can't remember calling
a woman without being nervous.

505
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,590
Usually I'm pacing all over the room.
I write down things to say.

506
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,755
Okay, well, that's all the time
we have for today.

507
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,434
Why don't we pick up
with this next week?

508
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,352
- Where are you going?
- I got stuff to do.

509
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,431
- What? You can't leave yet.
- Why not?

510
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,875
- We have to discuss my alibi.
- Alibi?

511
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,429
- What does that have to do with me?
- I spend Saturday...

512
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,716
...with Susan. She'll wanna know
what I'm doing.

513
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,871
I can't use Jerry.
He's in Florida.

514
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,679
- So you wanna say you were with me?
- Yes.

515
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,118
Okay, fine. You were with me.

516
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,316
Wait a second. Wait a second.
What were we doing?

517
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,789
Where were we?
Why are we together?

518
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,759
- What is the difference?
- Because if you ever see her...

519
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,037
...and it comes up,
we have to be in sync.

520
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,113
Okay. Now...

521
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,958
Why do I have to see you?

522
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,714
Because I'm going to the dentist...

523
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,438
...and I'm afraid...

524
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,830
...and I want you to go with me.

525
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,912
That's no good.

526
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,115
Okay, fine.

527
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,429
What?

528
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,114
I don't like the way you
just rejected my suggestion.

529
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,272
Hey, let's not get so defensive here.
This is a give-and-take process.

530
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,874
I thought that
my suggestion was good.

531
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,110
I think you could have
been a little more tactful.

532
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,636
Okay, look, we've never
worked together on a lie.

533
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,598
You don't understand how I work.
I have a certain way of working.

534
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,558
Jerry and I have worked together
a few times. He knows how I work.

535
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,793
Not a personal thing. We're just trying
to come up with the best possible lie.

536
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,473
- That's what this is about.
- Okay.

537
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,993
- Okay. Fine.
- Okay?

538
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,469
- Good.
- Fine, fine, fine.

539
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,392
Okay.

540
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,717
Okay, how about this?

541
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,313
- What?
- You are having problems...

542
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,314
...with your boyfriend, and I am
meeting you to discuss the situation.

543
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,833
I don't have a boyfriend.

544
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,150
She doesn't know that.
We say that you do.

545
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,437
It's good. Believe me.

546
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,114
I thought my idea was just as good.

547
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,397
- The dentist thing?
- Yeah, right. The dentist thing.

548
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,472
- The dentist thing was not good.
- Okay, all right.

549
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,358
What is his name? Who is he?

550
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,434
Art Vandelay.

551
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,077
Art Vandelay?

552
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,390
- This is my boyfriend?
- That's your boyfriend.

553
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,472
What does he do?

554
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,677
- He's an importer.
- Just imports? No exports?

555
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,711
He's an importer-exporter.
Okay?

556
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,950
So I'm dating Art Vandelay.

557
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,077
What is the problem
we're discussing?

558
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,959
Yes, yes.

559
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,719
How about this?

560
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,190
How about he's thinking
of quitting the exporting...

561
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,193
...and just focusing in
on the importing.

562
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,478
And this is causing a problem.
Because why not do both?

563
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:31,313
Oh, what? You don't like
that suggestion either?

564
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,831
It's very complicated.

565
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,437
You know, it seems to me
that it's all you...

566
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,477
...and none of my ideas
are getting in.

567
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,191
You know, I mean, you just know it all.
And I am Miss Stupid, right?

568
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,671
What are you doing?
Are you making coffee?

569
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,115
- Yeah.
- You better make a pot of tea too.

570
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,838
Morty, you're driving me crazy.

571
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,672
Look, I don't want anything
to go wrong.

572
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,354
If this woman votes to impeach me,
I'll be a laughingstock.

573
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,195
You wanna drive a Cadillac,
expect to pay the consequences.

574
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,998
There she is.

575
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,788
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Choate.

576
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,110
- Hello.
- Oh, come in. May I take your coat?

577
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,158
No, no. I prefer to wear it.
Nobody's taking my coat.

578
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,151
How about a cup
of coffee or something?

579
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,594
Coffee?

580
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,388
I'll take hot water
with lemon if you have it.

581
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,073
Please, have a seat.

582
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,312
That's a lovely scarf you're wearing.
Where did you get it?

583
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,516
They're a dime a dozen.

584
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,513
Oh, hi, Jerry. Mrs. Choate,
this is my son, Jerry.

585
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,879
- Give me that rye.
- Stop it.

586
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,553
Help! Someone help!

587
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,188
- Shut up, you old bag.
- Thief!

588
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,875
Stop him! Stop him,
he's got my rye!

589
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,000
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

590
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,390
Jerry lives in New York.
You just came from New York?

591
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,836
Yeah, I was visiting my daughter.
And I'll never go back.

592
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,429
The crime there is just terrible.

593
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,990
Do you know I got mugged
for a marble rye right on the street?

594
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,835
Oh, that's terrible. They stole a rye?
Why would they steal a rye?

595
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,719
That's what the city's turning into.
They'll steal anything.

596
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,995
They're like savages.

597
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,357
Yeah, there are some sickos
out there.

598
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,478
You look very familiar.
Have we ever met?

599
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,754
You ever go to Camp Tioga?

600
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,433
Maybe you've seen him
on television.

601
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,876
- Jerry's a comedian.
- No, I don't watch TV.

602
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,792
- It was nice meeting you.
- Jerry, don't go.

603
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,632
No, I think I'll go.

604
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,400
So, Morty, what's this all about?
What do you want?

605
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,431
Hey, where are you going?

606
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,033
Oh, l... I didn't tell you?

607
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,077
I gotta go meet Elaine.

608
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,992
Elaine? What for?

609
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,232
I don't know. She's having some
problems with this guy she's seeing.

610
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,113
I didn't know
she was dating anyone.

611
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,352
Yeah, yeah. She's seeing
this guy, Art Vandelay.

612
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,714
- So, what does he do?
- He's an importer-exporter.

613
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,632
What kind of problems
are they having?

614
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,275
Well, he...

615
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,798
He wants to quit
the exporting and...

616
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,590
...focus just on the importing.

617
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,320
And it's a problem because
she thinks the exporting...

618
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,119
...is as important as the importing.

619
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,350
Are you having
an affair with Elaine?

620
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,875
Right. Come on.

621
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,158
I'm having an affair with Elaine?
If I was having an affair with Elaine...

622
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,231
...I wouldn't tell you
I'm seeing Elaine.

623
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,834
I would make up another person
to tell you I would see...

624
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,355
...and then I would go see Elaine.

625
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,513
I'll get you! I'll get you, Kramer!

626
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,310
You won't get away with this.

627
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,673
All right, are you ready to eat?

628
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:18,996
Oh, right, let's go. Jerry, let's go.
It's time to eat. We're going to dinner.

629
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,718
- Dinner? Well, what time is it?
- It's 4:30.

630
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,748
Four thirty?
Who eats dinner at 4:30?

631
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,388
By the time we sit down,
it'll be quarter to 5.

632
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,472
I don't understand
why we have to eat now.

633
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,837
We gotta catch the early-bird.
It's only between 4:30 and 6.

634
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,515
Yeah, they give you a tenderloin,
a salad and a baked potato for $4.95.

635
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,989
You know what that
costs you after 6?

636
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,118
Can't we eat at a decent hour?
I'll treat. Okay?

637
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,793
You're not buying us dinner.

638
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,395
I'm not force-feeding
myself a steak at 4:30...

639
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,869
...to save a couple bucks.
I'll tell you that.

640
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,599
All right.

641
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,193
We'll wait.

642
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,232
But it's unheard of.

643
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,189
So anyway, if you think about it...

644
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,237
..."manure" is not really
that bad a word.

645
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,198
I mean, it's "newer," which is good.

646
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,432
And a "ma" in front of it,
which is also good.

647
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,160
"Manure." It's really not that bad.

648
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,750
You're so right.
I never thought of it like that.

649
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,230
"Manure." "Ma" and the "newer."

650
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,588
Did you just make that up?

651
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,713
What, you think I'm doing material?

652
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,154
No, no.

653
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,154
It's hard to believe anyone
could be so spontaneously funny.

654
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,390
And I'm a little tired.

655
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,113
So tell me:

656
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,589
How is it that a man like you...

657
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,673
...so bald and so quirky
and funny...?

658
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,434
How is it you're not taken?

659
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,597
Well, Marisa...

660
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,910
...you see, the thing is...

661
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,990
...l'm sort of engaged.

662
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,514
What?

663
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,478
I'm, you know, "engaged."

664
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,471
- Hey, look, there's a spot right in front.
- Always, Jerry. Always.

665
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,795
Was that delicious or what?

666
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,518
Where you gonna get
a better meal?

667
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,954
It's better than Danny's.

668
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,076
Danny's? Come on.

669
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,514
- Hello, Jack.
- Doris.

670
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,398
- Hi, Jack. Hi, Doris.
- Jerry.

671
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,391
Hello, Morty.

672
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,039
Well, you missed the early-bird.

673
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,758
Yeah? So?

674
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,195
Must be nice to have
that kind of money.

675
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,199
Bernie.

676
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,828
Look who's eating at 6:00.

677
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,117
Your suddenly well-to-do president.

678
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,157
Stop it, Jack.

679
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,232
You enjoy your last meal in office.

680
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,152
Tomorrow, when they kick you out...

681
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,233
...you'll have plenty of time
to drive around in your Cadillac.

682
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,356
They're not kicking me out.

683
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,317
You don't have the votes.

684
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,993
That's what you think.

685
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,310
- We'll see.
- Yes, we will.

686
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,034
All right, let's eat already.

687
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,112
- Hi, Susan.
- Hi.

688
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,909
Hi. Come in. Come in.

689
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,117
- Have a seat.
- Elaine, I have to ask you a question.

690
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,919
- Oh, sure.
- Are you having an affair with George?

691
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,672
What?

692
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:40,113
Don't be ridiculous.

693
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,350
I mean, why would
anyone wanna sleep...?

694
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,791
Well, obviously...

695
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,831
You know... Of... Of...

696
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,719
Why would you think I was
having an affair with George?

697
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,192
Oh, because he said that he had to
talk with you earlier about some...

698
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,998
...problem that you were having.

699
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,674
Yeah. Yeah, I did have
to talk with him.

700
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,115
I definitely had to talk with him.

701
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,478
I was having a problem
with my boyfriend.

702
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,279
- Art Vandelay?
- Yeah, Art Vandelay.

703
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,829
I'm sorry.
l... I feel like an idiot.

704
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,831
No, no.

705
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,831
That's okay.

706
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,070
- Forget that we ever talked.
- It is so forgotten.

707
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,514
- All right.
- Okay.

708
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,750
Okay. It's no problem.

709
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,515
So was George helpful at all?

710
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,673
Yeah. Oh, yes.
Yes, he was very helpful.

711
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,914
Because Art and I were
getting into this whole thing...

712
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,548
...about his business.

713
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,870
- You know he's an importer-exporter?
- Yeah.

714
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,112
George felt that I was too
adamant in my stand...

715
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,078
...that Art should focus
on the exporting...

716
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,196
...and forget about the importing.

717
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,750
Wait a minute. I thought that Art
wanted to give up the exporting.

718
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,593
- What did I say?
- The importing.

719
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,671
I did?

720
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,437
So, what does he import?

721
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,392
Chips.

722
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,834
- What kind of chips?
- Potato.

723
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,230
- Some corn.
- And what does he export?

724
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,196
Diapers.

725
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:19,511
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- Oh, no, it's okay.

726
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,512
Okay.

727
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,388
Come on, George, pick up.

728
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,676
Oh, pick up. Oh, pick up.

729
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,952
- Hi.
- Hi. So, George...

730
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,588
...what does Art Vandelay import?

731
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:45,476
Matches. Really long matches.

732
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,676
There she is. Okay, if I could have
your attention for a minute here.

733
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,638
We're calling this emergency meeting
of the board of Phase Two...

734
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,156
...to consider a motion of impeachment
of our president, Morty Seinfeld.

735
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,791
- Nervous, Jack?
- What for?

736
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,195
Because I have the votes.

737
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,635
- Nice to see you, Mrs. Choate.
- Hello, Morty.

738
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,788
Building A, are you for or against
the motion to impeach?

739
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,918
- What does that mean?
- It means if you're for the motion...

740
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,479
...you're against Morty.

741
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,073
So why don't you say that?

742
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,151
Hey. I'm running the meeting.

743
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,391
If you think so.

744
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,757
- Building A.
- For impeachment.

745
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,639
- Building B.
- Against impeachment.

746
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,314
- Building C.
- For impeachment.

747
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,948
- Building D.
- Against impeachment.

748
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,839
I can't believe you got that old bag.

749
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,993
Help! Someone help!

750
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,388
Shut up, you old bag.

751
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,996
Thief! Thief!

752
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,749
It's him.

753
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,918
It's your son.

754
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,559
Now I know where I saw him.

755
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,711
He stole my marble rye.

756
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,348
My son never stole anything.
He's a good boy.

757
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,670
They should lock him up.

758
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,077
Like father, like son.

759
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,431
I change my vote.

760
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,113
I vote to impeach.

761
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,840
Me too. I change my vote.

762
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,116
- All those in favour say aye.
- Aye!

763
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,633
All opposed?

764
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,995
The ayes have it.
The motion passes.

765
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,755
Morty Seinfeld, you are officially
dismissed as condo president.

766
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,797
As vice president, Jack Klompus...

767
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,110
...in accordance with
the Phase Two constitution...

768
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,316
...is hereby installed as president.

769
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,232
Hear, hear, Jack.

770
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,595
Good for you, honey.

771
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,271
All right, I know you're in there.

772
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,237
I know you can hear me.

773
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,834
You win, okay? You win.

774
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,355
I can't do it anymore.

775
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,519
What do you want from me,
an apology?

776
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,159
All right.

777
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,753
I'm sorry.

778
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,390
There, I said it.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

779
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:59,633
I see now how we made you feel
when we made you sit home waiting.

780
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,837
I don't know why we do it.
I guess maybe we just kind of enjoy...

781
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,434
...taking advantage of people.

782
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,915
But all that's gonna change.

783
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,558
From now on, no more 9 to 12,
no more 1 to 5.

784
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,870
We'll kind of have appointments.

785
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,076
Eleven o'clock is gonna
mean 11:00...

786
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,756
...and if we can't make it,
I'm gonna call you, tell you why.

787
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,515
For God's sakes, if a doctor can do it,
why can't we?

788
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,832
Anyway...

789
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,072
...that's it.

790
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,309
I'm sorry, bub.

791
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,830
The bags are in the car.
And I guess we'd better go.
