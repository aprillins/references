1
00:00:02,147 --> 00:00:03,205
What are lawyers really?

2
00:00:04,717 --> 00:00:06,082
To me, a lawyer is basically...

3
00:00:06,285 --> 00:00:09,083
...the person that knows
the rules of the country.

4
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:11,519
We're all throwing the dice,
playing the game...

5
00:00:11,724 --> 00:00:14,659
...moving our pieces around the
board, but if there's a problem...

6
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,694
...the lawyer is the only person that
has read the inside top of the box.

7
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:22,957
I think one of the fun things
for them is to say "objection."

8
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:27,538
"Objection! Objection, Your Honor."

9
00:00:28,107 --> 00:00:31,941
"Objection," of course,
is the adult version of "afraid not."

10
00:00:36,615 --> 00:00:39,550
To which the judge
can say two things:

11
00:00:39,718 --> 00:00:44,348
He can say "overruled," which
is the adult version of "afraid so."

12
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,126
Or he can say "sustained,"
which is the adult version of "duh."

13
00:00:55,167 --> 00:00:57,499
So... So you're a lawyer.

14
00:00:58,137 --> 00:00:59,627
What kind of cases
do you handle?

15
00:00:59,805 --> 00:01:03,764
Oh, everything. Divorce, patents,
immigration and naturalization.

16
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:07,579
What is that? lmmigrants come over,
you show them how to act natural?

17
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,744
Are your friends as funny as you?

18
00:01:12,518 --> 00:01:15,578
No, they're not funny at all.
No. I have no funny friends.

19
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:18,780
I'm the funny one. El Clown-o.

20
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,759
Look, I was nice enough
to pick it up for you.

21
00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:24,122
Hey, I've been back four days.
I want my mail.

22
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:26,787
It's mostly bills, magazines
and junk mail anyway.

23
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:28,866
Elaine, that's what mail is.

24
00:01:29,034 --> 00:01:31,867
Without bills, magazines
and junk mail, there is no mail.

25
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:34,802
- Here's my card.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

26
00:01:34,974 --> 00:01:37,340
- Hey, good talking to you.
- Nice meeting you.

27
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:41,913
- Hi.
- Hey, how you doing?

28
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:44,015
You would not believe
what just happened.

29
00:01:44,183 --> 00:01:47,277
I was waiting for you, and this woman
was sitting at the counter.

30
00:01:47,453 --> 00:01:49,011
- What, the one who just left?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:49,188 --> 00:01:50,485
And so we started talking...

32
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:52,590
...and she's this lawyer,
who's incredible.

33
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:54,419
You know,
everything I said was funny.

34
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:57,926
She laughed at everything I said.
She thinks I'm hilarious.

35
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,657
You know, in a way,
it was almost too good.

36
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:04,325
I started so good, I can't go anyplace
but down now, you know.

37
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:06,430
I got no place to go.

38
00:02:07,339 --> 00:02:10,069
Yeah, well, guess it's all over.

39
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:12,634
Hey, is that Babu?

40
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:16,981
- It is. Hey, Babu!
- Jerry.

41
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:18,912
Look at you. You got the job.

42
00:02:19,084 --> 00:02:21,985
- Yes, they give me job, thanks to you.
- Oh, I didn't do anything.

43
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:25,385
No, you do everything. Get me job,
get me place to live in your building.

44
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:26,922
- Come on.
- You very good man.

45
00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:28,559
- Stop.
- You did everything for me.

46
00:02:28,727 --> 00:02:31,025
I can never thank you enough
for everything you do.

47
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,323
You see, this is what I do
with women.

48
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:35,467
I start out too strong.

49
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:38,432
Now I have to become real.
That's when it all falls apart.

50
00:02:39,304 --> 00:02:42,205
What good is real? They don't
want real. They want funny.

51
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:44,968
- No, they don't. No.
- Oh, yes, they do, Elaine.

52
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:48,238
Oh, you gotta put on a show. You
always gotta give them a big show.

53
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:51,281
You always have to be on.
Otherwise, why would they like me?

54
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:54,715
They'd just go for a better-looking
guy with more money.

55
00:02:56,722 --> 00:02:58,189
You mean that's true? I'm right?

56
00:02:58,357 --> 00:03:00,825
Okay, great. Well, I'm glad
everything worked out, Babu.

57
00:03:00,993 --> 00:03:04,019
- Yes. Everything wonderful.
- I'll see you around the building.

58
00:03:04,196 --> 00:03:06,391
I'll see you in the building.

59
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:09,265
- Remember Babu Bhatt?
- Who's he?

60
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:12,330
Remember that guy, opened
the restaurant across the street...

61
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:15,098
...from the building last year
and he wasn't doing so well?

62
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:17,502
I told him he should make it
into all-Pakistani.

63
00:03:17,676 --> 00:03:19,610
- It drove him right out of business.
- Right.

64
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:22,540
So you going with me
to the auto show Saturday?

65
00:03:22,715 --> 00:03:24,945
- Yeah, yeah.
- Can you bring my mail then please?

66
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:27,176
- What mail?
- I picked up his mail...

67
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:30,014
...while he was on the road.
- Why didn't Kramer pick it up?

68
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:32,783
Because he was at that baseball
fantasy camp in Florida.

69
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,586
Oh, yeah, right.
When's he coming back?

70
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:39,561
- Monday, I think.
- Kramer goes to a fantasy camp.

71
00:03:39,732 --> 00:03:42,360
His whole life is a fantasy camp.

72
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:46,561
People should plunk down $2000
to live like him for a week.

73
00:03:46,772 --> 00:03:49,297
Do nothing,
fall ass backwards in the money...

74
00:03:49,475 --> 00:03:52,239
...mooch food off your neighbors
and have sex without dating.

75
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:54,038
That's a fantasy camp.

76
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:58,273
Listen, if you're gonna go out
with this lawyer, have dinner with us...

77
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:01,248
...then maybe you can go
to the auto show with her if you want.

78
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,854
Have a little company.
Take the pressure off.

79
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:09,126
He never heard of corduroy!

80
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:11,421
Stop it, you're killing me!

81
00:04:12,297 --> 00:04:18,202
Never heard of corduroy.
True story. True story.

82
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:20,737
Funny.

83
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:27,539
- No. No, I don't... I don't think so.
- Why?

84
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:30,705
Well, I think I'm better off
going one-on-one.

85
00:04:30,983 --> 00:04:34,384
I don't know why you wanna play
man-to-man when you could play zone.

86
00:04:36,054 --> 00:04:37,385
She might not be comfortable.

87
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:39,751
Why? We're all very nice.
We're very friendly.

88
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:41,916
- We'll be funny.
- No. No.

89
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:44,221
It's not good. I don't think so.

90
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,296
All right. If you change your mind,
we'll wind up at Isabella's around 7.

91
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:50,799
No. No Isabella's.
I don't want to go to Isabella's.

92
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:53,904
- Why?
- No, it's too trendy. No Isabella's.

93
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:01,936
Excellent.

94
00:05:02,447 --> 00:05:04,813
Like I really know
what I'm talking about.

95
00:05:07,085 --> 00:05:09,576
Toasting makes me uncomfortable.

96
00:05:09,755 --> 00:05:11,416
But toast I love.

97
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,657
Never start the day
without a good piece of toast.

98
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,229
In fact, let's toast to toast.

99
00:05:24,436 --> 00:05:27,371
Look who's here. Georgie boy.

100
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:30,842
What are you doing here? I thought
you said you hated Isabella's.

101
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:32,374
No, I talked him into it.

102
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:34,034
What happened to the auto show?

103
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:37,376
Oh, we're still going. Still going.
Elaine, do the spokesmodel.

104
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,943
The turbo quadramatic transmission...

105
00:05:40,118 --> 00:05:42,450
...offers you the power and prestige
to propel you...

106
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:44,612
...well into the 21 st century.

107
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,924
Hi.

108
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:56,128
- Hi.
- Cheryl, this is Elaine and Jerry.

109
00:05:56,301 --> 00:05:57,563
Hi. Nice to meet you.

110
00:05:57,736 --> 00:06:00,864
- Would you like to join us?
- No, no. They don't wanna join us.

111
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,802
- No, it's okay. Don't be silly.
- Okay.

112
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:04,670
Why don't we put
these tables together.

113
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:08,677
You can't do that. They're round.
It makes an eight, and it just...

114
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,810
Jerry. Jerry, tell them that
funny story you were telling me...

115
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:16,955
No. No.

116
00:06:17,122 --> 00:06:21,149
No, George, it's so funny. We saw
this cab driver's picture, right?

117
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:22,918
You know, we should really order.

118
00:06:23,095 --> 00:06:26,292
The service is so slow here.
By the time you get anything...

119
00:06:26,698 --> 00:06:29,531
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you
a legal question?

120
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:31,903
- I'm being sued.
- Oh, what happened?

121
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:37,535
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin,
and I crossed against the light...

122
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:41,212
...and I knocked over
the delivery boy.

123
00:06:42,214 --> 00:06:44,648
Was he Chinese?

124
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,176
Yeah.

125
00:06:46,351 --> 00:06:48,945
Is your...? Is your last name "Benes"?

126
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:53,455
- How did you know?
- Oh, God! Ping is my cousin.

127
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,149
No.

128
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,985
- That's so funny.
- I'm handling his case.

129
00:06:58,163 --> 00:06:59,152
What?

130
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:01,390
- You're Cheryl Fong?
- That's right.

131
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:02,828
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

132
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:05,993
I can't believe it.
This is such a coincidence.

133
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:07,331
I know.

134
00:07:07,906 --> 00:07:09,271
Wow. Well, l...

135
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:12,842
I guess you don't have any advice
for me on how to win the case.

136
00:07:17,549 --> 00:07:19,540
Will you excuse me?
I have to make a call.

137
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:22,313
Tell Ping I said hello.

138
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:26,921
Tell him you think you may have
broken the case wide open.

139
00:07:31,763 --> 00:07:33,560
I can't believe it.

140
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:35,723
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

141
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:38,335
- What?
- This is not good. This is not good.

142
00:07:38,503 --> 00:07:40,971
- What's the matter?
- I don't think it's a great idea...

143
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:42,766
...for you to sit here.
- Why not?

144
00:07:42,941 --> 00:07:45,501
He thinks if you're too funny,
he might not look so funny.

145
00:07:45,677 --> 00:07:46,939
Biff.

146
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:48,907
What?

147
00:07:49,081 --> 00:07:52,175
- You're not worried about that?
- No, of course not.

148
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:54,581
I mean, so what if I'm funny.
Who cares?

149
00:07:54,753 --> 00:07:57,745
He thinks that if a woman
sees a guy put on a better show...

150
00:07:57,923 --> 00:08:01,381
...she'll walk out on his show,
go see the other show.

151
00:08:02,094 --> 00:08:03,220
Well, should we leave?

152
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:05,863
Well, maybe you don't have
to be so funny.

153
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:08,226
Would it kill you
not to be so funny all the time?

154
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,526
That's all I'm asking.

155
00:08:09,701 --> 00:08:11,168
This woman thinks I'm very funny.

156
00:08:11,336 --> 00:08:13,463
Now you're gonna be funny,
so, what am I gonna be?

157
00:08:13,638 --> 00:08:17,768
I'll be a short, bald guy with glasses
who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.

158
00:08:19,011 --> 00:08:22,947
This is so ridiculous.
Can we just go over there?

159
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:25,777
Look, I don't have to be funny.
I don't care.

160
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:27,111
- You don't?
- No way.

161
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:28,946
It's completely under my control.

162
00:08:29,421 --> 00:08:32,788
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.

163
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,755
Of course I can.
Am I being funny now?

164
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:37,226
A little.

165
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:39,489
Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?

166
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:41,093
Yeah.

167
00:08:41,266 --> 00:08:42,631
George, is this funny?

168
00:08:43,068 --> 00:08:44,592
It's funny.

169
00:08:46,538 --> 00:08:48,802
And it wouldn't kill you to not
be so funny either.

170
00:08:48,974 --> 00:08:50,464
What? What did I do?

171
00:08:50,642 --> 00:08:52,007
- Hi.
- Hi.

172
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:54,943
Hello.

173
00:08:58,216 --> 00:08:59,808
Welcome back.

174
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,681
I'm sorry. It was my aunt's birthday.

175
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:05,413
She makes such a big deal about it.

176
00:09:05,757 --> 00:09:07,987
Well, nobody likes to get old, right?

177
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,062
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic
of how another year has gone by...

178
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:15,062
...and how little we've grown.

179
00:09:16,034 --> 00:09:18,025
No matter how desperate we are
that someday...

180
00:09:18,203 --> 00:09:21,400
...a better self will emerge, each flicker
of the candles on the cake...

181
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:22,938
...we know it's not to be.

182
00:09:23,842 --> 00:09:27,505
But for the rest of our sad,
wretched, pathetic lives...

183
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:30,972
...this is who we are to the bitter end...

184
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:33,913
...inevitably, irrevocably.

185
00:09:35,053 --> 00:09:38,420
Happy birthday? No such thing.

186
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:43,320
Funny guy, huh?

187
00:09:47,532 --> 00:09:49,466
Here, take it.
I was glad to get rid of it.

188
00:09:49,634 --> 00:09:52,159
Well, thank you very much.
It's about time.

189
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:54,700
Oh, listen. So guess what.

190
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:58,806
Cheryl convinced Ping
to drop the case against me.

191
00:09:58,977 --> 00:10:00,569
Drop the case?

192
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:03,043
Wow, congratulations.
That will save you some money.

193
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:06,013
Yeah. No kidding. That lawyer
was gonna charge me a fortune.

194
00:10:06,284 --> 00:10:10,516
Oh, great. Birth announcement
from Arnie and Joy Harris.

195
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:15,688
Hear that? Guess who's back.

196
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,296
Thought you weren't
coming back till Monday.

197
00:10:25,036 --> 00:10:27,903
Well, the camp ended
a few days early.

198
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,005
Why?

199
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:32,700
Well, there was an incident.

200
00:10:34,012 --> 00:10:35,240
What happened?

201
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:38,541
I punched Mickey Mantle
in the mouth.

202
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:40,751
- What?
- Yeah, I punched him...

203
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,614
...and they took him
to the hospital...

204
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:44,948
...and then they canceled
the rest of the week.

205
00:10:45,123 --> 00:10:46,715
You punched who in the mouth?

206
00:10:46,892 --> 00:10:48,450
Mickey Mantle.

207
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:50,552
What happened?

208
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:52,560
Well, you know,
we were playing a game...

209
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:55,598
...and I was pitching.
I was really throwing some smoke.

210
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:57,927
And Joe Pepitone, he was up...

211
00:10:58,103 --> 00:11:00,663
...and, man, that guy,
he was crowding the plate.

212
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,170
Wow, Joe Pepitone.

213
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,138
Well, Joe Pepitone or not,
I own the inside of that plate.

214
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,302
So, you know,
I throw one inside, you know.

215
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,347
A little chin music
right on his pants...

216
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:14,417
...because I gotta intimidate,
you know, when I'm on the mound.

217
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:17,578
Well, the next pitch,
he's right back in the same place.

218
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:20,520
So I had to plunk him.

219
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,150
- You plunked him?
- Oh, yeah.

220
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:26,855
Well, he throws down his bat,
he comes racing up to the mound.

221
00:11:27,032 --> 00:11:29,262
Next thing,
both benches are cleared, you know.

222
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:32,232
A brouhaha breaks out between
the guys in the camp, you know...

223
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:33,735
...and the old Yankee players.

224
00:11:33,905 --> 00:11:36,806
As I'm trying to get Moose Skowron
off of one of my teammates...

225
00:11:36,975 --> 00:11:38,704
...somebody pulls me from behind...

226
00:11:38,877 --> 00:11:41,641
...and I turned around
and I popped him.

227
00:11:41,813 --> 00:11:44,805
I looked down and whoa, man!
It's Mickey.

228
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:47,980
I punched his lights out.

229
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:49,885
Wow, this is incredible.

230
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:53,281
Leave me alone!
You can't do this to me.

231
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:54,651
What's going on out there?

232
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:55,850
What are you doing?

233
00:11:56,027 --> 00:11:59,929
This is not right, people. You're
making a very bad mistake. Very bad.

234
00:12:00,098 --> 00:12:02,293
Babu. I'll be right back.

235
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:04,526
- Yeah, so...
- Hank Bauer, he's screaming:

236
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:08,036
"Mickey! What have you done
with Mickey! You killed Mickey!"

237
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:12,769
- So, what did you do?
- Well, I got the hell out of there.

238
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:15,311
They took Babu away.

239
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,038
They took Babu away?

240
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:19,877
Yeah, the immigration guy
said his visa was expired.

241
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:22,417
Poor Babu. Everything was going
so well for him.

242
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:24,282
He had an apartment, he had a job.

243
00:12:24,456 --> 00:12:26,947
- What a shame.
- Jerry!

244
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:30,223
Help me!

245
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:35,924
I will, Babu!
I will help you, Babu! Don't worry!

246
00:12:36,468 --> 00:12:38,834
Then Hank Bauer, you know,
he's chasing me around.

247
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:41,996
He trips over third base
and knocks over Clete Boyer.

248
00:12:42,974 --> 00:12:44,305
What?

249
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:47,573
- Well, this is interesting.
- What is it?

250
00:12:47,746 --> 00:12:50,044
It's a letter
from the lmmigration Bureau.

251
00:12:50,215 --> 00:12:54,151
It's Babu's
visa-renewal application form.

252
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:57,714
They must have put it
in my mailbox by mistake.

253
00:12:58,056 --> 00:13:00,524
Well, doesn't he need that?

254
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:12,998
If you'd given me my mail last week,
this never would have happened.

255
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:15,537
Well, you should have come
to my house to pick it up.

256
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:18,005
- So am I being funny now?
- No, actually, you're not.

257
00:13:18,176 --> 00:13:20,770
See, I told you I wasn't funny
all the time.

258
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:23,374
Hey, George, look,
I'm not funny now.

259
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:27,483
No, and you weren't funny last night.
You got us both so depressed...

260
00:13:27,652 --> 00:13:29,779
...she asked me to drive
her home after dinner.

261
00:13:29,954 --> 00:13:31,512
I need to get in touch with Cheryl.

262
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,419
Babu needs a lawyer.
His visa's expired.

263
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:34,922
There's a million lawyers.

264
00:13:35,093 --> 00:13:38,119
Yeah, but you said this is one
of the things that her firm does.

265
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:41,231
All right, but no funny business.
Same deal as last night.

266
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,425
- Will you stop it already.
- Jerry, please.

267
00:13:44,602 --> 00:13:46,001
How long is this gonna go on?

268
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:48,202
Till I'm comfortable.

269
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,364
Well, when is that gonna be?

270
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:52,407
After consummation.

271
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:57,481
Consummation? I don't think
you have enough material.

272
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,547
I have a friend in the immigration
department who owes me a big favor.

273
00:14:05,724 --> 00:14:07,282
You're very lucky.

274
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:14,590
That's wonderful news. Thank you.

275
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:18,229
You're a very serious person,
aren't you?

276
00:14:20,138 --> 00:14:24,165
Well, with so many people
in the world deprived and unhappy...

277
00:14:24,342 --> 00:14:28,142
...it doesn't seem like it would
be fair to be cheerful.

278
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,546
I understand.

279
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:38,583
I think that's curdled.

280
00:14:38,757 --> 00:14:40,691
I don't care.

281
00:14:43,661 --> 00:14:45,891
Do you ever laugh?

282
00:14:46,264 --> 00:14:50,325
Not really.
Sometimes when I'm in the tub.

283
00:14:52,137 --> 00:14:54,469
That's so sad.

284
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,731
What do you do?

285
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,374
I'm a comedian.

286
00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:01,240
Oh, let me get that.

287
00:15:01,746 --> 00:15:03,543
You've been so helpful.

288
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:09,486
Hey, we're gonna go
see Babu now, right?

289
00:15:09,654 --> 00:15:11,622
Yeah, I'll just pay for this.

290
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,883
I'm just gonna say hi to Cheryl.

291
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:15,457
- Hi.
- Hi.

292
00:15:15,627 --> 00:15:18,095
Listen, gosh,
I wanted to thank you so much...

293
00:15:18,263 --> 00:15:20,424
...for convincing Ping
to drop the case.

294
00:15:20,598 --> 00:15:24,034
After we met, you were all so nice,
I just couldn't go through with it.

295
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:26,966
But between you and me, you would
have paid through the nose.

296
00:15:29,674 --> 00:15:32,370
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.

297
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:44,215
- Babu.
- Jerry! Jerry. Hello, Jerry,

298
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:47,381
- You remember Elaine.
- Yes, yes, of course.

299
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:50,527
- Nice to meet you.
- So nice of you both to come.

300
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:54,461
- Oh, Babu.
- No, you're both very kind. Very kind.

301
00:15:54,632 --> 00:15:57,260
- Oh, well, you know, we try.
- We do what we can.

302
00:15:57,435 --> 00:15:59,630
- We do what we can.
- See...

303
00:15:59,804 --> 00:16:02,637
...the problem is, I never got my
visa-renewal form in the mail.

304
00:16:02,807 --> 00:16:07,369
- I was expecting it.
- Yes. See, here's the thing, Babu.

305
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:08,944
What happened was...

306
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:11,775
...I was away for a couple of weeks
doing some comedy shows.

307
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:14,009
The comedy shows,
you're very funny man.

308
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:18,414
Well, Elaine, here, was picking up
my mail while I was away...

309
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,683
...because that little box
can get very full.

310
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:23,123
Yes, of course.
TV Guide, magazines, everything.

311
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:24,828
I would have picked up your mail.

312
00:16:24,996 --> 00:16:27,692
- Your box is right next to mine.
- I don't want to bother you.

313
00:16:27,866 --> 00:16:31,358
No bother. You get me job. You get
me apartment, you very good man.

314
00:16:31,536 --> 00:16:34,130
Well, yesterday,
after they took you away...

315
00:16:34,305 --> 00:16:36,830
...I looked in my mail,
and I noticed that the mailman...

316
00:16:37,008 --> 00:16:40,409
...accidentally put your
visa-renewal in my mailbox.

317
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:41,704
Come again?

318
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,347
See, I've been home for a week...

319
00:16:43,515 --> 00:16:45,915
...and Elaine didn't give me my mail
till yesterday...

320
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:48,848
...even though
I asked her repeatedly for it.

321
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,751
Yeah, but, Babu, he could have come
to my house to pick it up.

322
00:16:52,924 --> 00:16:54,551
You had my visa application?

323
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:56,284
- Well, not technically.
- I kill you!

324
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:58,356
- What about her?
- I kill both of you!

325
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,724
- Babu.
- No Babu.

326
00:16:59,898 --> 00:17:02,366
No Babu. You're bad man.
You're very bad man.

327
00:17:02,534 --> 00:17:03,865
You're very lazy, bad man.

328
00:17:04,035 --> 00:17:05,662
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything.

329
00:17:05,837 --> 00:17:08,670
I have a lawyer who knows someone
in the immigration department.

330
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,775
They'll straighten the whole thing out.
The wheels are in motion.

331
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:13,376
Things are happening
as we speak.

332
00:17:13,545 --> 00:17:15,911
- The wheels are in motion?
- The wheels are in motion.

333
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,274
Things are happening.

334
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:22,414
Jerry?

335
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:23,918
I'm very attracted to him.

336
00:17:24,188 --> 00:17:26,884
You think the person
you were talking to was him?

337
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:31,552
That's not even close to him.
He's funny. Jerry's funny.

338
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:34,823
- He's never said anything funny.
- He can't not be funny.

339
00:17:34,999 --> 00:17:40,062
No, no. He's dark and disturbed.

340
00:17:40,238 --> 00:17:42,900
Dark and disturbed?

341
00:17:43,074 --> 00:17:46,066
His whole life revolves around
Superman and cereal.

342
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:48,406
What kind of a friend are you?

343
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:52,277
I convinced him to act like that so
that you would think I was funnier.

344
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,475
That's how disturbed I am.

345
00:17:54,652 --> 00:17:56,779
You want disturbed?
That's disturbed.

346
00:17:56,955 --> 00:17:59,480
I mean, you can't find sickness
like that anywhere.

347
00:17:59,657 --> 00:18:01,852
You think sickness like that
grows on trees?

348
00:18:02,026 --> 00:18:04,187
Nobody is sicker than me. Nobody.

349
00:18:04,362 --> 00:18:06,523
He's pretending.
I am the genuine article.

350
00:18:06,698 --> 00:18:09,292
You're telling me Jerry's whole thing
was an act?

351
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:12,834
And I put him up to it,
because I'm sick.

352
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:15,268
I'm the one that needs help.

353
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:18,435
I gotta go.

354
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,174
Well, should I call you later?

355
00:18:21,346 --> 00:18:22,438
Please don't.

356
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:26,209
But... But I'm disturbed.
I'm depressed.

357
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:30,320
I'm inadequate. I got it all!

358
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,423
So, what's up with Babu?
How come he's not back?

359
00:18:36,594 --> 00:18:38,494
I don't know. I don't understand it.

360
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:42,155
Cheryl was supposed to take care
of it. He should be back by now.

361
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:44,768
- Yeah?
- George.

362
00:18:44,936 --> 00:18:46,961
- Come on up.
- Babu.

363
00:18:47,438 --> 00:18:50,669
- Babu, what happened to you?
- Babu must be back.

364
00:18:50,842 --> 00:18:53,037
- Well, where's Babu?
- He is in Pakistan!

365
00:18:53,211 --> 00:18:55,270
- Who are you?
- I am his brother.

366
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:57,880
He knew a lawyer.
It was all going to be fixed.

367
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:00,040
I'm sure the lawyer
did everything they could.

368
00:19:00,218 --> 00:19:02,982
Then where is Babu?
What happened to Babu?

369
00:19:03,154 --> 00:19:05,179
Show me Babu!

370
00:19:07,091 --> 00:19:08,956
- Snapple?
- No.

371
00:19:10,928 --> 00:19:12,657
Too fruity.

372
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:18,365
Hey, what happened?

373
00:19:18,536 --> 00:19:20,731
I thought Cheryl
was gonna help Babu get his visa.

374
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:22,770
- She didn't help him?
- No.

375
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,238
- Where is he?
- He's in Pakistan.

376
00:19:26,144 --> 00:19:27,168
Oh, boy

377
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:29,204
What do you mean, "Oh, boy"?

378
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,840
Well, last night she told me
that she liked you.

379
00:19:34,018 --> 00:19:36,179
Not you, the disturbed you.

380
00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:38,717
So I had to tell her the truth.

381
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,188
You told her the truth?
Well, you got Babu deported!

382
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,453
What do you mean I "got"? You didn't
give him his visa application.

383
00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:45,994
That's because she had my mail.

384
00:19:46,164 --> 00:19:49,600
Well, I wouldn't have to get your mail
if he didn't go to that fantasy camp.

385
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:52,531
Well, I just came back
from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.

386
00:19:52,704 --> 00:19:54,399
How could you go in there?

387
00:19:54,572 --> 00:19:57,302
Well, I had to. I had to apologize.

388
00:19:57,508 --> 00:19:59,908
I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle,
my idol.

389
00:20:00,078 --> 00:20:02,103
It was eating me up inside!

390
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,806
Well, what happened?

391
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:06,745
I got down on my knees, and I went,
"Go ahead, Mickey, hit me.

392
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:09,910
I'm begging you, Mickey.
Please, hit me. Come on, hit me.

393
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:12,249
I love you, Mickey. I love you."

394
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:13,720
So, what did he do?

395
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:16,758
Well, the four of them, they picked
me up by my pants...

396
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:19,761
...and they threw me outside,
right into a horse.

397
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,794
- Kramer.
- Hey!

398
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:26,266
Yeah. It's my Chinese food.

399
00:20:26,437 --> 00:20:28,496
Oh, Ping. Hi.

400
00:20:28,673 --> 00:20:32,040
Listen, thank you so much
for dropping that lawsuit against me.

401
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,235
- Not anymore.
- What?

402
00:20:34,412 --> 00:20:37,279
Cheryl call me last night.
Lawsuit back on.

403
00:20:37,448 --> 00:20:38,779
Why?

404
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,282
She call you
and your friends big liars.

405
00:20:41,452 --> 00:20:43,317
You think she nice girl?

406
00:20:43,488 --> 00:20:46,855
Wait till you see her in court.
She's a shark!

407
00:20:47,024 --> 00:20:49,424
They call her "The Terminator."

408
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:54,122
She never lose a case,
and now you make her mad.

409
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:56,493
She doubled the damages.

410
00:20:56,667 --> 00:21:00,000
Hasta la vista, baby.

411
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,275
So his friend had the mail,
but she did not give it to him.

412
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:10,946
And then he came to visit me...

413
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:14,915
...said a lawyer would call and help.
He said the wheels were in motion.

414
00:21:15,086 --> 00:21:18,419
But there was no motion.
There was nothing.

415
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:20,784
And so they sent me back here.

416
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:23,389
This is a terrible story, Babu.

417
00:21:24,028 --> 00:21:25,495
What are you going to do?

418
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:28,461
I'm going to save up every rupee...

419
00:21:28,633 --> 00:21:30,123
...for someday...

420
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:33,737
...I will get back to America,
and when I do...

421
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:36,635
...I will exact vengeance
on this man.

422
00:21:36,874 --> 00:21:38,569
I cannot forget him.

423
00:21:38,743 --> 00:21:40,608
He haunts me.

424
00:21:40,912 --> 00:21:47,408
He's a very bad man.
He's a very, very bad man.

425
00:21:47,852 --> 00:21:49,285
I am for open immigration...

426
00:21:49,453 --> 00:21:51,819
...but that sign we have
on the Statue of Liberty:

427
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:55,186
"Give us your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses."

428
00:21:55,359 --> 00:21:58,851
Can't we just say, "Hey, the door's
open, we'll take whoever you got."

429
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:02,761
Do we have to specify
the "wretched refuse"?

430
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:04,265
I mean, why don't we just say:

431
00:22:04,435 --> 00:22:06,926
"Give us the unhappy, the sad,
the slow, the ugly...

432
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:09,834
...people that can't drive,
that they have trouble merging...

433
00:22:10,007 --> 00:22:13,465
...if they can't stay in their lane,
don't signal, can't parallel park...

434
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:16,670
...if they're sneezing, if they're
stuffed up, if they're clogged...

435
00:22:16,848 --> 00:22:20,409
...if they have bad penmanship, don't
return calls, if they have dandruff...

436
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:25,113
...food between their teeth, if they have
bad credit, if they have no credit...

437
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:27,450
...missed a spot shaving."
In other words...

438
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:31,288
...any dysfunctional, defective slob...

439
00:22:31,462 --> 00:22:33,930
...that you can somehow cattle prod
onto a wagon...

440
00:22:34,098 --> 00:22:36,692
...send them over, we want them.
