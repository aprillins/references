1
00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:03,397
As a kid, my favorite ride...

2
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:07,326
...was the bumper car. Remember?
Going around in a circle.

3
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:09,534
There was always one kid
that could not do it.

4
00:00:09,703 --> 00:00:10,913
Do you remember this kid?

5
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:12,934
As soon as the ride gets started...

6
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:15,397
...he'd be, like, stuck
in a pack of empty cars.

7
00:00:16,038 --> 00:00:17,249
Just--

8
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:21,116
''Excuse me.

9
00:00:21,414 --> 00:00:23,422
Excuse me. It won't go!

10
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:25,088
Come on!

11
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:27,617
It's almost over!''

12
00:00:29,062 --> 00:00:30,721
He always ends up
with the attendant...

13
00:00:30,886 --> 00:00:33,438
...hanging off that big pole
helping him steer it.

14
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,437
''Stop crying.''

15
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:40,290
Then there's always
that other--

16
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:41,860
One other really bad car--

17
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:43,450
The helpless father-and-son team.

18
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:45,476
This is another car just
not going anywhere.

19
00:00:45,638 --> 00:00:47,743
They're never organized.
Who's on the wheel?

20
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,339
Who's pressing on the gas? Just:

21
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:51,419
''Son, turn the wheel.''

22
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:58,274
All right, Coney Island?

23
00:00:58,437 --> 00:01:01,055
Okay, you can take the B or the F
and switch for the N...

24
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:02,464
...at Broadway and Lafayette.

25
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,538
Or you can go over the bridge
to DeKalb...

26
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,367
...and catch the Q
to Atlantic Avenue...

27
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,402
...then switch to the IRT,
2, 3, 4 or 5.

28
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:10,783
But don't get on the G.

29
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:12,989
That's very tempting,
but you wind up on Smith...

30
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,360
...and 9th Street.
Then you gotta get on the R.

31
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:18,783
Couldn't he just take the D
straight to Coney Island?

32
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,441
Well, yeah.

33
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,602
Okay. What time is your
job interview, George?

34
00:01:25,763 --> 00:01:26,941
<i>9</i>:45.

35
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:28,384
Don't whistle on the elevator.

36
00:01:28,836 --> 00:01:31,225
-Why not?
-That's what Willy Loman told Biff...

37
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:33,534
...before his interview
in <i>Death of a Salesman</i>.

38
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:35,903
You're comparing me to Biff Loman?
Very encouraging.

39
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:38,718
The biggest loser in the history
of American literature.

40
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:41,152
-I gotta get going.
-What time's the lesbian wedding?

41
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:43,614
-<i>9</i>:30.
-Lesbian wedding.

42
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:46,594
How do they work the bride and groom
on that? Do they flip a coin?

43
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:48,730
Yeah, they flip a coin.

44
00:01:49,314 --> 00:01:52,216
What, was that not politically correct?
It's a legitimate question.

45
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:55,838
I'm so tired. I'm gonna fall asleep
on that train.

46
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:58,424
I feel when lesbians are looking at me,
they're thinking:

47
00:01:58,595 --> 00:02:00,383
''That's why I'm not a heterosexual.''

48
00:02:02,466 --> 00:02:05,248
All right, Jerry, come on.
Pick up the check so we can go.

49
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,904
-I'm paying for breakfast?
-Yeah.

50
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:09,562
-Yeah.
-Why do I always pay?

51
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,584
What am l, made of money?

52
00:02:11,874 --> 00:02:13,303
You bunch of deadbeats.

53
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:16,606
How many tickets you paying today?

54
00:02:17,122 --> 00:02:21,148
Let's see. Speeding, running a
red light, no license, no registration...

55
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:24,825
...no plates, no brake lights,
no rear-view mirror.

56
00:02:25,377 --> 00:02:27,035
Look at that one.

57
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:29,625
-''No doors''?
-Yeah, I'm fighting that one.

58
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,700
You know, this is gonna cost me
over 600 bucks.

59
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:37,469
I can't carry change in these pants.
It falls out.

60
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:41,019
-Here you go.
-There you go.

61
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:42,492
Thank you.

62
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:46,780
That guy's not blind.

63
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,488
So can I convince anybody
to come down to Coney Island?

64
00:02:50,656 --> 00:02:52,892
Gotta pick up my car
at the pound. George?

65
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,878
I can't believe they found
your stolen car.

66
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,349
Not only did they find it...

67
00:02:56,512 --> 00:02:58,900
...it was simonized,
and the front end was aligned.

68
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:01,465
-That's amazing.
-So, what do you say?

69
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:03,966
Ride on the Cyclone.
Hot dog at Nathan's on me.

70
00:03:04,127 --> 00:03:06,363
Who are you, Satan?
I'm close to a job here.

71
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:08,764
-It's my second interview.
-All right, Biff.

72
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:12,949
Elaine? Merry-go-round?

73
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:15,158
I can't. I'm the best man.

74
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,624
Kramer. Bumper cars.

75
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,758
I gotta go to court. I'll get in trouble.
What's the matter with you?

76
00:03:20,927 --> 00:03:23,032
It could be years till I get
back to Coney Island.

77
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:24,475
I can't go on the rides alone.

78
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,388
<i>42nd Street. Change for the D</i>
<i>and the double R...

79
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:29,852
<i>...the 2, 3, 4, 5, 7,</i>
<i>the C, K and F train.

80
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,728
Well....

81
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:49,175
See you.

82
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,389
Hey!

83
00:04:44,475 --> 00:04:45,653
Yeah!

84
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:38,804
-You looking for a job?
-Me? Why?

85
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:41,135
Well, you're reading
the classifieds.

86
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:43,378
Oh, no. No, no.

87
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:46,414
I was just looking for the stock page.
Here it is.

88
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:48,374
Looking for the quotes.

89
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:49,943
Gotta check the quotes.

90
00:05:50,104 --> 00:05:51,860
Love a good quote.

91
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:54,228
IBM up a quarter.

92
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:55,861
What do you know?

93
00:05:56,568 --> 00:05:59,088
You didn't look like someone
who needed a job.

94
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,320
Me? No, I don't.

95
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:06,641
Doing very well. Very well, yeah.

96
00:06:07,096 --> 00:06:08,306
So you're in the market?

97
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:11,636
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm in the market.

98
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,977
Which market?

99
00:06:13,847 --> 00:06:16,400
Which market? The.... The big one.

100
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:18,902
The big market with the big board.

101
00:06:19,063 --> 00:06:22,511
Bull market, bear market.
You name the market, I'm there.

102
00:06:23,735 --> 00:06:25,939
So do you work for one of
the big brokerage houses?

103
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:27,379
They wish.

104
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:28,917
I hate the big brokerage houses.

105
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,508
Hate them with a passion.

106
00:06:30,678 --> 00:06:32,369
Big brokerage houses
killed my father.

107
00:06:32,823 --> 00:06:35,059
-Really?
-Well, they hurt him bad.

108
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:37,197
Really hurt his feelings.

109
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:40,400
It's a long story.
I don't like to talk about it...

110
00:06:41,078 --> 00:06:43,663
...but I swore I would never work
for a big brokerage house.

111
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,732
See, all they care about is money.

112
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:49,708
I'm about more than money.
I'm about...

113
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:51,055
...people.

114
00:06:51,318 --> 00:06:53,325
So I've always gone my own way...

115
00:06:53,942 --> 00:06:55,633
...and I've never looked back.

116
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:19,249
I started riding these trains
in the '40s.

117
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:23,469
Those days, a man would give up
his seat for a woman.

118
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,213
Now we're liberated.
We have to stand.

119
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:28,685
It's ironic.

120
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,158
What's ironic?

121
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:33,332
This. That we've come all this way,
we made all this progress...

122
00:07:33,492 --> 00:07:36,394
...but, you know, we lost
the little things, the niceties.

123
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,376
No, I mean,
what does ''ironic'' mean?

124
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,558
Where you off to
with such a nice present?

125
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:46,764
-Birthday party?
-A wedding.

126
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:48,655
-A wedding?
-Yeah.

127
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,630
I didn't think people
still get married.

128
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:54,895
It's hard today
with the men and women.

129
00:07:55,251 --> 00:07:56,428
You're telling me.

130
00:07:56,723 --> 00:08:00,105
-So they're a nice couple?
-Oh, very nice.

131
00:08:00,339 --> 00:08:02,608
What does he do,
if you don't mind my asking?

132
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:04,331
-She.
-She?

133
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:08,240
She. She works, he doesn't.
He sounds like my son.

134
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:10,317
There is no ''he.''

135
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:12,206
There's no he?

136
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:14,411
So who's getting married?

137
00:08:15,859 --> 00:08:17,200
Two women.

138
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:18,889
It's...

139
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:20,399
...a lesbian wedding.

140
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:24,331
Lesbian wedding?

141
00:08:25,202 --> 00:08:28,104
Yep. Yep, I'm...

142
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,252
...the best man.

143
00:08:32,562 --> 00:08:33,936
Great.

144
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:39,530
My luck. I don't talk to a soul
on the subway for 35 years...

145
00:08:39,697 --> 00:08:42,283
...I get the best man
at a lesbian wedding.

146
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:44,107
No, no. You don't understand.

147
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,800
I'm not a lesbian!

148
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:49,003
I hate men, but I'm not a lesbian.

149
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:35,397
<i>I'm really looking forward to this.

150
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:38,316
<i>I love weddings.</i>
<i>Maybe I'll meet somebody.

151
00:09:39,407 --> 00:09:40,683
<i>Maybe not.

152
00:09:43,598 --> 00:09:46,533
<i>Oh, man. We're stopping?

153
00:09:48,174 --> 00:09:50,956
Well, this is where I get off.

154
00:09:51,118 --> 00:09:53,769
-You do?
-Yeah.

155
00:09:53,934 --> 00:09:56,901
Hey, why don't you...? Oh, nothing.

156
00:09:57,261 --> 00:09:58,472
No, no. What?

157
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:00,939
Well, I was gonna say,
''Why don't you get off with me.''

158
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,011
But you're obviously very busy
on your way...

159
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:05,091
...to some important meeting
or something.

160
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,206
Yeah. Well....

161
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,740
See, I knew it was a bad idea.

162
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:17,512
Hey, what's another million,
give or take? I get off...

163
00:10:17,677 --> 00:10:19,564
...when and where I wanna get off.

164
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:23,915
I'm stuck. Could you just pull it
a little--?

165
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:25,321
This'll just be a second.

166
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,467
Don't-- Don't start the train!

167
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:28,806
Don't start the train!

168
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:31,781
Here it is. Here it is,
the four horse in the first race.

169
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:34,021
-Pappernick.
-How do you know he's gonna win?

170
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:35,715
My UPS guy. Lance.

171
00:10:35,884 --> 00:10:38,121
The guys who own the horse
are his regular customers.

172
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:39,943
Every horse he's ever given me
has won.

173
00:10:40,108 --> 00:10:41,863
-Yeah?
-Yeah. They've been sandbagging...

174
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:44,449
...looking for a good spot.
He's been getting in light...

175
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,718
...because they're using a bug boy.
The workouts have been unpublished.

176
00:10:47,884 --> 00:10:50,186
They're ready to run with him.
Gonna break his maiden.

177
00:10:50,348 --> 00:10:52,682
He's gonna go for a great price,
maybe 30-1 .

178
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:55,265
-I'm telling you, it's a lock.
-But it rained last night.

179
00:10:55,435 --> 00:10:57,857
Exactly. This horse loves the slop.

180
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:00,362
It's in his bloodlines.
His father was a mudder.

181
00:11:00,523 --> 00:11:02,694
-His mother was a mudder.
-His mother was a mudder?

182
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:05,641
What did I say? Let's go to the office.
I'm gonna call my bookie.

183
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:07,265
Hey, don't tell anybody.

184
00:11:11,467 --> 00:11:12,896
Oh, man.

185
00:11:31,306 --> 00:11:33,029
Okay.

186
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:46,663
You realize, of course, you're naked.

187
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:50,336
Naked, dressed,
I don't see any difference.

188
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:52,321
You ought to sit here.

189
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:53,896
There's a difference.

190
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:56,966
You got something
against the naked body?

191
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:59,427
I got something against yours.

192
00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:02,406
How about a couple of deep knee
bends, maybe some squat-thrusts?

193
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:04,543
Who's got time for squat-thrusts?

194
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:07,079
All right, how about
skipping breakfast?

195
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,022
I'm guessing you're not a
''half-grapefruit and black coffee'' man.

196
00:12:10,185 --> 00:12:11,428
I like a good breakfast.

197
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:14,276
I understand.
I like a good breakfast...

198
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,669
...long as you don't wind up trapped
in a room in overalls and pigtails...

199
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:19,588
...being counseled by Dick Gregory.

200
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:22,240
I'm not ashamed of my body.

201
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,150
Exactly. That's your problem.
You should be.

202
00:12:27,175 --> 00:12:28,353
Don't get up.

203
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,658
Please, allow me.

204
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:36,194
<i>Oh, this is great.

205
00:12:36,359 --> 00:12:38,334
<i>This is what I need,</i>
<i>just what I need.

206
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:41,151
<i>Okay, take it easy.</i>
<i>I'm sure it's nothing.

207
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:43,042
<i>Probably rats on the track.

208
00:12:43,207 --> 00:12:45,094
<i>They're stopping for rats.

209
00:12:45,926 --> 00:12:47,453
<i>God, it's so crowded.

210
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:49,630
<i>How could there be</i>
<i>so many people?

211
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,219
<i>This guy really smells.

212
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,245
<i>Doesn't anyone use deodorant</i>
<i>in the city?

213
00:12:54,406 --> 00:12:56,959
<i>What is so hard?</i>
<i>You take the cap off, you roll it on.

214
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:59,614
<i>What's that? I feel something</i>
<i>rubbing against me.

215
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:03,331
<i>These disgusting animals.</i>
<i>These people should be in a cage.

216
00:13:03,493 --> 00:13:04,704
<i>We are in a cage.

217
00:13:05,478 --> 00:13:06,623
<i>What if I miss the wedding?

218
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:08,164
<i>I got the ring. What'll they do?

219
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:10,715
<i>You can't get married</i>
<i>without a ring. Oh, God</i>--

220
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:12,896
<i>I can't breathe.

221
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:14,403
<i>I feel faint.

222
00:13:14,565 --> 00:13:17,380
<i>Okay, take it easy.</i>
<i>It'll start moving soon.

223
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:20,356
<i>Think about people in concentration</i>
<i>camps, what they went through.

224
00:13:20,518 --> 00:13:23,300
<i>And the hostages! What would</i>
<i>you do if you were a hostage?

225
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:26,046
<i>Think about that. This is nothing.

226
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:28,701
<i>No, it's not nothing, it's something.

227
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:31,454
<i>It's a nightmare. Help me!

228
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:34,370
<i>Move it! Come on!</i>
<i>Move this f****** thing!

229
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:35,907
<i>Why isn't it moving?!

230
00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:38,654
<i>What could go wrong with a train?</i>
<i>It's on tracks.

231
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,755
<i>There's no traffic.</i>
<i>How could a train get stuck?

232
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:43,582
<i>Step on the gas!

233
00:13:43,748 --> 00:13:46,618
<i>What could it be? You'd think the</i>
<i>conductor would explain it to us.

234
00:13:46,788 --> 00:13:49,788
<i>''I'm sorry, there's a delay.</i>
<i>We'll be moving in five minutes. ''

235
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:53,305
<i>I wanna hear a voice.</i>
<i>What's that on my leg?!

236
00:14:03,523 --> 00:14:04,832
Nice.

237
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:08,283
Your company sends you
on the road often, huh?

238
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:12,352
Nice. Oh, hey, nice ice bucket there.

239
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:15,035
Make yourself comfortable.

240
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:18,137
<i>Make myself comfortable?</i>
<i>What does that mean?

241
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:21,372
<i>Does she want me to take my clothes</i>
<i>off? Is she taking her clothes off?

242
00:14:21,635 --> 00:14:23,740
<i>What if I take mine off</i>
<i>and she still has hers on?

243
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:26,295
<i>I'd look like an idiot.</i>
<i>She'd get offended and leave.

244
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,222
<i>So maybe I should leave them on.

245
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:30,753
<i>But what if she takes hers off?</i>
<i>She'll feel humiliated.

246
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,537
<i>''Make yourself comfortable?''</i>
<i>This woman's unbelievable.

247
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:35,389
<i>This ''comfortable'' thing</i>
<i>could ruin me.

248
00:14:35,554 --> 00:14:38,587
<i>I got it. I'll take my shoes off</i>
<i>and sit on the bed.

249
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:39,931
<i>There. That's comfortable.

250
00:14:40,226 --> 00:14:42,615
<i>She can't accuse me</i>
<i>of being uncomfortable.

251
00:14:48,609 --> 00:14:50,431
I gotta tell you,
I'm pretty comfortable.

252
00:14:51,873 --> 00:14:53,051
Oh, yeah, it's all set.

253
00:14:53,313 --> 00:14:55,223
-They've got the bug boy on it.
-The bug boy?

254
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:57,881
Yeah, the little fellow's
been riding his heart out.

255
00:14:58,049 --> 00:14:59,991
-They're gonna break his maiden.
-Really?

256
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:01,567
-Yeah.
-It's a little slow out.

257
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:03,834
-Rained last night.
-This baby loves the slop.

258
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,935
Loves it. Eats it up.
Eats the slop. Born to slop.

259
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:08,315
His father was a mudder.

260
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:10,782
-His father was a mudder.
-His mother was a mudder.

261
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:12,319
His mother was a mudder?

262
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:14,010
What did I just say?

263
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:16,983
Hey. All right.

264
00:15:17,152 --> 00:15:19,902
Six hundred, Pappernick to win.

265
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,415
They still have no pitching.
Gooden's a question mark.

266
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:26,812
You don't recover from those
rotator cuffs so fast.

267
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:29,147
I'm not worried about
the Mets' pitching.

268
00:15:29,311 --> 00:15:32,955
-They got no hitting.
-No, they got hitting. Bonilla, Murray.

269
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,356
-They got no defense.
-Defense, please.

270
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,203
-They need speed.
-Speed? They've got Coleman.

271
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,440
-They need a bullpen.
-Franco's no good?

272
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,876
-They got no team leaders.
-They got Franco.

273
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,566
What they need is a front office.

274
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,066
-But you gotta like their chances.
-I love them.

275
00:15:47,231 --> 00:15:50,646
lf they win it this year, I'll sit naked
with you at the World Series.

276
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:52,794
It's a deal.

277
00:15:55,263 --> 00:15:56,953
<i>Why couldn't I take a cab?

278
00:15:57,118 --> 00:16:00,152
<i>For $6, my whole life</i>
<i>could have changed.

279
00:16:00,734 --> 00:16:03,516
<i>What is that on my leg?

280
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:05,941
<i>I'll never get out of here.

281
00:16:06,526 --> 00:16:09,079
<i>What if I'm here</i>
<i>for the rest of my life?

282
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:11,737
<i>Maybe I'll get out in five seconds.

283
00:16:12,318 --> 00:16:14,357
<i>One banana, two banana...

284
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:16,696
<i>...three banana, four banana...

285
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:18,388
<i>...five banana.

286
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,652
<i>No. I'm still here.

287
00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:25,273
<i>Still here.</i>
<i>When will they start moving?

288
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:26,779
<i>Move!

289
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:29,494
<i>Move! Move!

290
00:16:30,653 --> 00:16:32,114
<i>It's moving.

291
00:16:32,477 --> 00:16:34,102
<i>It's moving!

292
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:36,147
<i>Yes!

293
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:37,655
<i>Yes.

294
00:16:39,644 --> 00:16:41,237
<i>Mother******!

295
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,978
Gee, I hope you have the key
for these things.

296
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:53,106
Oh, don't worry, I do.

297
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,409
My mother used to walk
around our apartment...

298
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,824
...in her bra and panties.

299
00:16:57,532 --> 00:17:00,630
She didn't look anything like you.
She was...

300
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:03,992
...really disgusting, really bad body.

301
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,888
You know, if you can imagine an
uglier, fatter version of Shirley Booth.

302
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:11,057
Remember Shirley Booth in <i>Hazel</i>?

303
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:13,784
Really embarrassing,
because I had the only mother...

304
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:15,987
...in the neighborhood
who was worse than Hazel.

305
00:17:16,155 --> 00:17:19,155
-You can imagine the taunts I'd hear.
-Like what?

306
00:17:19,323 --> 00:17:20,730
Like:

307
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:23,539
''Hey, your mother's
uglier than Hazel.''

308
00:17:23,898 --> 00:17:26,516
''Hazel really puts your mother
to shame.'' You know.

309
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:35,605
What's going on?

310
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:38,964
It was a pleasure doing business
with you, but I have to get going.

311
00:17:39,418 --> 00:17:42,484
Get going? But we haven't really,
you know....

312
00:17:42,714 --> 00:17:44,121
Eight dollars?

313
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:46,387
-Eight dollars?
-What are you doing, robbing me?

314
00:17:46,554 --> 00:17:48,725
I wasted my whole morning
on you for $8?

315
00:17:49,977 --> 00:17:51,439
Wait a second.
What are you doing?

316
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,137
-I'm taking your clothes.
-No, no, that's my only suit!

317
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:57,112
It cost me $350!
I got it at Moe Ginsburg!

318
00:17:57,273 --> 00:17:59,826
-Bye, George.
-You can't just leave me here.

319
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,741
Will I see you again?

320
00:18:09,016 --> 00:18:11,121
<i>It's Hoy's Boy followed by Jamet...

321
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:14,070
<i>...Little Baggit, Kiss Harmony</i>
<i>and then a long way to Flagrant.

322
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:16,949
-Come on!
-<i>Into the stretch...

323
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:20,211
<i>...with an 1/8th of a mile to go,</i>
<i>Stepagain, Passionel battling it out.

324
00:18:20,377 --> 00:18:23,027
<i>Clear from Jamet, Pappernick's</i>
<i>starting to make some ground...

325
00:18:23,192 --> 00:18:26,541
-<i>...but Stepagain is the leader....</i>
-Come on.

326
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:29,876
-Come on! Yes!
-<i>Look at Pappernick, sprouting wings.

327
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,276
-Yes! Yes!
-<i>Stepagain, just falling back.

328
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,545
-Yes!
-<i>Pappernick flashing home.

329
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:38,159
<i>Stepagain, Pappernick, Pappernick</i>
<i>and Stepagain to the line....	

330
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:41,934
-Yes! Yes! Yes!
-<i>The winner is Pappernick.

331
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:45,104
Yes, yes! I won. Hey!

332
00:18:52,023 --> 00:18:53,200
Yeah.

333
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:31,123
I haven't had a hot dog
at Nathan's in 20 years.

334
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:32,627
First, we ride the Cyclone.

335
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:35,691
Chilly out.

336
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,140
French fries.

337
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:48,942
Hey, hey!

338
00:19:50,388 --> 00:19:52,560
Give me the money.

339
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,547
Freeze! Police!

340
00:20:00,628 --> 00:20:02,799
No, I never got the car.
We had such a good time...

341
00:20:02,964 --> 00:20:05,811
...by the time I got to
the police garage, it was closed.

342
00:20:06,835 --> 00:20:08,013
Too bad.

343
00:20:08,244 --> 00:20:11,179
You wouldn't believe what this guy
put away at Nathan's.

344
00:20:11,347 --> 00:20:13,519
Look at what we won.
You want him?

345
00:20:13,684 --> 00:20:15,025
Get that out of my face.

346
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:19,184
So you missed the wedding.
You'll catch the <i>bris</i>.

347
00:20:26,035 --> 00:20:28,817
<i>Hare Krishna! Hare Krishna!

348
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:32,299
How'd you like a Hare Krishna fist
down your throat, you little punk?

349
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:35,432
George.

350
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:36,780
Biff.

351
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:39,665
What, did you whistle
on the elevator?

352
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:41,833
I have my spare key
in your apartment, right?

353
00:20:42,322 --> 00:20:43,566
Yeah, in the kitchen drawer.

354
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,388
-Give me your key.
-What happened?

355
00:20:45,554 --> 00:20:48,718
Never mind what happened,
just give me the key.

356
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:51,915
-Come on, I'll go with you.
-Here. Pay.

357
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:55,118
Wait, wait. Give me that.

358
00:21:01,457 --> 00:21:02,984
All right.

359
00:21:04,593 --> 00:21:07,659
So I take the subway
down to Coney Island...

360
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:09,963
...to go on the Cyclone.
I'm riding on the subway.

361
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:13,195
I'm sitting on the D train
for an hour and 1 5 minutes...

362
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:15,816
...to go on a scary ride.

363
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:18,056
Okay, how dumb is that?

364
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:21,387
You know that first sharp drop
on the Cyclone? Fell asleep.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
