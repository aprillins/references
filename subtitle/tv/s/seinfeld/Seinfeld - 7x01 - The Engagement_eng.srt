1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,558
Well, you got no place to go.

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,469
Your problem is you brought
your queen out too fast.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,550
What do you think, she's a feminist
looking to get out of the house?

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,160
No, the queen is old-fashioned.
Likes to stay home, cook.

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,709
Take care of her man.
Make sure he feels good.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,592
Checkmate.

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,873
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

8
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,399
Shut up!

9
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,032
Shut up, you stupid mutt!

10
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,749
You broke up with her
because she beat you at chess?

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,909
That's pretty sick.

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,470
I don't see how I could perform
sexually after something like that.

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,513
I was completely emasculated.

14
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,238
Anyway, it's not the only reason.

15
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,675
- Yeah, what else?
- All right.

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,400
You wanna know what
one of her favourite expressions is:

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,471
"Happy, pappy?"

18
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,713
"Happy, pappy?"
What does that mean?

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,599
If she wants to know if I'm pleased
with something, she'll say:

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,273
"Happy, pappy?"

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,428
- Oh, you're pappy.
- I'm pappy.

22
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,160
- Oh, I get it. I see.
- Yeah.

23
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,035
- So that's not so bad.
- Come on. What, are you kidding?

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,553
So tell her not to say it.

25
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,958
I'm much more comfortable
criticizing people behind their backs.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,875
Look who's talking.
You just broke up with Melanie...

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,076
...because she shushed you
while you watched TV.

28
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,800
Hey, I got a real thing
about shushing.

29
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,559
What is this?

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,269
You ever get the feeling like you had
a haircut, but you didn't have one?

31
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,715
I'm all itchy back here.

32
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,835
- What?
- What is this?

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,319
What are we doing?

34
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,796
What in God's name are we doing?

35
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,633
- What?
- Our lives.

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,791
What kind of lives are these?

37
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,670
- We're like children. We're not men.
- No, we're not. We're not men.

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,593
We come up with all these stupid
reasons to break up with women.

39
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,990
I know, I know. That's what I do.
That's what I do.

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,238
Are we gonna be sitting here
when we're 60, like two idiots?

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,789
We should be having dinner
with our sons when we're 60.

42
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,078
- We're pathetic, you know that?
- Like I don't know that I'm pathetic.

43
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,789
- Why can't I be normal?
- Yes, me too.

44
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,235
I wanna be normal. Normal!

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,516
It would be nice
to care about someone.

46
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,717
Yes. Yes, care.

47
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,270
You know who I think about a lot?

48
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,394
Remember Susan,
the one that used to work for NBC?

49
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,676
I thought she became a lesbian.

50
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,632
No, it didn't take.

51
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,757
Did I tell you I ran into her last week?
She looked great.

52
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,309
You thought she was
good-looking, right?

53
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,199
See, there you go again.
What is the difference what I think?

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,238
- I was just curious.
- Well, this is it.

55
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,470
I'm really gonna do something
about my life.

56
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,438
I think I'm gonna call Melanie again.
So what if she shushed me?

57
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,034
George, I am really
gonna make some changes.

58
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,316
- Yes, changes.
- I'm serious about it.

59
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,833
- Think I'm not?
- I'm not kidding.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,672
Me too.

61
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,191
Melanie, you can shush me
at every opportunity.

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,516
So we're all straightened out?

63
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,591
You happy, pappy?

64
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,115
Oh, it's just an expression.

65
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,033
All right. That's very sweet of you.
Okay, I'll call you later. All right. Bye.

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,395
Hey.

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,918
Well, I had a very interesting lunch
with George Costanza today.

68
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,877
- Really?
- We were talking about our lives...

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,349
...and we both kind of realized...

70
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,715
...we're kids. We're not men.

71
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,997
So then you asked yourselves,
"Isn't there something more to life?"

72
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,151
Yes, we did.

73
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,390
Yeah. Well, let me clue you in
on something:

74
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,834
There isn't.

75
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,148
- There isn't?
- Absolutely not.

76
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,869
I mean, what are you thinking
about, Jerry? Marriage? Family?

77
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,829
- Well...
- They're prisons.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,151
Man-made prisons. You're doing time.

79
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,550
You get up in the morning,
she's there.

80
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,472
You go to sleep at night,
she's there.

81
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,950
It's like you gotta ask permission
to use the bathroom.

82
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,749
"Is it all right
if I use the bathroom now?"

83
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,156
- Really?
- You can forget about watching TV...

84
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,151
...while you're eating.

85
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,039
- I can?
- Oh, yeah!

86
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,351
You know why?
Because it's dinnertime.

87
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,431
- And you know what you do at dinner?
- What?

88
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,876
You talk about your day.

89
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,109
"How was your day today?

90
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,033
Did you have a good day or
a bad day? What kind of day was it?"

91
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,033
"I don't know. How about you?
How was your day?"

92
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,471
- Boy.
- It's sad, Jerry.

93
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,358
It's a sad state of affairs.

94
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,958
- I'm glad we had this talk.
- Oh, you have no idea.

95
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,348
- Hey.
- Hey.

96
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,193
Three hours of sleep again last night.

97
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,636
Three hours of sleep
because of that dog.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,195
- What dog?
- Why don't you call the police?

99
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,397
- I did, Jerry. They won't do anything.
- Yeah. What dog?

100
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,314
There is this dog in the courtyard
across from my bedroom window...

101
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,869
...that never, ever stops barking.

102
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,399
I lost my voice
just screaming at this thing.

103
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,028
I can't sleep. I can't work.

104
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,509
I mean, I just moved.
I can't move again.

105
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,558
What am I gonna do? What?
What am I gonna do?

106
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,190
- Well, there is something you can do.
- What? Kramer, I'll do anything.

107
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,478
Well, what if there should be
an unfortunate accident?

108
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,152
You're gonna rub out the dog?

109
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,432
No, no. Not me.

110
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,670
I just happen to know someone
who specializes...

111
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,674
...in exactly these kinds
of sticky situations.

112
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,032
What, you're considering this?

113
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,512
Just meet with him. See what he has
to say. You got nothing to lose.

114
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,793
l... I don't really know why I'm here.
Kramer talked me into coming here...

115
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,554
...but obviously I could never
really do anything.

116
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,637
Of course.

117
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,234
Obviously.

118
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,438
Well, so anyway,
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

119
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,558
What kind of dog did you say it was?

120
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,880
- I don't know. I've never really seen it.
- I see many dogs on my mail route.

121
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,396
I'll bet there's not one type of mutt
or mongrel I haven't run across.

122
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,109
If you ask me, they have no business
living amongst us. Vile, useless...

123
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,794
Newman! Newman!

124
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,473
Stop it.

125
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,749
- Anyway.
- Yeah.

126
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,432
Well, I was just curious...

127
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,628
...if I were interested
in availing myself of your services...

128
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,631
...what exactly would you do?

129
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,235
Well, Elaine...

130
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,191
...there's any number of things
that I could do.

131
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,510
But I can promise you this, though:

132
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,956
This vicious beast
will never bother you again.

133
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,314
So, what's it gonna be?

134
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,196
No, I'm sorry. I can't hurt a dog.

135
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,954
- I can't hurt a dog. I can't.
- Wait a minute. I got it.

136
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,556
We'll kidnap it. We'll kidnap the dog,
we'll drop him off upstate.

137
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,075
Then he won't bother you anymore
and he won't get hurt.

138
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,549
Yeah, I suppose.

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,878
I'd have to think about it.
I doubt it, though. I'll let you know.

140
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,076
Of course, take your time.

141
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,629
I'll be here.

142
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,551
All right. Let's do it.

143
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,672
Excellent.

144
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,591
Excellent.

145
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,269
How come you eat your peas
one at a time?

146
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,556
Well, what's the hurry?

147
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,554
Who is it?

148
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,597
- It's George.
- George?

149
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,794
George, what is it?

150
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,389
Will you marry me?

151
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,271
- Hello?
- Ma, guess what?

152
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,796
- Oh, my God.
- No, it's nothing bad.

153
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,155
- I'm getting married!
- You what?

154
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,029
- I'm getting married!
- Oh, my God. You're getting married?

155
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,952
- Yes.
- Oh, I can't believe it.

156
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,680
- Frank, come here.
- You come here.

157
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,070
- Georgie's getting married.
- What?

158
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,879
- Georgie's getting married!
- Get the hell out of here.

159
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,359
- He's getting married?
- Yes.

160
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,431
- To a woman?
- Of course a woman.

161
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,749
What does she look lik e?

162
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,148
I'm sure she's gorgeous.

163
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,754
- What differences does it make?
- Is she pretty?

164
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,672
Yes. What difference does to make?

165
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,114
I'm just curious!

166
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,510
- She's not pretty?
- Let me talk to her.

167
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,908
She wants to talk to you.

168
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,550
- Hello?
- Congratulations.

169
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,757
I just want you to know
that I love your son very much.

170
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,069
- You do?
- Yes.

171
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,434
- Really?
- Yes.

172
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,353
- May I ask why?
- Okay, let me talk to her.

173
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,273
- Will you stop? I'm on the telephone.
- Can I talk to her, please?

174
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,714
- Hey.
- Hey.

175
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,314
- What are you up to?
- Nothing.

176
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,234
What's the rope for?

177
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,954
Well, how do you like that?
I got rope.

178
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,148
Well, I gotta go.

179
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,068
- The dog. You're getting the dog!
- Kramer, where you going?

180
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,676
- Out!
- Don't go. Kramer! Come back.

181
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,195
I got great news!

182
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,513
Well...

183
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,791
...I did it.

184
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,112
- Did what?
- I got engaged. I'm getting married.

185
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,113
I asked Susan to marry me.
We're getting married this Christmas.

186
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,397
- You're getting married?
- Yes!

187
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,360
- Oh, my God!
- I asked her to get married.

188
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,432
I'm a man. Jerry, I'm a man.

189
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,430
And do you know why?

190
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,670
It's because of that talk we had.

191
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,957
You were my inspiration.
Do you believe it? You.

192
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,429
That lunch was the defining moment
of my life.

193
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,749
- I'm blown away!
- Are you blown?

194
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,797
- Blown!
- You like that?

195
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,394
- And she said yes?
- Well...

196
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,632
...it took a couple hours of convincing,
but I was persistent.

197
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,268
I was just like those guys
in the movies, and it worked.

198
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,079
She said yes.
I can't believe my luck...

199
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,915
...that she was still available,
a beautiful woman like that.

200
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,991
You think she's good-looking, right?

201
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,038
You're gonna have gorgeous kids.

202
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,395
She's got great skin.
She's got a rosy glow.

203
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,755
- A pinkish hue?
- Oh, she's got the hue.

204
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:35,833
So, what's going on with Melanie?
I know you're not getting married...

205
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,309
...but things are happening?
- Well...

206
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,314
...actually, we kind of broke up.

207
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,795
You what?

208
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,833
Well, we were having dinner,
and she's got the strangest habit.

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,878
She eats her peas one at a time.

210
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,192
You've never seen anything like it.
It takes her an hour to finish them.

211
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,873
We've had dinner other times.

212
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,635
I've seen her eat corn niblets,
but she scooped them.

213
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,638
- She scooped the niblets?
- Yes.

214
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,314
That's what was so vexing.

215
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,791
- What about the pact?
- What?

216
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,439
What happened to the pact?

217
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,636
We were gonna change.
We shook hands on a pact.

218
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,631
Did you not shake my hand
on a pact?

219
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,110
You stuck your hand out,
so I shook it.

220
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,554
I don't know about a pact.

221
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,029
Anyway, you should be happy.
You're engaged.

222
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,599
You're getting married.

223
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,149
Well, it's not that. I just... You know,
I thought that we were both...

224
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,276
You thought
I was gonna get married?

225
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,476
Well, maybe not married, but...

226
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,437
I mean, you love Susan, right?

227
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,713
Yeah.

228
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,269
You wanna spend
the rest of your life with her.

229
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,753
Yeah.

230
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,118
So?

231
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,638
Yeah.

232
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,640
- This doesn't make any difference.
- No.

233
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,832
- So we're still on to see Firestorm?
- Yeah.

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,389
I'll pick you up at your apartment.
We'll go to the 8.

235
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,399
- Yeah.
- Hey, wait a second. Wait a second!

236
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,198
Celebrate!
How about some champagne?

237
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,918
- Champagne?
- Yes, come on!

238
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,957
How often do you get engaged?

239
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,190
- Come on.
- Okay. All right.

240
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,917
You know what?

241
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,032
No champagne.

242
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,156
Anyway, I'll see you later.

243
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,509
Yeah.

244
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,756
That's it. That's it.
Stop right here.

245
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,480
How much is that doggie
In the window?

246
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,278
Will you shut up?

247
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,237
Is that a new song?

248
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,913
All right, give me the rope.

249
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,832
What? What do you need
a rope for?

250
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,514
- Look, I don't have time to explain.
- Oh, I don't know.

251
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,352
I'm thinking
maybe we shouldn't do this.

252
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,875
- I knew you'd back out.
- Are we doing a bad thing?

253
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:11,749
Look, we drop the dog off in front
of somebody's house in the country.

254
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,558
They find it and adopt it.

255
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,679
Now the dog is prancing in the fields,
dancing and prancing.

256
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,796
Fresh air, dandelions.

257
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,110
We're doing this dog a huge favour.

258
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,949
Yeah, yeah.

259
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,640
- That's him.
- All right.

260
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,789
I'm going in.

261
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,431
Keep the motor running.

262
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,549
Ready?

263
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,792
- I don't really think I can go.
- Oh, how come?

264
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,316
Well, I didn't really tell Susan
about it...

265
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,392
...and she doesn't really
have anything else to do.

266
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,788
She can come.

267
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,358
Well, she doesn't
really wanna see Firestorm.

268
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,794
She...

269
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,193
She wants to see The Muted Heart.

270
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,992
Oh, The Muted Heart. Glenn Close,
Sally Field. That should be good.

271
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:07,993
- Yeah. I guess I'll see you later.
- Wait. We can share a cab.

272
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,958
- They're playing at the same Cineplex.
- George, better get ready.

273
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,113
I am ready.

274
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,794
You're wearing that shirt?

275
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,268
- Okay, I guess I'll see you down there.
- Yeah.

276
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,279
- What time you got?
- No, I don't wear a watch.

277
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,593
- Well, what do you do?
- Well, I tell time by the sun.

278
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,832
- How close do you get?
- Well, I can guess within an hour.

279
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,955
Well, I can guess within the hour, and
I don't even have to look at the sun.

280
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,518
What about at night?
What do you then?

281
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,752
Well, night's tougher.
But it's only a couple of hours.

282
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,559
- Okay, let's go. Move.
- You got it?

283
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,756
What do you think?
Drive! Drive!

284
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,439
Where is it? Where is it?

285
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,473
This?

286
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,108
- This is the dog?
- Yep.

287
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,953
- But it's so small.
- Yeah, but he's a fighter.

288
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,680
That can't be the dog.
You sure you got the right one?

289
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,115
You said the second courtyard.
He was there.

290
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,157
- How could that be it?
- Get him to bark.

291
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,709
- Yeah, I'll know it if it barks.
- All right. Bark.

292
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,029
- Bark!
- Bark!

293
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,553
- Bark!
- Bark!

294
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,914
- Bark!
- Bark!

295
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,637
- Did you like it?
- Yes, it was very, very good.

296
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,509
- Do you think he'll ever find her?
- Oh, I sure hope so.

297
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,750
How about when Ford
jumped out of that plane...

298
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,672
...and was shooting back
as he was falling?

299
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,037
- What about the underwater escape?
- Oh, man.

300
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,833
Let's put the radio on.
Maybe there's a news report about it.

301
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,479
Let's dump it. I'm getting antsy.

302
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,995
- Think we're far enough?
- We're nearly to Monticello.

303
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,516
Yeah. I think this looks right.

304
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,597
All right. Give me the dog.

305
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,072
- Yeah, that's it. Yeah.
- There.

306
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,509
Okay, boy. This is it.

307
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,830
This is your new home.

308
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,833
Let go. Let go of my shirt.

309
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,231
Come on. Let go of my shirt!
This shirt is from Rudy's!

310
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,117
- Hello.
- MSG's rerunning the Yankee game.

311
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,474
- You watching?
- They are?

312
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,679
George, are you coming to bed?
I taped Mad About You.

313
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,552
Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

314
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,914
What was that?

315
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,469
- Nothing. I gotta go.
- Oh, Mattingly just singled.

316
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,360
You know, it was very wrong of you
to back out on that deal.

317
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,796
- I just shook your hand.
- That's a deal where I come from.

318
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,632
We come from the same place.

319
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,836
George, I'm starting it.

320
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,036
I gotta go.

321
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,834
Roxy, where have you been?

322
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,436
We've been worried sick about you.

323
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,952
What's this?

324
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,676
No. No, it's impossible.

325
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,355
It's impossible.

326
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,031
I don't know how it happened.
We were practically in Monticello.

327
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,510
I mean, how could that thing have
found its way back? There is no way.

328
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,359
- Very strange.
- I know.

329
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,193
So tell me, anyway,
who was the big mastermind?

330
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,955
I can't, Jerry. I'm sworn to secrecy.

331
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,236
All right. But then I can't tell you
the big news.

332
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,631
News? What news?

333
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,472
Sorry.

334
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,598
What? What?

335
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,391
All right, Elaine.
But this is beyond news.

336
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,869
This is like Pearl Harbor
or the Kennedy assassination.

337
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,031
It's, like, not even news,
it's total shock.

338
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,239
Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please,
please, please, please.

339
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,593
George Costanza...

340
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,193
Yeah?

341
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,873
...is getting married!

342
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,591
Get out!

343
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,314
Hi.

344
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,675
- You Cosmo Kramer?
- Yes. Yeah.

345
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,079
- You recognize this piece of fabric?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's...

346
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,593
What?

347
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,389
Nothing.

348
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,232
- You're under arrest.
- Arrest?

349
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,994
I have a receipt for a rental car
with your signature...

350
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,152
...including a report of some damage
to the rear seat.

351
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,676
It seems as if the springs
were so compressed...

352
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,877
- ...that they collapsed the right side.
- Newman!

353
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,829
What took you so long?

354
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,112
- What do you think they'll do to us?
- Don't worry about a thing.

355
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,192
In 20 minutes, that place
will be swarming with mailmen.

356
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,875
We'll be back on the street
by lunch.

357
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,352
I gotta make some changes.

358
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,751
I'm not a woman. I'm a child.

359
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,436
What kind of life is this?
