1
01:27:15,013 --> 01:27:16,571
The thing about birthday parties...

2
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:21,017
...is that the first and last party
you have are quite similar.

3
01:27:21,186 --> 01:27:22,744
You just kind of sit there.

4
01:27:22,921 --> 01:27:25,822
You're the least excited person
at the party.

5
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:28,687
You don't even realize
that there is a party.

6
01:27:28,860 --> 01:27:30,418
You don't know what's going on.

7
01:27:30,762 --> 01:27:33,196
Both birthday parties,
people have to help you...

8
01:27:33,365 --> 01:27:36,357
...blow out the candles. You don't
even know why you're doing it.

9
01:27:36,535 --> 01:27:38,935
What is this ritual?
What is going on?

10
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:42,940
lt's also the only two birthday parties
where other people have to gather...

11
01:27:43,108 --> 01:27:45,474
...your friends together for you.

12
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:48,639
Sometimes they're not your friends.
They make the judgment.

13
01:27:48,813 --> 01:27:53,216
They bring them in, and they tell you,
''These are your friends.

14
01:27:53,585 --> 01:27:56,520
Tell them, 'Thank you for coming
to my birthday party.'''

15
01:28:00,158 --> 01:28:02,683
These are great. Just great.

16
01:28:02,861 --> 01:28:06,957
Really great. Really, really great.
Don't you think so, Elaine?

17
01:28:07,966 --> 01:28:09,627
Yeah. Really great.

18
01:28:10,468 --> 01:28:12,902
A coffee table book
about coffee tables.

19
01:28:13,071 --> 01:28:15,335
How did you come up
with this idea?

20
01:28:15,574 --> 01:28:17,132
lt was there.

21
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:20,170
Look at this one. lt's saying,
''l'm a coffee table.

22
01:28:20,345 --> 01:28:23,781
Put some coffee on me. The hotter
the better. That's what l'm here for.''

23
01:28:24,182 --> 01:28:27,117
You know, actually,
l've got some work l've got to do.

24
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:30,252
How about if the book came
with these little foldout legs...

25
01:28:30,422 --> 01:28:33,220
...so the book itself
becomes a coffee table?

26
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:35,052
That is a great idea.

27
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:36,785
Really, really great.

28
01:28:39,431 --> 01:28:43,663
And that coffee table is saying,
''Put some coffee on me.''

29
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:47,061
l'd like to put some coffee on her.
Hot, scalding coffee...

30
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:50,538
...right in her face. l swear, this is
like working with a contestant...

31
01:28:50,709 --> 01:28:53,109
...from <i>The Price Is Right.</i>

32
01:28:55,547 --> 01:28:56,946
Yeah, that's real interesting.

33
01:28:57,115 --> 01:28:59,549
Listen, tell me
if you think this is funny.

34
01:29:00,185 --> 01:29:03,086
''Men definitely hit the remote
more than women.

35
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:08,249
Men don't care what's on TV.
Men only care what else is on TV.

36
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:11,395
Women wanna see what the show is
before they change the channel...

37
01:29:11,563 --> 01:29:13,258
...because men hunt
and women nest.''

38
01:29:13,431 --> 01:29:15,160
Yeah, it's funny. l don't know.

39
01:29:16,534 --> 01:29:18,502
You don't know?
Come on, that's gold.

40
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:22,697
-Well, l don't know about gold.
-Oh, that's gold, baby.

41
01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:27,673
-''Baby''? Are you doing George now?
-l was saying ''baby'' before George.

42
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:29,944
Don't ask me
any more questions...

43
01:29:30,115 --> 01:29:32,447
...about jokes.
lt puts pressure on me.

44
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,346
Leonard Christian's gonna be there.

45
01:29:34,519 --> 01:29:35,747
Yeah? Who's he?

46
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:39,378
A writer from <i>Entertainment Weekly.</i>
l would like to have a good show.

47
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:43,026
-<i>Danke schön</i>, my little dumplings.
-Hi.

48
01:29:43,194 --> 01:29:45,458
-Hey, how about that Toby?
-Yeah, how about her?

49
01:29:45,897 --> 01:29:48,991
She's a package full of energy.

50
01:29:49,501 --> 01:29:52,470
-She's a package full of something.
-And that something is life.

51
01:29:52,771 --> 01:29:55,831
You got to meet her.
She's brimming with positivity.

52
01:29:56,007 --> 01:29:58,976
-Oh, please.
-Hey.

53
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:00,975
-Are you performing tomorrow?
-Yeah.

54
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:02,477
Great. l'm gonna bring Toby.

55
01:30:02,647 --> 01:30:04,308
You better laugh.
l'm being reviewed.

56
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:07,144
-Leonard Christian's gonna be there.
-She's a great laugher.

57
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:10,049
Yeah. She's a great laugher, Jerry.

58
01:30:10,221 --> 01:30:13,019
''Really, really great.''

59
01:30:13,525 --> 01:30:15,755
Want to sit with George?
He's coming with Robin.

60
01:30:15,927 --> 01:30:18,361
-ls that the waitress from the club?
-Yeah.

61
01:30:18,530 --> 01:30:21,499
-ls she bringing her kid too?
-She's got a kid?

62
01:30:21,666 --> 01:30:24,396
You should see George
get along with this kid.

63
01:30:25,970 --> 01:30:28,131
What are you doing under there?
Stop that.

64
01:30:28,306 --> 01:30:30,001
Don't eat that. That's not food.

65
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:33,941
-He's sucking down Equal packets.
-Do you think 25 kids is too much?

66
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:36,774
Twenty-five kids
for his birthday party?

67
01:30:37,015 --> 01:30:41,008
Don't put your tongue on the floor.
He's putting his tongue on the floor.

68
01:30:41,186 --> 01:30:44,121
Here, here.
Have some more sugar packets.

69
01:30:44,322 --> 01:30:45,949
So, what about entertainment?

70
01:30:46,157 --> 01:30:48,523
-Should l get Barney?
-No Barney.

71
01:30:49,094 --> 01:30:51,255
-Maybe a clown.
-How about Bozo?

72
01:30:51,429 --> 01:30:53,226
Who's Bozo?

73
01:30:53,465 --> 01:30:56,798
Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown.
That's who Bozo is.

74
01:30:56,968 --> 01:30:59,869
When l was a kid, Bozo the Clown
was the clown, bar none.

75
01:31:00,071 --> 01:31:01,868
-George.
-With the orange hair...

76
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,531
-...the big clown shirt with the ruffles.
-George.

77
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:07,405
-A TV show, he had cartoons.
-George!

78
01:31:07,579 --> 01:31:10,377
Forget Bozo, George.
Bozo's out.

79
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:13,483
He's finished. lt's over for Bozo.

80
01:31:13,918 --> 01:31:16,682
When l was a kid,
we didn't have these parties...

81
01:31:16,855 --> 01:31:19,119
...with catered food
and entertainment.

82
01:31:19,391 --> 01:31:21,154
l remember
my seventh birthday party.

83
01:31:21,326 --> 01:31:23,260
Blow out the candles!
Blow out the candles!

84
01:31:23,428 --> 01:31:25,259
l said blow out the damn candles!

85
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:29,491
-Stop it, Frank! You're killing him!
-Blow out the candles!

86
01:31:31,035 --> 01:31:34,129
Well, this time,
you can blow out the candles.

87
01:31:34,372 --> 01:31:37,739
No, l have asthma. Ben. Ben!

88
01:31:40,979 --> 01:31:42,640
Hi.

89
01:31:43,081 --> 01:31:45,413
-Hi, Toby.
-How are you doing today?

90
01:31:46,117 --> 01:31:47,982
Fine.

91
01:31:52,056 --> 01:31:55,025
-How are you?
-Oh, l'm great. Just great.

92
01:31:55,193 --> 01:31:56,421
Really great.

93
01:31:58,062 --> 01:32:01,190
-Hey, did you hear about Bob Rosen?
-No.

94
01:32:01,366 --> 01:32:04,267
He's going to Knopf.
He's going to be a vice president.

95
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:05,698
Knopf? Really?

96
01:32:06,204 --> 01:32:09,230
Boy, that means there's
an opening here for...

97
01:32:09,474 --> 01:32:12,807
...senior editor.
Has Lippman hired anyone?

98
01:32:12,977 --> 01:32:15,707
No. l hear he wants
to promote someone in-house.

99
01:32:16,681 --> 01:32:19,548
-Really?
-Maybe it'll be you.

100
01:32:20,952 --> 01:32:22,943
-Well--
-You really deserve it.

101
01:32:23,855 --> 01:32:25,823
-Well--
-l mean, you have experience...

102
01:32:25,990 --> 01:32:28,959
...seniority, Lippman really respects
your opinion.

103
01:32:30,061 --> 01:32:31,585
Well<i>....</i>

104
01:32:33,731 --> 01:32:35,665
-Hey, it could be you.
-No.

105
01:32:36,201 --> 01:32:38,726
-No, really.
-Really? You think so?

106
01:32:39,103 --> 01:32:42,300
-Sure.
-Boy, wouldn't that be exciting?

107
01:32:42,941 --> 01:32:48,004
-Stranger things have happened.
-Me, a senior editor. l'd like that.

108
01:32:48,213 --> 01:32:50,147
You shouldn't get your hopes up.

109
01:32:50,715 --> 01:32:53,377
Well, it's a possibility.
Like you said...

110
01:32:53,585 --> 01:32:57,817
...stranger things have happened.
Thank you, Elaine. Thank you.

111
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:05,053
-Hey, Ronnie.
-Hey.

112
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:06,993
Can l have a club soda?

113
01:33:07,165 --> 01:33:08,393
-Going on tonight?
-Yeah.

114
01:33:08,566 --> 01:33:09,794
-You?
-Yeah.

115
01:33:09,968 --> 01:33:12,027
-You know, Leonard Christian's here.
-l know.

116
01:33:12,203 --> 01:33:16,037
Can l ask you something?
Are my nostrils getting bigger?

117
01:33:17,775 --> 01:33:20,243
-l don't think so.
-Are you sure?

118
01:33:20,411 --> 01:33:22,242
Take a look.
Do they seem a little bigger?

119
01:33:22,413 --> 01:33:23,880
l don't know. l don't know.

120
01:33:24,048 --> 01:33:26,380
ls it possible for nostrils to expand?

121
01:33:26,618 --> 01:33:29,086
-ls this a bit?
-Hey, l don't do bits.

122
01:33:29,254 --> 01:33:31,245
l'm a prop comic.

123
01:33:31,422 --> 01:33:35,085
Damn it. l can't find my water gun.
l can't go on without my water gun.

124
01:33:35,593 --> 01:33:37,026
-Hey, Jerry.
-Hey.

125
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:40,722
-Well, here's Toby. Jerry.
-This is so exciting.

126
01:33:40,932 --> 01:33:43,594
Look. l have goose bumps. Touch.

127
01:33:43,768 --> 01:33:45,201
Touch them.

128
01:33:46,838 --> 01:33:48,635
-Hey.
-l've never been...

129
01:33:48,806 --> 01:33:51,400
-...to a comedy club before.
-Really?

130
01:33:51,576 --> 01:33:54,306
Many restaurants are serving
brewed decaf now too.

131
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:59,539
-You are so funny.
-You'll have a good time, l swear.

132
01:34:00,118 --> 01:34:03,849
He swears, like he thinks
l don't believe him. l believe you.

133
01:34:04,022 --> 01:34:05,922
-He's so funny.
-What about me?

134
01:34:06,090 --> 01:34:07,614
What about you?

135
01:34:08,693 --> 01:34:11,093
l'm only kidding. You're funny too.

136
01:34:11,262 --> 01:34:12,490
l love to laugh.

137
01:34:12,664 --> 01:34:14,564
-Good.
-So you up next?

138
01:34:14,732 --> 01:34:16,666
Yeah. Why don't you guys
get a good table.

139
01:34:16,834 --> 01:34:18,995
We don't want some jerk
sitting in front of us.

140
01:34:19,170 --> 01:34:21,263
lt'll be like, ''Hey, big-head,
can you move?

141
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:24,408
l didn't pay a cover charge
to stare at your bald spot.''

142
01:34:25,810 --> 01:34:27,471
-So you have a good show.
-Yeah.

143
01:34:27,645 --> 01:34:30,910
Have a great show. Hey, we'll
make sure it's a great show.

144
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:33,243
-Okay. Good. l'll see you later.
-Yeah.

145
01:34:33,952 --> 01:34:38,446
He's so great. This is so great.
l'm so excited.

146
01:34:39,924 --> 01:34:42,620
Men definitely hit the remote button
more than women.

147
01:34:42,794 --> 01:34:46,753
-Really, really. That is so true.
-Yes, l-- Yeah.

148
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:49,263
Men don't care what's on TV.

149
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:51,766
Men only care what else is on TV.

150
01:34:52,537 --> 01:34:55,028
Yes. Right on, right on.

151
01:34:56,541 --> 01:34:57,769
See, women--

152
01:34:57,942 --> 01:35:01,503
Women wanna see what the show is
before they change the channel.

153
01:35:01,746 --> 01:35:04,647
That is so true. Yes, yes.

154
01:35:05,350 --> 01:35:07,841
That's why men hunt
and women nest.

155
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:16,317
Yeah, anyway-- Yeah, all right.

156
01:35:16,494 --> 01:35:19,520
So anyway<i>....</i>
What was l talking about?

157
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:26,296
-Hey.
-Hey. What's the deal?

158
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:29,338
l invite you down here,
l have an important show...

159
01:35:29,507 --> 01:35:31,998
-...and she heckles me?
-She didn't mean anything.

160
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:36,112
-What's the matter? ls she crazy?
-She's just enthusiastic, that's all.

161
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:39,078
-Hey, what is wrong with you?
-Me?

162
01:35:39,384 --> 01:35:42,046
-Nothing's wrong with me.
-You boo me?

163
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:45,747
You hiss? You didn't stop blathering
throughout the whole set.

164
01:35:45,923 --> 01:35:49,051
Come on. l thought you're a pro.
That's part of the show.

165
01:35:49,227 --> 01:35:51,559
No. Not part of the show.

166
01:35:51,729 --> 01:35:53,924
Booing and hissing
are not part of the show.

167
01:35:54,098 --> 01:35:57,556
You boo puppets.
You hiss villains in silent movies.

168
01:35:58,002 --> 01:35:59,936
That's the way l express myself.

169
01:36:00,104 --> 01:36:02,197
How will you make it
if you can't take it?

170
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:05,402
-l can take it.
-Let's go.

171
01:36:05,943 --> 01:36:08,309
Hey, man, good set.

172
01:36:14,352 --> 01:36:17,253
-Bozo?
-No.

173
01:36:17,522 --> 01:36:19,786
-B-O-Z-O.
-Sorry. l--

174
01:36:21,092 --> 01:36:22,923
You've never heard
of Bozo the Clown?

175
01:36:23,094 --> 01:36:24,459
No.

176
01:36:24,629 --> 01:36:28,065
-How could you not know?
-l don't know. l just don't.

177
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:31,733
How can you call yourself a clown
and not know who Bozo is?

178
01:36:31,903 --> 01:36:36,738
Hey, what are you hassling me for?
This is just a gig. lt's not my life.

179
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:38,770
l don't know who Bozo is.
ls he a clown?

180
01:36:38,943 --> 01:36:40,638
What, are you kidding me?

181
01:36:40,812 --> 01:36:42,780
-Well, what is he?
-Yes, he's a clown.

182
01:36:42,947 --> 01:36:46,212
All right. So, what's the big deal?
There's millions of clowns.

183
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:50,119
-All right, just forget it.
- Forget--? Me? You should forget it.

184
01:36:50,288 --> 01:36:53,519
You're living in the past, man.
You're hung up on some clown...

185
01:36:53,691 --> 01:36:56,319
-...from the '60s, man.
-All right.

186
01:36:56,661 --> 01:37:00,062
Very good, very good. All right,
go fold your balloon animals, Eric.

187
01:37:00,264 --> 01:37:03,597
Eric. What kind of name
is that for a clown, huh?

188
01:37:03,768 --> 01:37:07,363
Excuse me. You must be George.

189
01:37:07,572 --> 01:37:11,064
l'm Robin's mother.
You seem like...

190
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:16,043
-...such a lovely young man.
-Well, l do what l can.

191
01:37:16,214 --> 01:37:17,806
Hi, Ma. How's everything?

192
01:37:17,982 --> 01:37:22,180
This is just a wonderful party.

193
01:37:22,487 --> 01:37:24,216
The burgers should be ready
in a minute.

194
01:37:24,388 --> 01:37:26,117
Great, great.

195
01:37:27,792 --> 01:37:29,521
What's that smell?

196
01:37:30,161 --> 01:37:31,890
Smoke?

197
01:37:32,230 --> 01:37:33,720
Smoke.

198
01:37:33,898 --> 01:37:37,629
Everybody, l think l smell
some smoke back here.

199
01:37:38,202 --> 01:37:40,329
Fire! Get out of here!

200
01:37:40,505 --> 01:37:42,370
Get out of my way!

201
01:37:46,244 --> 01:37:49,270
-lt was an inferno in there!
-There he is. That's him!

202
01:37:49,881 --> 01:37:53,942
-That's the coward that left us to die.
-Let go.

203
01:38:03,161 --> 01:38:06,221
l was trying to lead the way.

204
01:38:06,397 --> 01:38:10,663
We needed a leader,
someone to lead the way to safety.

205
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:13,964
But you yelled, ''Get out of my way.''

206
01:38:14,839 --> 01:38:16,272
Because<i>....</i>

207
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:17,873
Because...

208
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:20,770
...as the leader, if l die...

209
01:38:21,012 --> 01:38:24,072
...then all hope is lost.

210
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:26,806
Who would lead? The clown?

211
01:38:28,352 --> 01:38:31,014
lnstead of castigating me,
you should be thanking me.

212
01:38:31,255 --> 01:38:34,554
What kind of topsy-turvy world
do we live in where heroes...

213
01:38:34,725 --> 01:38:37,990
...are cast as villains,
brave men as cowards?

214
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:40,562
But l saw you push the women
and children...

215
01:38:40,731 --> 01:38:42,790
...out of the way in a mad panic.

216
01:38:43,034 --> 01:38:45,662
l saw you knock them down.

217
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:49,295
And when you ran out,
you left everyone behind.

218
01:38:49,473 --> 01:38:53,136
Seemingly. Seemingly.
To the untrained eye...

219
01:38:53,311 --> 01:38:56,007
...l can fully understand
how you got that impression.

220
01:38:57,215 --> 01:39:01,413
What looked like pushing,
what looked like knocking down...

221
01:39:01,586 --> 01:39:04,384
...was a safety precaution.
ln a fire...

222
01:39:04,555 --> 01:39:07,854
...you stay close to the ground.
Am l right? Well--

223
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:12,826
And when l ran out that door,
l was not leaving anyone behind.

224
01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:16,693
Quite the contrary.
l risked my life...

225
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:19,803
...making sure that exit was clear.

226
01:39:21,739 --> 01:39:23,400
Any other questions?

227
01:39:24,108 --> 01:39:25,939
How do you live with yourself?

228
01:39:26,277 --> 01:39:27,744
lt's not easy.

229
01:39:30,982 --> 01:39:33,416
So she doesn't want
to see me anymore.

230
01:39:36,787 --> 01:39:40,120
Did you knock her over too
or just the kids?

231
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,425
No, her too.

232
01:39:45,663 --> 01:39:47,324
And her mother.

233
01:39:48,032 --> 01:39:49,659
-Really? Her mother?
-Yeah.

234
01:39:50,401 --> 01:39:53,029
l may have stepped
on her arm too.

235
01:39:54,138 --> 01:39:56,572
You probably couldn't see
because of the smoke.

236
01:39:56,741 --> 01:39:57,969
Yeah.

237
01:39:58,142 --> 01:40:00,076
But it was somebody's arm.

238
01:40:00,912 --> 01:40:04,279
So you feel ''women and children first''
in this day and age...

239
01:40:04,448 --> 01:40:06,609
...is somewhat
of an antiquated notion.

240
01:40:07,685 --> 01:40:08,913
To some degree, yeah.

241
01:40:09,086 --> 01:40:13,614
So basically, it's every man, woman,
child and invalid for themselves.

242
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:17,083
-ln a manner of speaking.
-Yeah.

243
01:40:17,428 --> 01:40:18,918
-Well, it's honest.
-Yeah.

244
01:40:19,096 --> 01:40:22,759
She should be commending me
for treating everyone like equals.

245
01:40:23,868 --> 01:40:26,393
Perhaps when she's released
from the burn center...

246
01:40:26,570 --> 01:40:28,470
...she'll see things differently.

247
01:40:30,908 --> 01:40:32,637
Perhaps.

248
01:40:33,744 --> 01:40:36,178
So, what was the fire,
just some greasy hamburgers?

249
01:40:36,347 --> 01:40:40,977
Yeah. Eric the clown
put it out with his big shoe.

250
01:40:46,023 --> 01:40:49,481
-By the way, did you see this?
-What's that?

251
01:40:50,061 --> 01:40:52,529
The Leonard Christian
article about my show.

252
01:40:52,697 --> 01:40:56,633
Plus my gig in Miami got canceled.
l bet you it's because of the article.

253
01:40:57,101 --> 01:41:00,434
He really does a number on you.
''Seinfeld froze like a deer...

254
01:41:00,604 --> 01:41:04,131
...in the headlights in the face
of incessant heckling.''

255
01:41:04,375 --> 01:41:07,208
l should've let her have it.
l held back because of Kramer.

256
01:41:07,545 --> 01:41:08,910
Know what you should do?

257
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:11,742
-Go to her office and heckle her.
-Right.

258
01:41:11,916 --> 01:41:15,647
All the comedians say, ''What if l came
to your work and heckled you?''

259
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:19,017
-Yeah, that'd be something.
-l'm not kidding. You should do it.

260
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:22,085
Wouldn't that be the ultimate
comedian's revenge?

261
01:41:22,259 --> 01:41:25,751
-l've always had a fantasy about that.
-Well, go ahead. Do it.

262
01:41:26,230 --> 01:41:28,061
-Why can't l?
-No reason.

263
01:41:28,566 --> 01:41:31,330
You know what?
l think l'm gonna do that.

264
01:41:31,502 --> 01:41:34,403
She came down to where l work.
l'll go down to where she works.

265
01:41:34,872 --> 01:41:38,467
-This is unprecedented.
-There's no precedent, baby.

266
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:43,146
What, you're using
my ''babies'' now?

267
01:41:47,385 --> 01:41:50,513
Hey, nice shoes.
Do you wear sandals to work?

268
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:53,589
lt's nice to walk into a room
and get the aroma of feet.

269
01:41:53,758 --> 01:41:55,658
Real conducive
to the work atmosphere.

270
01:41:55,826 --> 01:41:57,293
l'm sure your coworkers like it.

271
01:41:57,461 --> 01:41:59,622
''Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office.''

272
01:41:59,797 --> 01:42:02,857
''Great idea.
We can check on her bunions.''

273
01:42:03,134 --> 01:42:06,228
You know, l have work to do here.
l'm very busy.

274
01:42:06,404 --> 01:42:11,068
ls this disruptive? You find it hard
to work with someone interrupting?

275
01:42:11,342 --> 01:42:14,778
-How'd you like it if l called security?
-Security?

276
01:42:14,945 --> 01:42:18,676
l don't know how you'll make it
in this business if you can't take it.

277
01:42:18,883 --> 01:42:20,214
You got to be tough.

278
01:42:22,119 --> 01:42:24,986
You know-- All right. That's it.

279
01:42:25,156 --> 01:42:27,624
-Get out of my way.
-What's going on?

280
01:42:27,792 --> 01:42:29,521
What's happening here? Toby.

281
01:42:29,827 --> 01:42:31,454
Toby!

282
01:42:32,096 --> 01:42:35,156
-My pinkie toe.
-Toby!

283
01:42:39,437 --> 01:42:41,701
What did you go out there
to heckle her for?

284
01:42:41,906 --> 01:42:43,897
Because she came down the club
and heckled me.

285
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:45,770
l gave her a taste
of her own medicine.

286
01:42:45,943 --> 01:42:49,811
Oh, yeah! You gave her a taste
of medicine, all right.

287
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:53,507
-l didn't want her to have an accident.
-What accident?

288
01:42:53,684 --> 01:42:56,881
After he heckled Toby,
she ran out of the building...

289
01:42:57,054 --> 01:42:59,284
...and a street sweeper
ran over her foot...

290
01:42:59,457 --> 01:43:01,357
...and severed her pinkie toe.

291
01:43:01,926 --> 01:43:04,622
-That's unbelievable.
-Yeah. Then after the ambulance left...

292
01:43:04,795 --> 01:43:06,729
...l found the toe.

293
01:43:06,931 --> 01:43:10,992
l put it in a Cracker Jack box with ice
and took off for the hospital.

294
01:43:11,168 --> 01:43:13,796
-You ran?
-No. l jumped on the bus.

295
01:43:13,971 --> 01:43:16,496
l told the driver,
''l got a toe here, buddy. Step on it.''

296
01:43:17,908 --> 01:43:19,842
-Holy cow!
-Yeah, yeah.

297
01:43:20,077 --> 01:43:23,774
Then all of a sudden,
this guy pulls out a gun.

298
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:26,678
Well, l knew any delay's
gonna cost her her pinkie toe...

299
01:43:26,851 --> 01:43:29,843
...so l got up, and l started walking
towards him.

300
01:43:30,154 --> 01:43:32,850
He says, ''Where do you think
you're going, Cracker Jack?''

301
01:43:33,023 --> 01:43:35,787
l says, ''Well, l got a prize
for you, buddy.''

302
01:43:38,863 --> 01:43:41,297
-Knocked him out cold.
-How could you do that?

303
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:44,525
Then everybody is screaming
because the driver's passed out...

304
01:43:44,702 --> 01:43:48,297
...because of all the commotion.
The bus is out of control.

305
01:43:49,673 --> 01:43:52,267
So l grab him by the collar,
take him out of the seat...

306
01:43:52,443 --> 01:43:55,207
...get behind the wheel.
Now l'm driving the bus.

307
01:43:57,114 --> 01:43:59,674
-You're Batman.
-Yeah. l am Batman.

308
01:43:59,850 --> 01:44:02,842
Then the mugger, he comes to,
and he starts choking me.

309
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:04,885
So l'm fighting him off
with one hand...

310
01:44:05,055 --> 01:44:07,785
...and l kept driving the bus
with the other, you know?

311
01:44:07,958 --> 01:44:10,791
Then l managed to open the door
and kicked him out the door...

312
01:44:10,961 --> 01:44:13,088
...with my foot, you know,
at the next stop.

313
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:16,155
You kept making all the stops?

314
01:44:21,372 --> 01:44:23,169
Well, people kept ringing the bell!

315
01:44:27,578 --> 01:44:29,842
Well, what about the toe?
What happened to the toe?

316
01:44:30,014 --> 01:44:31,709
Well, l am happy to say...

317
01:44:31,882 --> 01:44:35,477
...the little guy's back in place
at the end of the line.

318
01:44:37,254 --> 01:44:40,883
You did all this for a pinkie toe?

319
01:44:41,559 --> 01:44:43,891
Well, it's a valuable appendage.

320
01:44:46,730 --> 01:44:51,133
So Kramer found the toe,
and they reattached it.

321
01:44:51,335 --> 01:44:53,803
-Really?
-Yeah. Poor kid.

322
01:44:53,971 --> 01:44:55,939
-What an ordeal.
-And you know...

323
01:44:56,106 --> 01:44:59,542
...how extremely sensitive she is.
She's gonna need our full support.

324
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:02,008
-Yeah, right.
-Look who's here.

325
01:45:02,246 --> 01:45:04,146
-Toby.
-Hey, it's Toby.

326
01:45:04,315 --> 01:45:07,148
Hi. How are you?
How are you feeling?

327
01:45:07,585 --> 01:45:09,746
-l'll be okay.
-Are you sure?

328
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,354
-l think so.
-Toby, what can l do?

329
01:45:12,523 --> 01:45:15,549
-Can l get you something?
-No, thank you.

330
01:45:15,726 --> 01:45:17,990
Toby, please let us help.
We're family.

331
01:45:18,162 --> 01:45:20,653
Well, l could use a cup of coffee.

332
01:45:21,899 --> 01:45:24,367
-She got the promotion?
-Yep.

333
01:45:24,568 --> 01:45:26,661
-Why?
-l'll tell you why.

334
01:45:26,837 --> 01:45:29,772
Because of her pinkie toe,
that's why.

335
01:45:30,007 --> 01:45:34,000
Because Lippman felt so sorry for her,
he didn't want to hurt her feelings.

336
01:45:34,178 --> 01:45:36,976
-Too bad.
-Sure, the pinkie toe is cute...

337
01:45:37,147 --> 01:45:39,843
...but l mean, what is it? lt's useless.

338
01:45:40,017 --> 01:45:44,613
lt does nothing. lt's got that little nail
that is just impossible to cut.

339
01:45:44,788 --> 01:45:46,483
-Why do we need it?
-That's the one...

340
01:45:46,657 --> 01:45:48,648
...that goes ''wee, wee, wee''
all the way home.

341
01:45:49,927 --> 01:45:52,418
-You just shut the--
-Elaine, did you hear the news?

342
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:55,190
-Toby got promoted.
-Yes, l heard, Kramer.

343
01:45:55,366 --> 01:45:58,563
-l work there, remember?
-You know what she told me?

344
01:45:58,736 --> 01:46:01,705
Her first order of business
is to put my coffee table book...

345
01:46:01,872 --> 01:46:04,272
...into the bookstores
as soon as possible.

346
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:07,001
-Oh, wonderful.
-Throughout this whole thing...

347
01:46:07,177 --> 01:46:11,341
-...she always kept smiling.
-Of course. She's deranged.

348
01:46:14,451 --> 01:46:17,249
l went down to the magazine,
pleaded with him to see me again.

349
01:46:17,421 --> 01:46:20,117
He agreed to come down tonight
and write another article.

350
01:46:20,491 --> 01:46:22,686
l heard you went down
to somebody's office...

351
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:24,794
-...and heckled them.
-Damn right.

352
01:46:24,962 --> 01:46:27,556
-We've been lap dogs long enough.
-How could you do that?

353
01:46:27,731 --> 01:46:29,323
Everybody's talking about it.

354
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:32,025
lt's about time one of us
drew a line in the sand.

355
01:46:32,269 --> 01:46:35,670
Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks.

356
01:46:36,740 --> 01:46:38,571
You opened the door for all of us.

357
01:46:38,742 --> 01:46:40,903
l can't wait
until somebody heckles me.

358
01:46:41,078 --> 01:46:43,308
-Well, it won't be long.
-Ladies and gentlemen...

359
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:46,176
-...please welcome Jerry Seinfeld.
-Got to go.

360
01:46:49,153 --> 01:46:50,643
Robin? Robin.

361
01:46:51,755 --> 01:46:54,451
-George, what is it? l'm working.
-Robin, listen to me.

362
01:46:54,625 --> 01:46:56,718
The most amazing thing
has happened.

363
01:46:56,894 --> 01:46:59,556
Kramer has opened my eyes.

364
01:46:59,797 --> 01:47:01,094
l think l've changed.

365
01:47:02,266 --> 01:47:03,995
-What are you talking about?
-Okay.

366
01:47:04,168 --> 01:47:06,068
l mean, Bozo the Clown.

367
01:47:06,270 --> 01:47:10,001
l mean, does he really need
''the Clown'' in his title?

368
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:12,267
As clown. Bozo the Clown.

369
01:47:12,710 --> 01:47:15,804
Are we gonna confuse him with Bozo
the district attorney?

370
01:47:16,013 --> 01:47:19,073
Bozo the pope?
There's no other Bozo.

371
01:47:19,416 --> 01:47:24,353
You'll see. Things will be different now
if you'll just give me one more chance.

372
01:47:24,655 --> 01:47:27,681
Listen, l got to think about this.

373
01:47:27,858 --> 01:47:32,352
-All right, but l'm serious about this.
-All right. Hand it over, man.

374
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:36,166
That's why men hunt
and women nest.

375
01:47:36,333 --> 01:47:38,767
He's got a gun! He's got a gun!

376
01:47:38,936 --> 01:47:40,198
Get out of the way!

377
01:47:48,379 --> 01:47:50,176
-George.
-What?

378
01:47:50,547 --> 01:47:54,381
-This is Ronnie Kaye.
-The prop comic?

379
01:47:56,587 --> 01:47:57,884
Hi. l didn't--

380
01:47:58,055 --> 01:48:01,320
l didn't recognize you.
What, did you--? You get a haircut?

381
01:48:01,492 --> 01:48:03,585
Nostrils.

382
01:48:04,428 --> 01:48:06,123
George?

383
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:08,497
Could l have a word?

384
01:48:17,574 --> 01:48:21,101
l was in a hotel, and the back of a door
in the hotel, they have that fire map.

385
01:48:21,278 --> 01:48:24,042
l'm flattered they think
l'll stand in a burning hotel room...

386
01:48:24,214 --> 01:48:25,704
...memorizing directions.

387
01:48:25,949 --> 01:48:29,817
l'll go left by the stair,
right by the candy machine.

388
01:48:30,154 --> 01:48:34,352
l'd probably get lost, have to go back
to the room, check the map again.

389
01:48:35,492 --> 01:48:40,054
They always tell you, whatever you do
in a hotel fire, do not panic.

390
01:48:40,264 --> 01:48:43,256
Hey, l've got four minutes to live.
l've never panicked in my life.

391
01:48:43,434 --> 01:48:45,095
lt's my option.

392
01:48:45,469 --> 01:48:47,960
Even if they find you,
you have a perfect excuse.

393
01:48:48,372 --> 01:48:50,567
They saved you
swinging from the shower curtain...

394
01:48:50,741 --> 01:48:53,642
...naked with the ice bucket
on your head. What happened?

395
01:48:53,977 --> 01:48:56,605
Well, l panicked.
That's understandable.
