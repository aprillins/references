1
00:00:02,635 --> 00:00:04,364
I'm going to get
a physical examination.

2
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:09,567
That urine sample. Giving them that,
that's always a pleasure, isn't it?

3
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,768
Then there's always
the amount question:

4
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:15,776
"l don't know what you need.
I gave you whatever I had there.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,648
I got more. Whatever you need,
I can get it for you.

6
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,686
Just let me know what you need.
It's no problem, I mean...."

7
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,723
But any kind of physical test,
I don't know what it is...

8
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,725
...I always click into this thing
where I wanna do really well.

9
00:00:28,895 --> 00:00:31,261
If it's gonna be a physical test,
I wanna do well.

10
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,399
Remember in school,
they'd do hearing tests?

11
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:36,330
And you'd really be listening,
you know...

12
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,604
...trying to really--
Trying to do well, I wanna do well.

13
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,638
I wanted to do unbelievable
on that test.

14
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,538
I wanted them to come to me
after the test and go:

15
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,942
"We think you may have something
close to super hearing.

16
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:52,948
What you heard was a cotton ball
touching a piece of felt.

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,684
We're sending the results
to Washington.

18
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,314
We'd like you
to meet the president."

19
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,062
Let me ask you a question.

20
00:01:08,668 --> 00:01:11,136
If you named a kid Rasputin...

21
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:14,740
...do you think that would have
a negative effect on his life?

22
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:16,804
No.

23
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,542
What are you doing?
We're going out to dinner.

24
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:23,078
Do you realize this is the last meal
I'm gonna have for three days?

25
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:26,947
-Yeah.
-George.

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,747
Come on up.

27
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:32,623
I never heard of this. You gotta fast
for three days to take an ulcer test.

28
00:01:32,792 --> 00:01:34,521
-How will you do that?
-I don't know.

29
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:39,358
How could I possibly have ulcers?
Who could have given me ulcers?

30
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:42,732
I think I'll take out the garbage.

31
00:01:43,169 --> 00:01:44,602
Have you ever fasted?

32
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,467
Well, once I didn't have
dinner till, like, 9:00.

33
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,365
I'll tell you, that was pretty rough.

34
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,609
Hey. Do me a favor, will you?

35
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,750
Throw out my garbage for me.

36
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:00,080
Yeah. Right.

37
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,788
Come on. It's just down the hall.

38
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,355
Give me 2 bucks.
I'll do it for 2 bucks.

39
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:10,724
I'll give you 50 cents.

40
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,195
There's no way I'd touch that bag
for less than $2.

41
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,665
Come on, 50 cents. You can
get yourself a Drake's Coffee Cake.

42
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:21,530
You're not getting no
Drake's Coffee Cake for 50 cents.

43
00:02:22,108 --> 00:02:25,202
I'm all set. I got the ticket. I'm going
to the Cayman lslands Friday.

44
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,506
I don't get you. Who goes
on vacation without a job?

45
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:31,309
What do you need, a break
from getting up at 1 1?

46
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:35,518
It's a deal. I don't know
why you don't come with me.

47
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:37,451
I don't go for nonrefundable deals.

48
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:40,752
I can't commit to a woman,
I'm not committing to an airline.

49
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:44,886
-Hi.
-Hi.

50
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,393
How are you?

51
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,329
Gina, do you know
Drake's Coffee Cake?

52
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:51,095
The plain cake with the sweet
brown crumbs on the top.

53
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:53,136
-Right. How much do they cost?
-The junior?

54
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,069
-No, no, no, the full-size.
-No, junior.

55
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:58,836
-You didn't say "junior."
-I haven't had one since I was little.

56
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,070
Really?

57
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:04,114
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I want you out of here.

58
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:10,481
-How you doing?
-Good enough.

59
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,919
-Boy, she's sexy, isn't she?
-Yeah.

60
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,135
-Do you believe that guy?
-What guy?

61
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,611
-My neighbor.
-That creepy guy?

62
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,149
-Did he think I was flirting with her?
-He didn't seem too pleased.

63
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,545
Maybe I'll get a steak
with French-fried onion rings.

64
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,719
Hey, you know what?

65
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,051
I just remembered something.

66
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,062
I had a dream about that guy
last night. This is amazing.

67
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,065
-Amazing? You've seen him before.
-I haven't seen him in months.

68
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,827
What was the dream?

69
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,962
He was doing standup comedy
in Kennebunkport, Maine...

70
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,404
...in this really ominous nightclub.

71
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,601
The stage was on a cliff
and the audience...

72
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,746
...was throwing all the comics off.

73
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,414
I think I've played there.

74
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,408
I've had a lot of paranormal stuff
happen to me.

75
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,781
You're a little paranormal.

76
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,353
Name one paranormal thing
that happened to you.

77
00:04:18,524 --> 00:04:21,425
-I knew I was gonna be bald.
-Your father's bald.

78
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,188
Baldness is inherited
from the mother's side, Jerry.

79
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:26,696
But your mother's bald too.

80
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,629
George, you know,
my friend goes to a psychic.

81
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,930
-Really?
-We should go sometime.

82
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,903
I'd love to go.
Make an appointment.

83
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:38,066
Psychics, vacations.
How about getting a job?

84
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,810
-I just got fired.
-All right. Let's get out of here.

85
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,315
I wonder what Gandhi ate
before his fast.

86
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,613
I heard he used to polish off
a box of Triscuits.

87
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:53,521
-Really?
-Oh, yeah. Gandhi loved Triscuits.

88
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,958
Who is it?

89
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,594
-Who is it?
-It's Gina!

90
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:03,133
-Who?
-Martin's girlfriend.

91
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,794
-Martin?
-Your next-door neighbor.

92
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:07,662
Oh, Martin!

93
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,401
It's Martin. I think he's dying.
He tried to kill himself with pills.

94
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,805
-What?
-Come on.

95
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,174
-Let me get my robe.
-We do not have time.

96
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:16,975
-Two seconds.
-There's no time.

97
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,311
-We don't have two seconds?
-All right, go ahead.

98
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,350
-No, forget it.
-No, go ahead.

99
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,648
-No, I'll just wear the pajamas.
-Just get it!

100
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,087
-Are you sure?
-Forget it. Come on.

101
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,420
No, I'll go get the robe.

102
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:37,032
It's not too bad. It's not
like a Sunny von Bulow coma.

103
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,632
Doctor said he should
snap out of it any time.

104
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,300
You know why he did this?
Because I told him it was over.

105
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,744
-I did not want to see him anymore.
-Really? It's over?

106
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:53,115
I could not stand it another minute.

107
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,879
Yesterday, he turned over
a hot dog stand...

108
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:57,955
...because he thought
the man looked at me.

109
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:03,088
Then, after he saw you in the hall....
He was crazy with jealousy.

110
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,491
Oh, boy.

111
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,929
Did he say anything about me?

112
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:11,329
He does not like you.

113
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:16,305
And all indications are he does not
like Drake's Coffee Cake.

114
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,608
-He said that?
-He was screaming about it all night.

115
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,113
How it's too sweet and
it falls apart when you eat it.

116
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:28,486
I'm sorry if I caused any trouble.
I was just being friendly.

117
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,851
I wasn't.

118
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,085
You weren't?

119
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,989
No. I have thought
about you many times.

120
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:42,290
-Have you thought about me?
-Of course.

121
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,638
Tell me everything.

122
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,631
Are you sure
he can't hear anything?

123
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,206
Martin.

124
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,976
Martin!

125
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,511
I wish he was not in a coma.
I wish he was dead.

126
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:04,422
I would like to pull the plug out
from him!

127
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,388
I would wait on that one.

128
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,755
I know how you feel,
but juries today...

129
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,523
...you never know how
they're gonna look at this.

130
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,869
I saw you looking at your watch.
You want to leave? Go ahead.

131
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,699
-I wanted to see what time it was.
-Are you afraid of him?

132
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,540
-No.
-Then kiss me.

133
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,369
-Here?
-Yes, right here.

134
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,245
Is this the proper venue?

135
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,873
-You don't want to?
-No, no, I want to.

136
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,314
I very much want to. I desire to.
I pine to.

137
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,181
Then kiss me right in front of him.

138
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,982
I can't! What if he wakes up?

139
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,990
A man is lying here unconscious
and you're afraid of him?

140
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,554
What kind of a man are you?

141
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,425
I'm a man who respects a good coma.

142
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,133
If it was one of those
in-and-out comas, maybe.

143
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:55,399
But when a guy's got a coma
going like this...

144
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,668
...you don't wanna mess with it.

145
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,738
-Hey.
-Hey.

146
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,510
-Did you hear about Martin?
-Yeah, I heard.

147
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:10,349
I can't believe he's in a coma.
He's got my vacuum cleaner.

148
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,658
I loaned it to him, he never
returned it. The carpets are filthy.

149
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,764
-What am I gonna do?
-Who told you about Martin?

150
00:08:19,932 --> 00:08:21,866
Newman.
He's good friends with him.

151
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,726
Bigmouth Newman.
I should have guessed.

152
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,835
He's got all my attachments,
you know.

153
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,866
Let me ask you something.
How long do you have to wait...

154
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:34,604
...for a guy to come out of a coma
before you ask his ex-girlfriend out?

155
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,508
Oh, Gina?

156
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:40,377
Why wait?
Why not just call Dr. Kevorkian.

157
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,148
I don't get that
whole suicide machine.

158
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:48,122
There's no tall buildings
where these people live?

159
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:52,229
They can't wrap their lips around
a revolver like a normal person?

160
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,860
What's going on
between you and Gina?

161
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,535
Well, I went with her
to the hospital last night.

162
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:02,399
So we're in the room and she's trying
to get me to kiss her in front of him.

163
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,873
That's the great thing
about Mediterranean women.

164
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,636
All right. So, what did you do?

165
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:12,045
-Nothing.
-What kind of a man are you?

166
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,118
The guy is unconscious, in a coma...

167
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,687
...and you don't have the guts
to kiss his girlfriend?

168
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,447
I didn't know what
the coma etiquette was.

169
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,490
There is no coma etiquette.

170
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:25,392
See, that's the beauty of the coma.
It doesn't matter what you do.

171
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:31,565
So you're saying his girl, his car,
his clothes, it's all up for grabs.

172
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,839
You can just loot the coma victim.

173
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,338
I give them 24 hours to get out of it.

174
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,105
They can't get out of it
by 24 hours, it's a land rush.

175
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:45,573
So if the coma victim wakes up
in a month...

176
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,981
...he's thrilled. He got out of the coma.

177
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,952
-He goes home, there's nothing left?
-Nothing left!

178
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:57,895
That's why I'm trying to get that
vacuum. Somebody's gonna grab it.

179
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:06,199
Martin's spirit came to you
as a warning.

180
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,872
Why would he come to George?

181
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,634
Because George has heightened
extrasensory perception.

182
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,607
Faithy, get your finger
out of your nose!

183
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,839
-I knew it. I always felt different.
-You are. Some coffee cake?

184
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,081
-Drake's?
-Yes.

185
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:22,311
-Did you buy this for me?
-No, why?

186
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,722
Because I love Drake's Coffee Cake.

187
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,826
-Maybe I did.
-Take it away.

188
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:31,054
She hasn't eaten in two days.

189
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,563
-Who's Pauline?
-Pauline?

190
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,992
Wait a minute. Oh, my God.

191
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,332
My brother once impregnated
a woman named Pauline.

192
00:10:40,506 --> 00:10:42,633
-You think about her?
-When I hear her name.

193
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,508
Cut these with your left hand.

194
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,807
There was a woman. Audrey.

195
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,987
She had a very big nose.

196
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,886
I see an Audrey,
but with a small nose.

197
00:10:58,057 --> 00:11:00,855
Yes, yes. She had a nose job.

198
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,618
I loved her very deeply.

199
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,263
Will she ever speak to me again?

200
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,661
Not in this life.

201
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:11,431
-Should you be smoking?
-Does it bother you?

202
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:13,002
-You're pregnant.
-Elaine.

203
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,871
I smoked when I had Faithy.

204
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,005
What? What?

205
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:21,203
I don't know about this trip, George.

206
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,143
You can see the Cayman lslands
in there?

207
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,279
Is something gonna happen
to me? What?

208
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:27,885
It's really bad for the fetus,
you know that?

209
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:30,249
She's a psychic.
She knows how the kid's gonna be.

210
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,017
Should I not go on this trip?

211
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,849
George...

212
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:39,631
...I am going to tell you something
and I want you to really hear me.

213
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,497
Now, listen, I just don't know
how a person, with everything...

214
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:49,369
...we now know about prenatal care,
can put a cigarette in her mouth!

215
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,405
-What are you doing?
-It's disgusting.

216
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,442
-I don't need this!
-Look, please!

217
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,546
-I would like you both to leave.
-Oh, fine.

218
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,979
Well, I don't like to be around people
who are just so irresponsible.

219
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:02,609
-Get the hell out.
-A plane crash?! A heart attack?!

220
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,150
Lupus? Is it lupus?

221
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:08,089
Do you want me to call the super?
He was an lsraeli commando.

222
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,656
If you don't say anything,
I'll assume it's a plane crash.

223
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,433
-Get out.
-Not a plane crash.

224
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,463
Is it a plane crash?

225
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,073
Psychics should be licensed.

226
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,506
And it wouldn't be hard. We could
just give them the regular DMV test...

227
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,943
...only with the silver dollars and
the pizza dough over the eyes.

228
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:32,311
If you can do the parallel park
like that, you're a psychic.

229
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,953
We can test these people,
no question about it.

230
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,056
Like Kreskin. Instead
of just hiding his check...

231
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:41,284
...why don't we try
stopping his check.

232
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,724
Let's see how he handles that.

233
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,223
I do not like your toothbrush.

234
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,594
There are no bristles.

235
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,596
You can say what you want
about me...

236
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,102
...but I'll be damned
if I'm gonna stand here...

237
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,606
...while you insult my toothbrush.

238
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:02,473
It is too small for someone
with such a big mouth.

239
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,084
Let me ask you...

240
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,386
...what will you do if Martin
wakes up? Run away like a mouse?

241
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,152
No, more like the Three Stooges
at the end of every movie.

242
00:13:17,396 --> 00:13:19,125
Who are these stooges
you speak of?

243
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,726
They're a comedy team.

244
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,034
Tell me about them. Everything.

245
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:30,174
Well, they're three funny-looking guys
and they'd hit each other a lot.

246
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,579
-You will show me the stooges?
-I will show you the stooges.

247
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,411
-When?
-Well...

248
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,378
...I don't really know where
the stooges are right now...

249
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:44,455
...but if I locate them,
you'll be the first to know.

250
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,584
Come. You walk me to a cab.

251
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:51,123
Well, l....

252
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:53,661
I don't want you to get upset
or anything...

253
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,530
...but with Martin and all, maybe it's
not a good idea to be seen together...

254
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,001
...in the building,
because he had a lot of friends.

255
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,536
You are still afraid.
You are not a man.

256
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:06,574
Well, then what are all those ties and
sports jackets doing in my closet?

257
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:09,244
Are you going to walk me
to a cab or not?

258
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,683
Yeah, all right, all right.

259
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,182
-Why don't you just eat fruit.
-Fruit makes me incontinent.

260
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,884
I don't want you eating over here.

261
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:26,093
Hello, Gina. Hello, Jerry.

262
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:28,723
Hello, Newman.

263
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,773
Do you think Newman
would tell Martin if he wakes up?

264
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:43,415
What kind of sicko would do that?
He could kill me.

265
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,345
People smoke, Elaine.

266
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,581
My mother smoked.

267
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,254
It didn't hurt me.

268
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:54,682
Did you guys see that wall move?

269
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,155
Boy, it's a good thing we came.

270
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:00,761
Could there be a native problem
in the Caymans?

271
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:02,298
Maybe there's native unrest.

272
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,995
Hi. I haven't eaten in three days.

273
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:10,001
I was wondering how much longer
it would be till I get my X-ray.

274
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,638
We'll call you.

275
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:15,777
George, I want you to promise me
something. If I'm ever in a coma...

276
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:20,510
...in the first 24 hours, get everything
out of my place and put it in storage.

277
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,254
-How come?
-Looters.

278
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:28,354
How do we know the dog food's
any good?

279
00:15:30,829 --> 00:15:33,161
Who tastes it?

280
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,629
She is really hungry.

281
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:38,636
-Hey.
-Kramer.

282
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,999
Well, Newman's upstairs
visiting Martin.

283
00:15:44,343 --> 00:15:46,106
Would you buy
my Cayman lsland ticket?

284
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,570
-You're not going?
-No.

285
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:50,374
-Why not?
-The psychic said...

286
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:52,106
...something terrible will happen.

287
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,511
I dig.

288
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,787
I want my vacuum cleaner!

289
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,588
Martin, I know you can hear me.

290
00:16:03,762 --> 00:16:07,493
Look, my mother's coming to visit me.
She sees that rug, she's gonna kill me.

291
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:11,158
He can't hear you, you idiot.
Why don't you just buy another one.

292
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,665
Why would I buy another one when
I spent 100 bucks on this one?

293
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:18,032
I have a carpet sweeper
you can use.

294
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,543
I don't want a carpet sweeper.
They don't do anything.

295
00:16:21,714 --> 00:16:23,181
It gets my rug clean.

296
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,976
The carpet sweeper
is the biggest scam...

297
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,848
...perpetrated on the American
public since One Hour Martinizing.

298
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,751
You should take a look
at my rug, then.

299
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,222
I wouldn't set foot in your house.

300
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:37,859
-Hello.
-Hey.

301
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,827
Hello, Jerry.

302
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,500
-How's he doing?
-Well, he looks happy to me.

303
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:49,198
I hope he stays this happy
when he wakes up.

304
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,105
-Why wouldn't he?
-No reason.

305
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:55,172
He'll have a lot of catching up
to do, I guess.

306
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,742
I'll bring him up to date.

307
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,708
-How up to date?
-All the way up.

308
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:04,681
Nothing could change your mind?

309
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:10,052
Well, it would take a lot, because
a friend is something you earn.

310
00:17:10,462 --> 00:17:14,762
Jerry has a friend who has free tickets
to the Cayman lslands this weekend.

311
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,195
He's not going.

312
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,805
I don't care much for the beach.
I freckle.

313
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:28,746
-ls that a...?
-Drake's Coffee Cake.

314
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:33,682
Where did you get that?

315
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,149
From my house.
I got a whole box of them.

316
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,655
Boy. That's the full-size.

317
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,552
That's your big boy.

318
00:17:46,365 --> 00:17:48,128
Can I have a bite?

319
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,528
I don't like to give out bites.

320
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:52,760
I got another one...

321
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,736
...but I'm saving it for later.

322
00:17:56,975 --> 00:17:58,772
Just one bite?

323
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,607
I don't think so.
You know, they're so fragile.

324
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,511
All right! All right.

325
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,180
I won't say anything.

326
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:09,411
-You swear?
-I swear.

327
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:12,648
-On your mother's life?
-On my mother's life.

328
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,996
But here it was...

329
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,738
...mountains of duck.

330
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:36,703
And not fatty duck either,
but juicy, tender breasts of duck.

331
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,816
-Beautifully sliced....
-Faithy!

332
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,474
Sweetheart, no, don't run!

333
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,620
You could take
as much as you want....

334
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,656
Sweetheart! Sweetheart! Faithy!

335
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:56,132
Hi. Hi! What are you doing here?
How did I know you were here?

336
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,997
Something drew me here.
This is phenomenal.

337
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,536
The nurse said she'd be back.

338
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:02,503
Supposed to take me
to the delivery room.

339
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:05,006
Oh, that's great. That's great.

340
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,010
I have to apologize for my friend
the other day--

341
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,307
Friend? I don't even
know that woman.

342
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,814
I met her on the way over.
I couldn't get rid of her.

343
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,317
I tell you, my psychic instincts
were a little off--

344
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:19,482
-Where's the nurse?
-I'm sure she'll be right back.

345
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,525
Sweetheart, why don't you
run and get a nurse for Mommy.

346
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:26,221
I was just curious. The other day
you said something about my trip.

347
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,496
-Don't take that trip.
-Yeah! Why? Why?

348
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,795
-Because.... Because....
-All right, Rula. It's time to go.

349
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,371
Yeah, because...? Because...?

350
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,502
Assassins! How dare they keep
a person waiting like this!

351
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:43,680
Drake's Coffee Cake?

352
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,143
-Give me that!
-Jerry, you better stop her or I'll tell!

353
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:50,288
Elaine, no! No!

354
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:57,418
Are there terrorists on the plane?
A hotel fire, is that it?

355
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:01,555
Typhus? Malaria? Yellow fever?
Lupus? Is it lupus?

356
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,497
They did it right in this bed, Martin.
Right in front of you.

357
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:07,332
-I want my vacuum cleaner!
-I can explain!

358
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,474
It was disgusting!

359
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,678
What are you doing?
We're going to dinner in 10 minutes.

360
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,312
I never assisted in a birth before.

361
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,414
It's really quite disgusting.

362
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,447
-What did she name the kid?
-You wouldn't believe it.

363
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,923
Rasputin.

364
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,827
-Hey!
-Hey!

365
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,398
-When did you get back?
-A couple hours ago.

366
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:39,162
-So how was it?
-George...

367
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:44,234
...I would like to thank you
for the greatest four days of my life.

368
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:48,904
They were shooting the
Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue...

369
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,608
...right in the hotel pool.
Not only that...

370
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,582
...the hotel opened up an area
on the beach for nude bathing...

371
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,914
...and all of the models
went down there.

372
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:02,559
I am on the next blanket
from Elle Macpherson.

373
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,289
We played backgammon nude.

374
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:09,357
-Oh, she's a sweet kid.
-Nude backgammon...

375
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,002
...with swimsuit models!

376
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,970
Oh, you know what? The second day
I was there, I stepped on a jellyfish.

377
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:21,443
It stung my foot. That's probably what
Rula was trying to warn you about.

378
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,808
-You gotta watch for the jellyfish.
-Yeah.

379
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,212
What's this?

380
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,821
It's an invitation to a housewarming
for Martin and Gina.

381
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,114
-They moved in together?
-Yeah, some place in the Village.

382
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:38,493
-Yeah.
-It's Elaine.

383
00:21:38,664 --> 00:21:40,723
All right, we're coming down.

384
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:43,060
-Where you going?
-We're taking Elaine to dinner.

385
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,068
She's gotta start the fast again.
You wanna go?

386
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:49,398
I'd like to, but a bunch of us
from the islands are getting together.

387
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:53,035
-Elle Macpherson gonna be there?
-I gotta call her back.

388
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,777
The thing I don't understand
about the suicide person...

389
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:01,952
...is the people that try
and commit suicide...

390
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,921
...for some reason, they don't die,
and then that's it. They stop trying.

391
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,916
Why?

392
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:12,495
Why don't they just keep trying?
What has changed? Is their life better?

393
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,990
No. In fact, it's worse,
because now they've found out...

394
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,035
...here's one more thing you stink at.

395
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,671
That's why these people don't
succeed at life to begin with.

396
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,902
Because they give up too easy.
I say pills don't work, try a rope.

397
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:32,649
Car won't start in the garage?
Get a tune-up. You know what I mean?

398
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,410
There's nothing more rewarding...

399
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,487
...than reaching a goal
you've set for yourself.



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
