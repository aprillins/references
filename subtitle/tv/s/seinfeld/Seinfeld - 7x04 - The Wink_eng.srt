1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,357
Every morning, when you wake up,
it's like you're born all over again.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,916
You can't see, you can't talk.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,152
You're on your way to the bathroom
trying to remember, "How do I walk?"

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,833
Like you've never
been alive before.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,673
But if any invention marks
the decline of human civilization...

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,558
...it would have to be
the snooze alarm.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,392
The snooze alarm
is based on the idea...

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,313
...that when the alarm goes off,
you are not getting up.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,914
You're not even awake,
you're already a failure.

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,992
They should sell the snooze alarm
with an unemployment application...

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,434
...and a bottle of tequila.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,070
Just make it a complete
pathetic-loser kit.

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,115
- Hello.
- This is your wak e-up service.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,669
It's 7.15.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,115
Oh, God.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,670
Oh, I could use
a few more hours sleep.

17
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,957
- Hot date last night?
- I wish.

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,758
A woman with a sexy v oice
lik e yours...

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,559
...it's hard to believe
you're waking up alone.

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,438
Really?

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,794
Thank you...

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,635
...Tri-State Wake-Up Service
person.

23
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,271
- Call me James.
- Oh, all right, James.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,872
The wake-up guy asked you out?

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,189
Yeah, I've never seen him...

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,557
...but I feel like we have
this weirdly intimate relationship.

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,870
You know, I mean, I'm lying in bed.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,837
I'm wearing my nightie.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,319
I don't know. A blind date?

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,519
You wanna go out with
my cousin Holly. You've never met her.

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,272
Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,998
At least I've spoken to my guy.

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,390
You're going out on a deaf date.

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,915
I think I'd rather go on a deaf date
than a blind date.

35
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,038
The question is, would you rather
date the blind or the deaf?

36
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,236
- Now, you're off on a topic.
- That's interesting.

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,392
See, now, I think
I would rather date the deaf.

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,754
Because I think the blind...

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,309
...would probably be
a little messy around the house.

40
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,552
I mean, let's face it,
they're not gonna get all the crumbs.

41
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,756
You're constantly
walking around with a sponge.

42
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:05,029
See, I disagree.
I would rather date the blind.

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,670
You know, you could let the house go,
you let yourself go.

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,554
A good-looking blind woman...

45
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,790
...doesn't know
you're not good enough for her.

46
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,190
I think she'd figure it out
soon enough.

47
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,833
What?

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,479
What is this?

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,200
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,238
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit?
What are you turning into?

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,356
A healthy person.

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,595
- You squirted me.
- Oh, sorry.

53
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,830
Boy, that stings.

54
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,910
George, have you seen Morgan?

55
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,436
- No.
- He's been coming in later and later.

56
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,229
- Is there something wrong?
- No, not that I know of.

57
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,918
Really?

58
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,354
Well, make sure he signs this.

59
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,193
George, if there's a problem
with Morgan, you can tell me.

60
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,828
Morgan? No, he's doing a great job.

61
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,919
I understand.

62
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,909
I still can't believe
you're going out on a blind date.

63
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,389
I'm not worried.
He sounds like he's good-looking.

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,073
You're going by sound?
What are we, whales?

65
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,314
I think I can tell.

66
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,550
What percentage of people
are good-looking?

67
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,234
- Twenty-five percent.
- Twenty-five percent?

68
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,834
No way. It's like 4 to 6 percent.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,319
It's a 20-1 shot.

70
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,118
- You're way off.
- Way off?

71
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,829
You been to the Motor Vehicle Bureau?
It's a leper colony down there.

72
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,477
So basically, what you're saying...

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,949
...is 95 percent of the population
is undateable?

74
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,758
Undateable.

75
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,876
Then how are all these people
getting together?

76
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,553
Alcohol.

77
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,194
What is your problem?

78
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,396
No problem here.

79
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,835
You keep winking at me.
That's really obnoxious.

80
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,433
- I had no idea.
- Right there. You just did it again.

81
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,388
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

82
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,630
It's from that grapefruit
Jerry squirted at me.

83
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,119
Oh, your eye still hurts?

84
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,750
Yeah, yeah, you must have squirted
a piece of pulp in it too.

85
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,558
Pulp couldn't make it
across the table.

86
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,836
Pulp can move, baby.

87
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,833
Why can't you eat a real breakfast?

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,719
I eat healthy. If I have to take out
an eye, that's the breaks.

89
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,234
Wait a minute. I must have
been winking down at the office.

90
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,755
That's why Mr. Wilhelm
was acting so misterioso.

91
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,793
What did he think,
you were flirting with him?

92
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,035
No, he thought I was hiding
something about Morgan.

93
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,556
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Jughead.

94
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,030
Hello, Archie, Veronica,
Mr. Weatherbee.

95
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,599
Hey.

96
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,230
- Is this Don Mattingly's signature?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,594
And Buck Showalter's?

98
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,036
It's an interoffice envelope. It gets
passed around all over the office.

99
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,872
Hey, can I show this
to my buddy Stubs?

100
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,553
He runs a sports-memorabilia store.

101
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,392
He'll pay top-dollar
for pro autographs.

102
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,839
Yeah, like I'm gonna risk my job
with the New York Yankees...

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,513
...to make a few extra bucks.

104
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,033
No, of course not.

105
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,549
No, you see, Don Mattingly
signed this envelope.

106
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,517
Then he sent it to room 318...

107
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,956
...where it was received and signed for
by manager Buck Showalter.

108
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,111
I don't know. An envelope?

109
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,998
- It doesn't really cut it.
- Why?

110
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,038
And what is this?

111
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,156
A birthday card.

112
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,596
Signed by the entire
Yankee organization?

113
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,718
This could be worth something.

114
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,590
- Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?
- Hello.

115
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,318
You got that birthday card?

116
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,073
- Birthday card?
- Mr. Steinbrenner's birthday card.

117
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,037
Wilhelm said you'd have it
for me to sign.

118
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,079
Oh, yeah. I'll have that for you
right after lunch.

119
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,789
- Fine. I'll be back after my massage.
- Of course, your massage.

120
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,110
Enjoy your massage.

121
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,112
- Hello?
- Elaine?

122
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,870
- James.
- Yes.

123
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,831
Hello.

124
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,271
I can't believe Elaine's
never taken you here.

125
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,112
I'm really not
much of a meat eater.

126
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,995
You don't eat meat?

127
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,594
- What are you, one of those...?
- No, I'm not one of those.

128
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,674
When we were little girls...

129
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,434
...Grandma Mema would take us
to a matinee and dinner here.

130
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,478
- Grandma Mema?
- Elaine must have mentioned Mema.

131
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,471
No, I think I would have
remembered Mema.

132
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,234
Oh, well, that's typical.
Elaine never liked Grandma Mema.

133
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,834
Ready?

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,197
I'll have the porterhouse, medium rare,
baked potato with sour cream.

135
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,472
What do you recommended
besides a steak?

136
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,392
The lamb chops are good.

137
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,552
Anything lighter?
How do you prepare the chicken?

138
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,871
It's a full bird, stuffed with ham,
topped with Gorgonzola.

139
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,759
You know, I'll just have a salad.

140
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,592
Thank you.

141
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,239
Just a salad.

142
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,879
Just a salad.

143
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,393
Just a salad.

144
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,152
Here you are. Hey, boys.

145
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,958
Hey, you. Hey, you. Hi.

146
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,154
These are your dogs?

147
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,595
Yeah, when you live alone,
your dogs are all you have.

148
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,478
Do you like dogs?

149
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,074
Shut up, you stupid little mutt!

150
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,998
- Dogs? Oh, I love dogs.
- Boys, this is Elaine.

151
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,629
I'm sorry.
They're usually very friendly.

152
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,199
Hey.

153
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,870
Hey, Mr. Morgan,
how was your massage?

154
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,873
I had to cancel it. For some reason
my wife got it into her head...

155
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,712
...that it was more
than just a massage.

156
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,749
- Really?
- We got into this big fight at lunch.

157
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,514
- I'll be sleeping on the couch.
- Listen, don't oversleep.

158
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,557
- You can't afford to be late again.
- I know.

159
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,429
Somebody's been giving Wilhelm
the impression I've been slacking off.

160
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,753
Hey, you know, you should try
my friend's wake-up service.

161
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,273
She's swears by this thing.

162
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,112
You may be my only friend
around here.

163
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,317
- By the way, you got that card?
- Not yet.

164
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,675
Make sure Steinbrenner
doesn't get it till I sign it.

165
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,829
Yes, sir.

166
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,792
I mean, I just don't understand it.

167
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,758
As soon as I met these dogs,
they started growling at me.

168
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,833
Well, maybe his dogs heard about
how you tried to kidnap that other dog.

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,389
These mutts like to gossip.

170
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,794
So have you talked to Holly?

171
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,273
Did she mention our lunch?

172
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,469
- Kind of.
- Well, what do you mean, "Kind of"?

173
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,273
I mean, she thought it was
kind of strange to just order a salad.

174
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,150
You know, for a man.

175
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,236
Like a quiche thing?

176
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,632
You're in the ballpark.

177
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,313
Salad? What was I thinking?

178
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,152
Women don't respect salad eaters.

179
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,912
You got that right.

180
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,640
You're going over there
for dinner tonight, right?

181
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,793
- What is she making?
- I don't know. I'm sure it had parents.

182
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,478
Call her up.
She won't mind if you come.

183
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,030
Oh, don't worry, I'll be there.
And I'll be packing an artery.

184
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,917
Well, Mr. Weatherbee.

185
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,159
Do you have
that Yankee envelope?

186
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,033
I sure do.

187
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,273
- There you are.
- Hey.

188
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,113
Think you're gonna be very pleased
when you see what's inside.

189
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,430
- What is this?
- Your cut of the loot.

190
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,794
Stubs gave me $200...

191
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,269
...for the autographed birthday card
that was inside.

192
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,953
Who told you to sell the card?

193
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,994
- You did.
- No, I didn't.

194
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,388
Well, not in so many words...

195
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,074
...but I believe
we had an understanding.

196
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,798
I was not winking, you idiot.

197
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,916
That was the grapefruit.
It's like acid.

198
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,878
I need that card back.
It's Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.

199
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,998
Well, Stubs sold it to some guy
whose kid is in the hospital.

200
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,958
Well, get it back.
It's very important.

201
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,152
Look, you want me
to get it back or not?

202
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,069
Get it back!

203
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,112
This is such a lovely
table setting, Holly.

204
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,919
- Where did you get these napkins?
- They were Grandma Mema's.

205
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,232
- I don't remember them.
- You wouldn't.

206
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,914
She only used them
on special occasions.

207
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,600
Special occasions? It wasn't special
when my family visited?

208
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,320
Everybody like mutton?

209
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,752
Mutton.

210
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,909
Hope you didn't cut the fat off.

211
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,350
- Are you Bobby?
- Yes.

212
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,917
Well, I heard that you have
a very special birthday card...

213
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,150
...with all the Yankee
autographs on it.

214
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,551
- Sure do, mister.
- Oh, boy. Yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah.

215
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,915
Boy, Stubs sure went to town
with this thing, huh?

216
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,275
Yeah, well, Bobby,
what if I told you...

217
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,874
...that a very important person
at the New York Yankees...

218
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,268
...needed this card back?

219
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,115
Oh, no. I'd never part with this card
for anything in the world.

220
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,794
Well, Bobby...

221
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,354
- Who's your favourite Yankee?
- Paul O'Neill.

222
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,432
What if I get Paul O'Neill
to hit a home run just for you?

223
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,797
- Really? Paul O'Neill would do that?
- For you, he would.

224
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,632
Could he hit two home runs?

225
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,233
Two?

226
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,278
Sure, kid. But then you gotta promise
you'll do something for me.

227
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,398
I know. Get out of this bed one day
and walk again.

228
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,949
Yeah, that would be nice,
but I just need the card.

229
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,874
What about this candelabra?

230
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,792
That was Grandma Mema's also.

231
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,951
She bought it on her trip to Europe
in 1926.

232
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,877
Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton.
I was afraid you only ate salad.

233
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,318
Hey, salad's got nothing
on this mutton.

234
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,077
That is so funny.
Did you just make that up?

235
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,832
I wish I could take credit for it.

236
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,595
It's actually a line my butcher uses
when we're chewing the fat.

237
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,751
How about that beautiful desk
over there?

238
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,799
Yeah, that was in Mema's study.

239
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,712
I love that desk.

240
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,110
What did you do,
ransack the place after she died?

241
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,510
This is some fine mutton.

242
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,591
You know what?
I'm getting out of here.

243
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,553
Can I borrow your jacket?

244
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,950
- Well, the thing is...
- It's cold out, okay?

245
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,838
I didn't bring my own, okay? Jerry.

246
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,592
Jerry!

247
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,671
God forbid I should
borrow one from Holly.

248
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,070
It might have belonged
to Grandma Mema.

249
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,113
Thanks for mutton.

250
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,395
Nice doggy.

251
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,879
I'm a nice person.

252
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,359
Don't believe what you hear.

253
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,274
I love dogs. I really do.

254
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,514
- Where are the napkins?
- What?

255
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,752
Grandma Mema's napkins.
Two are missing.

256
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,234
Elaine took them, didn't she?

257
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,671
I don't know about that.

258
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,593
- Have you got any floss?
- You heard her. She coveted them.

259
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,671
I bet she took them just to spite me.

260
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,910
She's probably having a laugh
about it right now.

261
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,837
Down, doggy!

262
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,438
What are you doing
in this neighbourhood?

263
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,955
- Did you hide the dogs?
- Yeah, they're in the kitchen.

264
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,275
It's okay. Okay. Quiet!

265
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,674
- What's going on?
- Oh, God.

266
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,068
These dogs were chasing me.

267
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,389
And no cabs were stopping.

268
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,028
I had to get off the street.
I remembered you lived here.

269
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,553
Why were dogs chasing you?

270
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,915
They just don't like me.
It's a long story.

271
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,435
I can tell you about it someday,
but not right now.

272
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,475
I would ask you to stay, but I only have
the sofa bed, and it's where I sleep.

273
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,351
Well, we'll have to sleep
head-to-toe.

274
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,750
- Head-to-toe?
- Head-to-toe.

275
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,630
Hey, wake up.

276
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,993
It's 8:30. You were supposed
to wake me up at 7: 15.

277
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,835
I'm sorry. I didn't get any sleep.
You kept kicking me in the face.

278
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,150
You're a wake-up guy.
Don't you have calls to make?

279
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,470
I'll make them later.

280
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,232
- Have you seen Morgan?
- He's not here?

281
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,594
No, he's late again.

282
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,716
That's impossible.
I got him a wake-up service.

283
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,359
You don't have to cover for him.

284
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,635
He's gonna be gone soon...

285
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,234
...and I'm gonna recommended you
for his job.

286
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,674
Gone?

287
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,270
Sounds like all that winking
got you a promotion.

288
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't want Morgan's job.
He's got a lot of work to do.

289
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,674
Hey, Elaine, your friend
never woke up Mr. Morgan.

290
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,956
Yeah, well, he was tired.
He had feet in his face.

291
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,794
My cousin Holly
is completely insane.

292
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,157
She keeps calling and accusing me
of stealing her napkins.

293
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,072
- Napkins?
- I mean, why?

294
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,992
Why would I take
her stupid napkins?

295
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,038
Because they were in the pockets
of my jacket.

296
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,394
- They were?
- Yes.

297
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,154
I was using them
to spit out the mutton.

298
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,398
You spit it out?

299
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,791
I had dogs chasing me for that.

300
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,080
I was almost mauled
because of that mutton.

301
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,958
- What exactly is mutton?
- I don't know.

302
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,156
And I didn't wanna find out.

303
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,753
So where's my jacket?

304
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,959
I must have left it at James'.

305
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,350
Spent the night at James', did we?

306
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,239
Yeah, but we reversed positions,
so there was no funny business.

307
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,077
- Reversed positions?
- Yeah, you know, head-to-toe.

308
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,030
So what?
Your genitals are still lined up.

309
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,834
No, because I slept
with my back to him.

310
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,468
- Mr. O'Neill?
- Yeah.

311
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,392
Yeah, look, you don't know me.

312
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,471
All right. I can give you
an autograph here...

313
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,679
...but my pen's kind of screwed up and
you'll probably only get, like, half a P.

314
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,035
No, it's not that.
It's about a boy in the hospital.

315
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,919
I was wondering if you could
do something to lift his spirits.

316
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,152
- I can help you there.
- I promised you'd hit two home runs.

317
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,675
- You what?
- Yeah, you know, a couple of dingers.

318
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,434
You promised a kid in the hospital
I'd hit two home runs?

319
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,909
- Yeah, what? No good?
- No, it's no good. It's terrible.

320
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,559
You don't hit home runs like that.

321
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,075
It's hard to hit home runs.
Where did you get two from?

322
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,071
Well, two is better than one.

323
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,470
That's ridiculous.
I'm not a home-run hitter.

324
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,710
- Well, Babe Ruth did it.
- He did not.

325
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,632
You're saying
that Babe Ruth was a liar?

326
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,917
I'm not calling him a liar, but he wasn't
stupid enough to promise two.

327
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,230
Well, maybe I did
overextend myself.

328
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,992
How did you get in here anyway?

329
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,429
Oh, hi, Elaine. You know, I lost
all of my 6:30 clients because of you.

330
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,751
Yeah, well, why did you
have to stick your feet in my face?

331
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,959
Yes, I have the jacket. Hold on.

332
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,159
Fellas.

333
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,153
What do you got?

334
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,837
The Yank ees tak e the field
on a beautiful afternoon.

335
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,036
It's hot in here.

336
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,794
Hey, Bobby,
can I have some of your juice?

337
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,590
After Paul O'Neill
hits his first home run.

338
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,519
- Yeah?
- It's Holly.

339
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,151
- Come on up.
- And the two-and-one pitch to O'Neill.

340
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,630
Towering shot to deep right field,
and it's gone!

341
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,513
- Yeah!
- A home run for Paul O'Neill.

342
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,116
- The Yanks lead 1-nothing.
- Oh, yeah!

343
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,032
All right.

344
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,428
Yeah.

345
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,188
One more to go.

346
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,317
Hey, what's all this?

347
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,710
I decided I'm gonna
make you dinner.

348
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,359
Oh, I thought we were going out.

349
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,078
After you scarfed up my mutton...

350
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,913
...I had the irresistible urge
to make pork chops for you.

351
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,272
Well, I said hello to Franco for you.

352
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,549
- Franco?
- Your butcher down the street.

353
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,036
I bet he acted all aloof
like he didn't know me.

354
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,795
- A little.
- That is so Franco.

355
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,557
Bottom of the eighth.
Score tied at 1 apiece.

356
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,188
Two and one to Paul O'Neill.

357
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,114
Bobby, it's hard to hit two home runs
in one game, even for Paul O'Neill.

358
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,759
He can do it, Mr. Kramer.

359
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,275
I know he can. He'll do it for me.

360
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:55,352
Long fly ball into deep left field,
and it drops just over Belle's head.

361
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,671
O'Neill's rounding second,
the ball rolling back to the wall.

362
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,751
- O'Neill heading for third.
- Come on!

363
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,593
O'Neill rounds third,
being waved in.

364
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,954
Yeah! Go! Go!

365
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,556
And Martinez throws it
over Alomar's head.

366
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,996
O'Neill is safe at home,
the Yank ees tak e the lead.

367
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,677
Inside-the-park home run!

368
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,749
- Yes, he did it.
- All right.

369
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,512
Yeah, well,
I guess I'll be on my way.

370
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,672
Now, that's being scored
a triple for Paul O'Neill...

371
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,116
...with a throwing error
charged to Martinez.

372
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,474
Hey.

373
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,119
That's not a home run.

374
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,759
Well, maybe not technically, but...

375
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,717
You said he would hit
two home runs.

376
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,348
Come on, Bobby.
Bobby, that's just as good.

377
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,512
- Well, you're not taking that card.
- Now, Bobby, Bobby. We had a deal.

378
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,955
Come on, give me that.

379
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,680
So is the chop
the way you like it?

380
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,910
I usually like mine
with an angioplasty.

381
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,991
Something really stinks to high...

382
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,071
Holly.

383
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,434
What are you doing here?

384
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,591
What everyone does here.
Cooking pork chops.

385
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,390
Listen, I'm meeting James here.

386
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,073
He's bringing over your jacket.

387
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,037
- And what about the napkins?
- Oh, God.

388
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,918
I didn't take your napkins.

389
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,275
- Then who did?
- Ask Jerry.

390
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,715
Hey, we can argue all night
over who took the napkins.

391
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,793
The point is, in today's modern world,
it just doesn't seem relevant.

392
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,394
I still wanna know what happened
to that birthday card.

393
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,916
- Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?
- No, sir. George never gave it to me.

394
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,274
That's right. I didn't.

395
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,034
I take full responsibility
for the card not being here, l...

396
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,316
- I got it.
- What's this?

397
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,438
Oh, it's a birthday card. Yeah.

398
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,838
George, by the way,
tomorrow night...

399
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,594
...Paul O'Neill has to catch
a fly ball in his hat.

400
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,588
George, this is beautiful.

401
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,035
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna have it mounted?

402
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,919
Yeah, you were probably
just gonna stick it in an envelope.

403
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,519
George, keep up the good work.

404
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,918
Well, you screwed me again,
Costanza.

405
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,877
How am I supposed
to sign the card now, huh?

406
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,359
It's already under glass.

407
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,993
Hi, James. Oh, this is...

408
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,040
Excuse me.
What are those dogs wearing?

409
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,509
Oh, bandanas. Aren't they cute?

410
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,910
You gave Mema's napkins
to some dogs?

411
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,759
Hey, what happened to my jacket?

412
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,150
Oh, the dogs did that,
but it wasn't their fault.

413
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,515
Somebody stuffed
some strange meat in the pockets.

414
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,274
- Was it mutton?
- Could have been.

415
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,431
You always stuff
meat in your pockets?

416
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,829
Sometimes I use the sofa.

417
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,359
You wanted to see me?

418
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,317
Yes, George.
Please, come in, come in.

419
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,755
Thanks for the card. I loved it.
It made me feel good.

420
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,990
Word has it you were
the brains behind the thing.

421
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,594
No, no, not just me.
The whole organization.

422
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,954
Especially Mr. Morgan.

423
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,680
Morgan, Morgan. You know,
his name is absent from this card.

424
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,637
Like he went out of his way
not to sign it.

425
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,472
Oh, no, Morgan is a good man, sir.

426
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,790
You can stop.
Congratulations, you've got his job.

427
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,317
Well, thank you, sir. You know,
I'm not quite sure I'm right for it.

428
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,152
It's done, George.
He's out, you're in.

429
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,673
- It's a lot more work.
- I know.

430
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,273
A lot more responsibility.

431
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,078
- Long, long hours.
- I know.

432
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,719
Not much more money.

433
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,348
But you'll finally
get the recognition you deserve.

434
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,748
That's what I'm afraid of.

435
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,069
You know, Mr. Steinbrenner...

436
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,471
George, as painful as it is, I've had
to let a few people go over the years.

437
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,279
Yogi Berra, Lou Piniella...

438
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,034
...Bucky Dent, Billy Martin...

439
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,519
...Dallas Green...

440
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,511
...Dick Hauser, Bill Virdon...

441
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,193
...Billy Martin...

442
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,510
...Stump Merrill, Billy Martin...

443
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,955
...Bob Lemon, Billy Martin...

444
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,190
...Gene Michael, Buck Showalter...

445
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,271
George, you didn't hear that
from me.

446
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,078
George!
