1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,509
People can be so vain.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,508
I have a friend, wears eyeglasses,
no prescription...

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,671
...because he thinks
he looks more intelligent.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,910
Now, why? Why do we think...

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,640
...that glasses makes us look
more intelligent?

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,837
Is it from the endless hours of reading
and studying and researching...

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,639
...that this person supposedly
blew out their eyeballs?

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,360
And that's why
they need the glasses?

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,398
It's a corrective device. If you see
someone with a hearing aid...

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,313
...you don't think, "Oh, they must
have been listening real good.

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,439
Yeah, to a lot of important stuff."
No, they're deaf.

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,239
They can't hear.

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,358
- Hey, boys and girls.
- Hey.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,988
I need you both to sponsor me
in the AIDS Walk.

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,630
- Isn't that tomorrow?
- Yeah, yeah. So get... Get...

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,792
Well, I admire you for joining
the fight against AIDS.

17
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,270
Yeah, well, if I didn't do something,
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,829
It's hard enough living next door.

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,077
Some people,
they just wear a ribbon...

20
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,356
...and they think they're
doing something. Not me.

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:03,114
I talk the talk
and I walk the walk, baby.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,197
Yeah, I'm gonna be right back.

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,716
- New jeans?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,519
- Still a 31 waist?
- Yep, since college.

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,549
- Hey, Lena Small is on this list.
- Lena Small?

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,032
Yeah, that girl I was gonna call
for a date, she was unlisted...

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,192
...and now here's her number.
- Oh, you're not gonna...

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,148
...cop a girl's phone number
off an AIDS charity list.

29
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,995
Elaine, you should admire me.
I'm aspiring to date a giving person.

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,754
- But you're a taking person.
- That's why I should date...

31
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,956
...a giving person.
If I date a taking person...

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,317
...everyone's taking, taking, taking.
No one's giving. It's bedlam.

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,436
She's gonna ask
how you got her number.

34
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,956
Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy
who knew her and he gave it to me.

35
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,315
- What's he look like?
- I didn't pay much attention.

36
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,391
I'd just come
from buying a speedboat.

37
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,518
- You're buying a speedboat?
- See, we're already off the subject...

38
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,113
...of how I got her number.

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,919
All I do is get past the first
phone call and I'm home free.

40
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,196
- I don't know.
- lf Billy got your number...

41
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,033
...off the AIDS Walk list,
you wouldn't have gone out with him?

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,474
- Well...
- Yeah.

43
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,151
- So you really like this guy?
- Very much.

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,871
- How's the sexual chemistry?
- Haven't been in the lab yet.

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,148
But I am
birth-control shopping today.

46
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,713
- Are you still on the pill?
- Oh, Kramer...

47
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,872
No, I think birth control should
be discussed in an open forum.

48
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,151
- The Sponge, okay?
- Sponge?

49
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,878
The Today Sponge.

50
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,078
But wasn't that taken off
the market?

51
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,034
Off the market? The Sponge?
No, no. No way.

52
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,431
- Everybody loves the Sponge.
- I read it in Wall Street Week.

53
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,192
Louis Rukeyser.

54
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,596
Hello, Lena?
Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld.

55
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,432
How did I get your number?

56
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,353
I met a guy that knows you,
he gave it to me.

57
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,917
I don't remember his name.
I think it began with a W, maybe a Q.

58
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,994
I wasn't paying attention.
I'd just come from shopping...

59
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,593
...for a speedboat.

60
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,873
You know, I really like those
new jeans Jerry was wearing.

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,951
He's really thin.

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,596
Not as thin as you think.

63
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,629
Why? He's a 31.
I saw the tag on the back.

64
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,797
The tag, huh?

65
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,234
Let me tell you something
about that tag.

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,872
It's no 31,
and let's just leave it at that.

67
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,069
What are you talking about?

68
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,155
He scratches off a 32
and he puts in "31."

69
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,392
What? Oh, how could
he be so vain?

70
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,552
Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld
that only I know.

71
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,673
- I can't believe I just told you that.
- Why not?

72
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,910
Well, Jerry doesn't want
anyone to know.

73
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,310
It's all right, I'm your fiancée.
Everyone assumes...

74
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,198
...you'll tell me everything.

75
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,590
- Where did you get that from?
- Well, we're a couple. It's understood.

76
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,028
- I never heard of that.
- Well, you've never been a couple.

77
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,679
I've coupled. I've coupled.

78
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,276
Keeping secrets.

79
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,238
This is just like
your secret bank code.

80
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,915
This is totally different. That was
my secret. This is Jerry's secret.

81
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,310
There's attorney-client
privileges here.

82
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,392
If I play it by your rule,
no one will ever confide in me again.

83
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,596
I'll be cut out of the loop.

84
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,597
- Hey.
- Hey.

85
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,308
- What's the matter?
- I had a fight with Susan.

86
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,754
What about?

87
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,436
Clothing something, I don't know...

88
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,196
- So, what are you doing tonight?
- I got a date with that girl Lena.

89
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,036
- Lena? How did you meet her?
- I actually met her a few weeks ago...

90
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,952
...but...

91
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,394
Jerry got Lena's unlisted number
from Kramer's AIDS Walk list.

92
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,553
Monica, Jerry got Lena's unlisted
number off of an AIDS Walk list.

93
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,280
He got her number
off an AIDS Walk list?

94
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,231
You met her
a few weeks ago, but...?

95
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,039
I didn't call her till today.

96
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,555
So, wanna double?

97
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,029
- What?
- Well, you know, I just had a fight.

98
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,633
I need a group dynamic.

99
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,878
- I don't know.
- Hey.

100
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,270
- Hey.
- Well, Kramer was right.

101
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,749
My friend Kim told me
the Sponge is off the market.

102
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,592
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll tell you.

103
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,832
I'm gonna do a hard target search
of every drug store, general store...

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,470
...health store, grocery store
in a 25 block radius:

105
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,714
Just for these Sponges?

106
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,554
Hey, women are really loyal
to their birth-control methods.

107
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,030
- What does Susan use?
- I don't know.

108
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,189
- You don't now?
- I...

109
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,717
Figure it's something.

110
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,235
- What are you all out of breath from?
- The elevator just broke.

111
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,914
I had to walk up five flights.

112
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,231
And you got the AIDS Walk
tomorrow.

113
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,630
You're never gonna make it.
You're in horrible shape.

114
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,837
- I'm in tiptop shape.
- Tiptop?

115
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,436
- Better than you.
- I got a 31 waist, mister.

116
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,396
Well, I'm walking for charity.
What are you doing?

117
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,872
What am I doing? I'm dating a woman
who happens to be sponsoring...

118
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,270
...one of these walkers.

119
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,188
Do you have any Today Sponges?

120
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,793
Do you carry Today Sponges?

121
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,871
- Can I help you?
- Do you have any Today Sponges?

122
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,476
- I know they're off the market...
- Actually, we have a case left.

123
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,677
A case? A case of Sponges?

124
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,159
I mean, a case.

125
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,035
How many come in a case?

126
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,679
Sixty.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,797
Sixty?

128
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,831
- Well, I'll take three.
- Three?

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,195
Yeah. Make it 10.

130
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,677
- Ten?
- Twenty Sponges should be plenty.

131
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,712
- Did you say 20?
- Yeah, 25 Sponges is just fine.

132
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,632
- Twenty-five?
- Yeah.

133
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,836
- You're set with 25?
- Yeah. Yeah.

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,594
Just give me the whole case,
I'll be on my way.

135
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,034
Hey, I have found the best-smelling
detergent. Lena, smell my shirt.

136
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,629
- Very nice.
- It's All TempaCheer.

137
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,636
I use Planet. It's biodegradable...

138
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,392
...and it doesn't pollute the oceans.

139
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,279
Yeah, the oceans are really
getting very sudsy.

140
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,915
Can you wrap up all the leftovers
on the table, please?

141
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,912
I always take the leftovers.

142
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,152
I work in a soup kitchen
every morning at 6 a.m.

143
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,675
They serve soup at 6 a.m.?

144
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,831
Yeah, that's all they have.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,992
Do the bums ever complain,
"Soup again?"

146
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,957
- I'd get tired of it.
- How could you not?

147
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,795
- Guess who volunteered last week.
- Mick Jagger.

148
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,119
No.

149
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,749
- Maya Angelou.
- Oh, the poet.

150
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,198
So let me ask you something. These
people eat soup three times a day?

151
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,237
- I don't know.
- Did you get to talk to her?

152
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,550
- Talk to who?
- Is it a lot of cream soups?

153
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,678
- Maya Angelou, the poet.
- No, I didn't get the chance.

154
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,912
You know, I'm sure you can reach her.
She's a poet, you know.

155
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,116
What does a poet need
an unlisted number for?

156
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,350
- I'm going to the ladies' room.
- I'll go with you.

157
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,713
Why are you
looking at me like that?

158
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,996
Why did you have to mention
"unlisted number"?

159
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,674
- What are you talking about?
- I gotta tell you something...

160
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,398
...but you cannot tell Susan.

161
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,314
Jerry got her phone number
off of an AIDS Walk list?

162
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,675
- Oh, that's awful.
- I know, but don't say anything.

163
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,398
He told me not to tell you.

164
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,039
But you told me anyway?

165
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,398
Well, you know, I was thinking
about what you said before...

166
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,439
...and you're right, I've never really
been a couple, so if that's the rule...

167
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,068
...l'm gonna go by the rule.
- Thank you, honey.

168
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,351
So you wanna go home
and make up officially?

169
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,314
- Can we stop by a drug store first?
- What for?

170
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,913
I'm out of birth control stuff.

171
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,036
Oh, yeah.

172
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,033
- Where am I gonna park?
- No, don't park. I'll just sit in the car.

173
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,829
- You can run in.
- Me run in? Why don't you run in?

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,275
You don't know what I use
for birth control, do you?

175
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,797
- Of course I do.
- You do? What?

176
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,954
- You know, you use the:
- The what?

177
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,509
You know, the:

178
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,352
Just get me some Sponges, please.

179
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,239
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
They don't have them anymore.

180
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,516
- What?
- I just found out they're off the market.

181
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,513
- Off the market? The Sponge?
- So you gotta use something else.

182
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,559
I can't. I love the Sponge.
I need the Sponge.

183
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,512
Okay.

184
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,675
I think I know where we can get one.

185
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,430
Kramer, what the hell
is going on in here?

186
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,229
It's a poker game.
And I'm kicking some serious butt!

187
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,834
Are you out of your mind?
You got the AIDS Walk tomorrow.

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,310
- Hey, Kramer, are you in?
- Oh, you gotta be kidding...

189
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,109
You see those two ladies
I got showing? Do they look scared?

190
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,635
- What were you saying?
- You're never gonna make it.

191
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,308
Let's go! Let's go!
Rack them up! Come on!

192
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,158
Do you...?

193
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,989
Do you wanna go in the bedroom?

194
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,788
Okay.

195
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,951
- Hold on just a second.
- Okay.

196
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,912
Elaine, it's me, George.

197
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,716
- Hey, sorry to bother you so late.
- Yeah.

198
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,632
Hey, how you doing?

199
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,918
- Did you get any of those Sponges?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,708
Cleaned out the whole West Side.

201
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,393
Why?

202
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,231
- Well, Susan.
- Oh, Susan uses the Sponge.

203
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,278
- Susan loves the Sponge.
- Yeah, I'm sorry, George.

204
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,670
- I can't help you out.
- What?

205
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,990
I can't do it. No way.
There's no how.

206
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,310
Wait... Elaine.
Let me explain something to you.

207
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,869
You see, this is not just
a weekend routine.

208
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,871
I'm on the verge
of make-up sex here.

209
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,678
- You know about make-up sex?
- Oh, yeah.

210
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,037
George, I know all about
make-up sex and I'm really sorry.

211
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,428
But, Elaine...

212
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,398
Elaine, can I just explain
something to you very privately.

213
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,836
Susan and I have been together
many, many times now...

214
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,072
...and just between you and me,
there's really no big surprises here...

215
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,038
...so make-up sex
is all that I have left.

216
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,199
I'm sure you'll have
another fight, George.

217
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,073
Hold that thought.

218
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,873
Oh, so listen to this.

219
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,952
But don't tell anyone.

220
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,998
Jerry Seinfeld,
he got a woman's number...

221
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,276
...off an AIDS Walk list.

222
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,238
He got her number
off an AIDS Walk list?

223
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,391
He what?

224
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,678
How did you find out?

225
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,514
A friend of a friend
of a friend knows Susan.

226
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,910
- George!
- Pardon?

227
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,631
- Pardon?
- Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry. I just...

228
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,395
It's okay. There's nothing
to be sorry about. I don't mind.

229
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,520
You don't mind that I got your number
off the AIDS Walk list?

230
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,592
No, not at all. No problem.

231
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,837
Call me later, okay?

232
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,359
You're lucky you're walking out of here
with a pair of pants on!

233
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,396
Kramer, you went all night?

234
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,314
- Jerry, breakfast on me.
- Kramer, are you out of your mind?

235
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,118
You got the AIDS Walk
in three hours.

236
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,919
- You're never gonna make it.
- AIDS Walk, that's a cake walk.

237
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,479
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

238
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,590
- So, George...?
- Yeah.

239
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,630
Guess what? Lena found out
how I got her number.

240
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,078
- Really? How did she do that?
- A friend of a friend of Susan's.

241
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,908
- My Susan?
- Why did you tell her?

242
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,517
I had to, Jerry. It's a couple rule.
We have to tell each other everything.

243
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,591
- You know what this means?
- What?

244
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,149
You're cut off!
You're out of the loop!

245
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,674
You're cutting me off?
No, no, Jerry, don't cut me off.

246
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,831
You leave me no choice.
You're the media now...

247
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,036
...as far as I'm concerned.
- Oh, Jerry, come on.

248
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,553
Please, it won't happen again.

249
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,792
If you were in the Mafia, would you tell
her every time you killed someone?

250
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,077
Hey, a hit is a totally different story.

251
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,279
- I don't know, George.
- So Lena was upset, huh?

252
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,670
You know what,
that was the amazing thing.

253
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,513
- What? It didn't bother her?
- No, she said it was fine.

254
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,511
Something very strange
about this girl.

255
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,999
What?

256
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,432
- She's too good.
- Too good?

257
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,398
I mean, she's giving and caring
and generally concerned...

258
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,189
...about the welfare of others.
I can't be with someone like that.

259
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,755
- I see what you mean.
- I admire the hell out of her.

260
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,195
You can't have sex
with someone you admire.

261
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,790
- Where is the depravity?
- No depravity.

262
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,032
I mean, I look at her.
I can't imagine she even has sex.

263
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,635
On the other hand...

264
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,757
- What?
- Thanks again for last night.

265
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,309
- Hey, I didn't even use one.
- Yeah.

266
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,391
- I thought you said it was imminent.
- It was.

267
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,758
But then I just couldn't decide
if he was really spongeworthy.

268
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,234
Spongeworthy?

269
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,516
Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve...

270
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,432
...these Sponges.
- But you like this guy.

271
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,431
- Isn't that what the Sponges are for?
- Yes.

272
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,637
Before they went off the market.
But now I've got to re-evaluate...

273
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,233
...my whole screening process.

274
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,709
I can't afford to waste any of them.

275
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,513
You know, you're nuts
with these Sponges.

276
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,148
George is getting frustrated.

277
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,637
Cosmo Kramer.

278
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,518
- Okay. You're checked in.
- Thank you.

279
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,272
- Here's your AIDS ribbon.
- No, thanks.

280
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,557
- You don't wanna wear one?
- No, no.

281
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,950
- But you have to wear an AIDS ribbon.
- I have to?

282
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,436
- Yes.
- See, that's why I don't want to.

283
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,990
But everyone wears the ribbon.
You must wear the ribbon.

284
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,549
You know what you are?
You're a ribbon bully.

285
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,474
Hey! Hey, you, come back here!
Come back here and put this on!

286
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,596
Elaine and her Sponges. She's got
like a war chest full of them.

287
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,671
I don't see
why you can't just use condoms.

288
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,992
Oh, no, no.
No, condoms are for single men.

289
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,550
The day that we got engaged, I said
goodbye to the condom forever.

290
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,276
Just once, for the make-up sex.

291
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,237
Make-up sex?
You have to have that...

292
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,311
...right after the fight.
We're way past that.

293
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,675
- Come on, just once.
- No, no, I hate the condom.

294
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,478
Why?

295
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,313
I can never get the package
open in time.

296
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,876
- Well, you just tear it open.
- It's not that easy.

297
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,600
It's like Beat the Clock.
There's a lot of pressure there.

298
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,795
- Hey, where's your ribbon?
- Oh, I don't wear the ribbon.

299
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,474
You don't wear the ribbon?
Aren't you against AIDS?

300
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,712
Yeah, I'm against AIDS.
I mean, I'm walking, aren't I?

301
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,314
- I just don't wear the ribbon.
- Who do you think you are?

302
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,153
- Put the ribbon on.
- Hey, Cedric, Bob.

303
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,799
This guy won't wear a ribbon.

304
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,952
Who? Who doesn't
want to wear the ribbon?

305
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,558
- So you think you're spongeworthy?
- Yes, I think I'm spongeworthy.

306
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,075
I think I'm very spongeworthy.

307
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,518
Run down your case for me again.

308
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,514
Well, we've gone out several times.
We obviously have a good rapport.

309
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,638
I own a very profitable
electronics distributing firm.

310
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,758
I eat well. I exercise.
Blood tests, immaculate.

311
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,792
And if I can speak frankly,
I'm actually quite good at it.

312
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,279
You gonna do something...

313
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,749
...about your sideburns?
- Yeah, I told you.

314
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,071
I'm gonna trim my sideburns.

315
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,477
- And the bathroom in your apartment?
- Cleaned it this morning.

316
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,315
- The sink, the tub, everything clean?
- Everything. It's spotless.

317
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,590
- All right, let's go.
- Okay.

318
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,594
- Hi.
- Hi.

319
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,755
Hey, look at this. I just got a citation
in the mail for my work with shut-ins.

320
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,717
Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice.

321
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,110
You know, they're
a very eccentric group...

322
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,114
...because they're shut in.
Of course, they're not locked in...

323
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,077
...they're free to go at any time.

324
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,359
Oh, by the way, I checked at the soup
kitchen, they do have cream soups.

325
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,397
Hey, that's dynamite.
You know, Lena...

326
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,996
...I wanted to talk to you
about something.

327
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,960
You know, because
you're such a good person...

328
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,872
...that l...
- Oh, hang on to that thought.

329
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,679
I'm rinsing a sweater.
I left the water running.

330
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,400
Hey, Jerry, can you get me a towel
out of my bedroom closet?

331
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,198
Oh, okay.

332
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,354
Oh, my God.
Look what's going on here.

333
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,189
She is depraved.

334
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,388
- There you are.
- Thanks.

335
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,998
- So you were saying...?
- What? Nothing.

336
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,469
No, you said I was a good person...

337
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,792
You seem like
you wanna tell me something.

338
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,719
Tell you something? I do.

339
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,348
What is it, Jerry?
You can tell me anything.

340
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,837
- You see these jeans I'm wearing?
- Yeah?

341
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,673
I change the 32 waist on the label...

342
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,435
...to a 31 on all my jeans.

343
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,076
So you know...

344
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,350
That's it.

345
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,393
- Come on, George, just rip it open.
- I'm trying, damn it.

346
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,994
- Tear it from the side.
- I tried to tear it from the side.

347
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,720
I can't get a good grip.
You gotta do it like a bag of chips.

348
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,154
- Give it to me.
- Wait a second.

349
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,276
- Give it to me. Give it to me.
- Wait a second.

350
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,317
You see? You see?

351
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,277
I got it.

352
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,312
Come on.

353
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,199
Come on.

354
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,551
It's too late.

355
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,509
So, what's it going to be?

356
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,511
Are you going to wear the ribbon?

357
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,791
No. Never.

358
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,349
But I'm wearing the ribbon.
He's wearing the ribbon.

359
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,112
We are all wearing the ribbon.

360
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,191
So why aren't you
going to wear the ribbon?

361
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,033
This is America. I don't have to wear
anything I don't want to!

362
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,556
- What are we gonna do with him?
- I guess we're just going to...

363
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,280
...have to teach him
to wear the ribbon.

364
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,313
- It completely turned her off.
- Well, I can see that.

365
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,517
Why do you have to do that for?
Who cares about your pant size?

366
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,750
I don't wanna be a 32.

367
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,311
I'd kill to be a 32.

368
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,314
She said I wasn't spongeworthy.
Wouldn't waste a Sponge on me.

369
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,672
I wish I had one.
That condom killed me.

370
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,752
Why do they have to make
the wrappers so hard to open?

371
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:13,913
It's probably so the woman has
one last chance to change her mind.

372
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,710
You never run out, do you?
Where's Kramer?

373
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,599
- Everything's finished here.
- I told him he'd never make it.

374
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,876
He was up all night.

375
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,031
Oh, my God. Kramer?

376
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,989
Look at you. I told you.

377
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,879
Up all night playing poker.

378
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,872
Come on.

379
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,790
Hey, where's your AIDS ribbon?

380
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,796
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

381
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,033
How did you sleep?

382
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,598
Great.

383
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,990
- You?
- Fine, fine.

384
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,879
Everything okay?

385
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,754
- Yep.
- No regrets?

386
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,832
Nope.

387
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,356
- What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

388
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,034
Oh, I don't think so.

389
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,154
Why not? I thought you said
everything was fine.

390
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,551
I wish I could help you,
but I can't afford two of them.
