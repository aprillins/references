1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,149
Men...

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,357
...flip around the television
more than women, I think.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,552
Men get that remote control
in their hands...

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,676
They don't even know
what they're not watching.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,195
" Rerun, don't wanna watch it."
"What are you watching?"

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,112
" Don't care." "Who was that?"
" Don't know."

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,999
" Isn't that your father?"
" Doesn't matter, I gotta keep going."

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,510
Women don't do that.
See, now, women...

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,877
...will stop and go, "Well,
let me see what the show is...

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,110
...before I change the channel."

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,475
You see, but men just fly.
Because women...

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,950
You see, women nest,
and men hunt.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,270
That's why we watch TV differently.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,159
Before there was flipping around,
before there was television...

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,356
...kings and emperors
and pharaohs and such...

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,795
...had storytellers that would
tell them stories.

17
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,188
That was their entertainment.

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,035
I always wonder in that era if they
would get 30 storytellers together...

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,031
...so they could still flip around.
Just go:

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,475
"Tell me your story.
I don't wanna hear anymore.

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,551
Shut up. Next guy.
What are you talking about?

22
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,517
Is there a girl in that story?
No? Shut up.

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,557
What have you got?
I don't wanna hear that.

24
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,756
What are you talking about?
Don't wanna hear it.

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,388
Now, the whole of you,
get out of here. I'm going to bed."

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,399
She's pregnant?

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,549
Leslie is pregnant?
Oh, see, there is no justice.

28
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,278
She's the performance artist, right?

29
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,398
Yeah, performance artist.
She's a performer, a real trouper.

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,194
What's her husband's name again?
Chip?

31
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,588
Kip?

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,028
Skip?

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,596
- Todd.
- Todd.

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,751
Oh, yeah.

35
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,672
- He's a Kennedy.
- No, he's not.

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,116
- Come on, he's a third cousin.
- By marriage.

37
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,875
Oh, by marriage, yeah.
We went to the wedding.

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,951
Should've heard them talk
about Chappaquiddick.

39
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,680
Tried to blame the whole thing
on bad directions.

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,400
That woman was unequivocally
the worst date of my life.

41
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,318
Pardon me for setting you up
with a beautiful, intelligent woman.

42
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,392
What, you don't think I can attract
beautiful, intelligent women?

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,235
Thin ice, George, very thin ice.

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,552
Maybe for her new performance
piece, she'll give birth on-stage.

45
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,913
She stopped performing.

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,878
What a huge blow to the culture.

47
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,237
You believe this guy?
He holds a grudge like Khomeini.

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,072
She dragged me down
to that warehouse...

49
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,312
...on the waterfront in Brooklyn
to see one of her performances.

50
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,831
Oh, and she's on-stage cooking
dinner for some celebrity?

51
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,594
God.

52
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,910
She's cooking dinner for God.

53
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,957
She's yelling,
and the next thing I know...

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,476
...she throws a big can of chocolate
syrup all over my new red shirt.

55
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,870
- It was an accident.
- Oh, yeah, accident, right.

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,600
She was aiming at me,
like she was putting out a fire.

57
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,152
So for the rest of the show I'm sitting
there with chocolate all over me.

58
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,788
Flies are landing on me.

59
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,032
I'm boiling, I'm fantasizing
all the things I'm gonna say to her.

60
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,270
Later, finally, backstage,
when I talk to her...

61
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,396
...l'm like a little grovelling worm:

62
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,676
"What kind of chocolate was that?"

63
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,990
" Do you throw any other foods?"
You know...

64
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,479
He thought he still had a shot.

65
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,994
Then, then, then...

66
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,991
...she leaves with somebody else.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,752
Never even...
Never even said goodbye.

68
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,229
Never called me back.
Never apologized. Nothing.

69
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,152
Like I was dirt.

70
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,236
What ever happened with the shirt?

71
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,508
I still have it.

72
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,598
The collar's okay.
I wear it under sweaters.

73
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,839
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,036
She asked me to give her
a baby shower.

75
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,714
Asked you?
You're not gonna do that, are you?

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,277
Anyone else, never.
But Leslie...

77
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,032
I have a problem saying no to her.

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,270
For some reason,
I seem to want her approval.

79
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,398
Let Maria Shriver
give her a baby shower.

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,028
Ask not what I can do for you,
ask what you can do for me.

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,349
Ich bin ein sucker.

82
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,831
Would you two stop
with the Kennedys?

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,753
Why does everyone make such
a big deal about the Kennedys?

84
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,152
I mean, what is this fascination?
Who cares? It's all so boring.

85
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,197
Look, she doesn't deserve
a baby shower.

86
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,796
She deserves a baby monsoon.
She deserves Rosemary's baby.

87
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,193
I do have one teeny
little problem, though.

88
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,999
Never said goodbye.
Never apologized. Nothing.

89
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:11,711
See, I was gonna give
the shower in my apartment...

90
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,792
- But?
- My roommate has Lyme disease.

91
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,679
Lyme disease? I thought she had
Epstein-Barr syndrome.

92
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,400
She has this in addition
to Epstein-Barr.

93
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,950
It's like Epstein-Barr
with a twist of Lyme disease.

94
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,317
- How'd she get Lyme disease?
- I don't know.

95
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,756
She did some outdoor version of Hair
in Danbury, Connecticut.

96
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,229
- They still do that play?
- It's a classic.

97
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,357
- With the nudity?
- I guess.

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,197
She must've rolled over
on a tick during the love-in.

99
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,672
Never said goodbye. Goodbye.

100
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,630
Explain to me how
this baby shower thing works.

101
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,434
What do you want to know?

102
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,115
Well, I mean does it ever erupt
into a drunken orgy of violence?

103
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,158
Rarely.

104
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,835
There's no hazing of the foetus
or anything, is there?

105
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,793
No.

106
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,916
- When is this supposed to be?
- Saturday.

107
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,834
Saturday. Well, I have a show
in Buffalo on Saturday.

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,036
They're not gonna bust up
my apartment, are they?

109
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,952
No, I'll take full responsibility.

110
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,633
Because I've seen pregnant women...

111
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,155
...and they sometimes
misjudge their foetal girth.

112
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,514
And they'll...

113
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,275
Just, like, one wrong turn, the whole
buffet is, like, right off the table.

114
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,440
Someday, before I die,
mark my words...

115
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,795
...l'm gonna tell that woman
what I think of her.

116
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,679
I'll never be able
to forgive myself until I do.

117
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,876
- And if you do?
- I still won't forgive myself...

118
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,349
...but at least it won't be about this.

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,275
What are you doing this for?
Look at you.

120
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,113
- Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.
- But you don't have to.

121
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,953
- The guy is waiting in my house.
- Leave me alone.

122
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,429
It's a one-time fee, 1 50 bucks.

123
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,036
- Why live like this?
- I'm not getting illegal cable.

124
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,394
So you're gonna wait for the cable
companies to resolve their dispute?

125
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,994
They'll be in court for years.

126
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,912
- I read in the paper...
- Oh, the paper...

127
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,311
- They might hook us up again.
- Oh, God. You're so naive.

128
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,109
All the cable companies care about
is the big "mamoo."

129
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,230
Look at you. You're banging things.
You're just pathetic.

130
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,630
Just wasting your life.

131
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm offering you 56 channels.

132
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,514
Movies, sports, nudity,
and it's free for life!

133
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,711
Stop shouting.
You're ruining the reception.

134
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,677
Can you hear yourself?
Can...?

135
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,070
Do you know what you're saying?

136
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,516
- What you're suggesting is illegal.
- It's not illegal.

137
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,513
- It's against the law.
- Well, yeah.

138
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,311
Just hold this.
Can you hold that?

139
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,948
Look, will you at least
let me bring the guy over?

140
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,395
He's an amazing man.
He's a Russian immigrant.

141
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,152
He escaped from the Gulag.

142
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,278
He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.

143
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,757
He'll slow down your gas meter.
He sells slugs, Jerry.

144
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,673
Slugs for the subway.

145
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,479
- He's a real human-rights nut, huh?
- Yeah.

146
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,159
He's intense, man.

147
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,033
I don't know.

148
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,509
- What if I get caught?
- You're not gonna get caught.

149
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,878
Let me get him in. It's the '90s.
It's Hammer Time. Come on.

150
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,837
Just let me get him.

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,309
Jerry, Jerry,
this is the cable man.

152
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,597
You know, why don't we wait...

153
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,671
...because I'm going
out of town tomorrow...

154
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,671
Tomorrow okay.

155
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,150
No problem. You'll have
the whole thing installed...

156
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,469
...by the time you get back.

157
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,871
No, every time I turn on a TV,
sirens are gonna go off.

158
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,395
They're gonna track me down
like a dog, I know it.

159
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,552
Look, now, Jerry, it's no risk.
I swear.

160
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,714
The Mets have 7 5 games
on cable this year.

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,194
Put it in.

162
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,594
You won't regret it.

163
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,231
Yeah, Jerry's gonna be a cable boy
A cable boy, a cable boy

164
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,760
- Mr. Steinfeld?
- Seinfeld.

165
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,913
We're with the FBI. You wanna
tell us about your cable hookup?

166
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,512
My cable hookup?
What about it?

167
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,432
It's been illegally installed.

168
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,274
It has? I've been out of town.
How did you know?

169
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,591
Jerry, I had to tell them.
I had to. I had no choice.

170
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,793
They were onto the scam
from the very beginning.

171
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,996
You're in very serious trouble,
Mr. Steinfeld.

172
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,879
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold on. We're just patsies.

173
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,315
We're just a couple of users.
We never sold the stuff.

174
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,199
What about the Russian guy?
The Russian guy's the guy you want.

175
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,989
Mr. Seinfeld? Agent Stone,
FBI undercover.

176
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,917
No, Jerry!

177
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,872
No!

178
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,832
Cable boy?

179
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,877
Cable boy?

180
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,311
What have you done
to my little cable boy?

181
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,677
Excuse me, could I get
something to drink?

182
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,558
I'm afraid not.

183
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,555
What's with this airline?
You're cutting out the drinks?

184
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,357
No, sir, we're flying into a blizzard.
Please fasten your seat belt.

185
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,158
We're making an emergency landing.

186
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,308
Are they gonna go over
the instructions again?

187
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,875
My name is Bill.

188
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,635
I might be the last person
you ever see.

189
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,078
I'm not afraid of flying, although
many people do have fear of flying.

190
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,437
And I have no argument with that.
I think fear of flying...

191
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,956
...is quite rational,
because human beings cannot fly.

192
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,231
Humans have fear of flying,
same way fish have fear of driving.

193
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,592
You put a fish behind the wheel,
and they go, "This isn't right.

194
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,836
I shouldn't be doing this.

195
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,516
I don't belong here."

196
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,912
- Sounds like a rough trip.
- Well...

197
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,799
...there were fire engines and
ambulances all on the runway.

198
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,475
And then when we landed safely,
they all seemed so disappointed.

199
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,393
So the college cancelled the gig?

200
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,516
There was so much snow,
the roads were closed.

201
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,910
I really appreciate
you picking me up. Thanks again.

202
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,839
- Forget it.
- No, really, an airport run.

203
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,433
It's nothing.

204
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,273
It's one thing if I asked you,
" Could you do me a favour?"

205
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,634
But to suggest it...

206
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,549
When you told me what
you went through on the plane...

207
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,472
...it makes you stop and think.

208
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,995
I appreciate having a real friend.

209
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,116
If Richie Brandis did this,
I'd be suspicious.

210
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,714
You know how he's always got
some ulterior motive?

211
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,551
Ulterior motive...

212
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,715
Wait a minute. Don't take
the bridge. Get off here.

213
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,394
We can't go back to my place.
Elaine's having the shower.

214
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,269
- What, tonight? Now?
- Yeah. Yeah, I forgot all about it.

215
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,237
No big deal.
We'll go back to your place.

216
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,029
My place? No, no. I hate my place.
I don't wanna go back to my place.

217
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,679
Well, you wanna get a bite?

218
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,071
Well, yeah, I would. It's just that
I just ate a whole pot roast.

219
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,351
Well, so, what should we do?

220
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,153
You know, shouldn't we
at least drop off your bag?

221
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,549
Red shirt! Red shirt!
That's the red shirt!

222
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,553
- What are you talking about?
- You're wearing the chocolate shirt!

223
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,756
I am. What a strange coincidence.

224
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,191
Nice try, my friend, but you gotta
get up pretty early in the morning.

225
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,634
You gotta let me go over there.

226
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,156
What, you're gonna badger a pregnant
woman at her own baby shower?

227
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,914
You're gonna take it off and
make her rinse it in club soda?

228
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,913
No. I'm gonna hold it under her nose
so she can smell the scent...

229
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,548
...of stale Bosco that I had
to live with for three years.

230
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,280
Then I'm gonna say, " Remember
this shirt, baby? Well, now...

231
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,668
...it's payback time!"

232
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,316
We just bought an apartment
on Riverside Drive.

233
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,318
Bernard Goetz's mother
used to live there.

234
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,552
- So where's Todd?
- Up in Hyannisport.

235
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,832
Oh, my God, Hyannisport?
With the Kennedys?

236
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,117
Who else is up there?
Is Rose up there?

237
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,234
- So when's your due date?
- March 20th, 9 a.m.

238
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,198
- You know the time?
- I'm having a planned C-section.

239
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,035
My therapist told me if I go
through labour, I might get psychotic.

240
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,112
Leslie, Leslie, what ever
happened to Sargent Shriver?

241
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,999
Is he still with them? You don't hear
much about him these days.

242
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,958
Is he, like, out of the loop, or...?

243
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,477
Elaine, who catered this, Sears?

244
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,430
What is this?
What are you doing here?

245
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,238
- We're putting in the cable.
- The cable?

246
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,595
No, I'm having a party here.
You can't do this now.

247
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,274
Oh, we have to do this now.

248
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,829
- Who is this guy?
- Which one?

249
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,958
- Both of them.
- They're Soviet cable guys.

250
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,839
Okay. Does Jerry know about this?

251
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,275
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's all authorized. Yeah.

252
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,512
- You can't. You can't do this now!
- Elaine...

253
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,035
Do you know how booked up
this guy is?

254
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,715
If I send him away now, it's gonna take
Jerry months to get him back.

255
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,074
He won't like that.

256
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,353
All right. Just do it fast,
and then get out.

257
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,838
Anatole? Giddap. Go.

258
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,632
It's only gonna take
a few minutes.

259
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,631
Then you and the gals
can take a load off...

260
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,075
...and watch something on Lifetime.

261
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,794
What if we go up there,
what are you gonna say to her?

262
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,349
- What am I gonna say?
- Yeah.

263
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,111
"What did you go out
with me for?

264
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:56,319
Just to dump chocolate on my shirt,
and then dump me altogether?

265
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,869
I don't deserve
that kind of treatment.

266
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,399
You don't have the common courtesy
to return my calls? To apologize?

267
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,758
You think I'm some sort of a loser
that likes to be abused and ignored?

268
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,356
Whose shirt can be ruined
without financial restitution?

269
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,513
Some sort of a masochist
who enjoys being humiliated?

270
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,514
You think you can just avoid me
like I have some disease?

271
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,910
You have the disease!
You have the disease!

272
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,799
You may be beautiful and
rich and physically...

273
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,757
...just unbelievable,
but you sicken me.

274
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,276
You disgust me.
You and everyone like you."

275
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,272
- You'll never say that to her face.
- Watch me.

276
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,070
Yeah, I eat the whole apple.
Core, stem, seeds, just everything.

277
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,592
Kramer. Kramer, look at him.

278
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,514
- Look. He's eating all the food.
- Yeah, yeah.

279
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,636
Well, you know,
there are many differences...

280
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,758
...between American and Soviet
cultures that you're not aware of.

281
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,593
See, in Russia, the cable guy,
they got the whole run of the house.

282
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,751
Yeah, that's tradition.

283
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,394
You ever eat the bark
off of a pineapple?

284
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,556
- Kramer! Kramer!
- Excuse me.

285
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,348
Wow, man!

286
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,314
What are you doing here?
I thought you were out of town.

287
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,357
The show was cancelled.
There was a blizzard.

288
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,671
I can't believe you told Kramer
to install cable during the shower.

289
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,593
Jerry, look, look.
They've eaten everything.

290
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,830
Jerry, what a surprise.
I thought you'd left town.

291
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,470
Well, Leslie, sometimes
the road less travelled...

292
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,198
...is less travelled for a reason.

293
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,557
George, don't even think about it.
Don't even dream about it.

294
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,199
- About what?
- Kramer!

295
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,919
Leslie.

296
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,108
Yeah?

297
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,433
George.

298
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,712
George Costanza.

299
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,352
Hi.

300
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,275
I guess you don't remember me...

301
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,876
...but we actually went out
a couple years ago...

302
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,998
...once. Remember?

303
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,519
- Vaguely.
- Yeah.

304
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,513
You took me to see one
of your shows.

305
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,392
And?

306
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,751
And...

307
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,157
...it was quite good.

308
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,711
In fact, you even incorporated me
into the show.

309
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,668
I'm not actually a performer,
although my parents felt I had talent...

310
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,558
Jerry?

311
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,717
Remember me?

312
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,830
- I'm sorry...
- Mary Contardi. No?

313
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,878
Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry?
We had a date three years ago.

314
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,758
You took me to one of your shows.

315
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,509
- I think I remember.
- Told me you had a great time.

316
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,240
- Said you'd call me the next day.
- I'm sure I meant to call.

317
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,152
- I probably just lost your...
- Liar!

318
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,548
Liar!

319
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,233
You were never going to call me.

320
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,437
You thought you could waltz through
life and never bump into me again.

321
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,955
But you were wrong, Jerry.
You were wrong.

322
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,275
What do you think?
I'm some poor pathetic wretch?

323
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,749
- I didn't think that.
- To be dismissed and ignored.

324
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,319
Some insignificant piece of dust?

325
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,789
Some person who doesn't
deserve respect and attention?

326
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,793
Well, you're the one who doesn't
deserve my respect and attention!

327
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,793
You're the insignificant piece of dust!

328
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,474
Actually, I never had
any formal training.

329
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,757
I guess I'd be better suited
for improvs or something...

330
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,557
Thanks a lot.

331
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,519
Oh, bye.

332
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,196
- Oh, I'm so sorry you have to go.
- Yeah, I really have to be going.

333
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,678
All right, listen. I've changed my mind.
I don't want the cable.

334
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,111
- Jerry, don't be a fool.
- You don't want?

335
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,999
No, I don't want. Tell me what
I owe you for your trouble...

336
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,674
Four hundred dollars.

337
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,070
Four hundred dollars.

338
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,151
You told me 1 50.

339
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,676
Oh, well...

340
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,150
I'm going. Obviously.

341
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,189
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about
everything that went on here tonight.

342
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,554
- I had no idea...
- Elaine...

343
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,075
...I was watching you tonight,
and I realized something.

344
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,753
You're just like you were
in college.

345
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,791
Thank you.

346
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,430
What was I like in college?

347
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,398
Come on, let's go.

348
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,838
Be right back.

349
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,272
I'm not paying $400.
I don't even want the thing.

350
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,438
What are you gonna do?

351
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,634
Every woman on the face
of the earth...

352
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,712
...has complete control of my life...

353
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,155
...and yet I want them all.

354
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,797
Is that irony?

355
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,673
Why can't I meet a Kennedy?

356
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,030
I saw John Jr. Once downtown.
I was on a bus.

357
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,758
I hit the...

358
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,512
...ding.

359
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,037
It didn't stop.

360
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,112
All right. I said I had
a good time and I'd call...

361
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,555
...but who takes that literally?

362
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,597
Hey, come on over. Doctor Zhivago's
on cable in five minutes.

363
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,430
I'm making popcorn!

364
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,998
What do you do at the end
of a date when you know...

365
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,472
...you don't want to see this person
ever again for the rest of your life?

366
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,915
What do you say? What do you say?

367
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,516
It doesn't...
No matter what you say, it's a lie.

368
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,356
" I'll see you around.

369
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,071
See you around.

370
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:35,189
If you're around and I'm around...

371
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,758
...l'll see you around that area.

372
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,876
You'll be around other people,
you won't be around me...

373
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,474
...but you will be around.

374
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,318
Take care now."

375
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,631
You ever say that to somebody?
"Take care now.

376
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,230
Take care... now.

377
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,959
Because I'm not gonna be
taking care of you...

378
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,317
...so you should take care now."

379
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,189
"Take care, take care."
What does that mean? "Take care."

380
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,238
"Take off." Isn't that what
you really wanna say?

381
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,311
"Take off now.

382
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,832
Get out of here."

383
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,711
