1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,900
The bad thing about television...

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,500
...is that everybody you see on
television is doing something better...

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,100
...than what you're doing.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,700
You never see anybody
on TV sliding off the sofa...

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,300
...with crumbs on their face.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,500
Some people have a
little too much fun.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,000
The soda commercial people.

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,800
Where do they summon
this enthusiasm?

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,700
Have you seen them? "We have soda!
We have soda! We have soda!"

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,100
Jumping, laughing,
flying through the air.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,700
It's a can of soda.

12
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,100
Have you ever been standing there
and you're watching TV...

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,900
...and you're drinking
the exact product...

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,800
...that they're advertising
right there on TV?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,300
And it's like, you know, they're spiking
volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis...

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,800
...and I'm standing there, " Maybe I'm
putting too much ice in mine."

17
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,300
So then, as we were leaving...

18
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,600
...we were just kind of standing there,
and she was smiling at me.

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,600
I wasn't sure if she wanted
me to ask her out.

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,700
When women smile,
I don't know what it means.

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,900
Sometimes I interpret it like
they're psychotic.

22
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,300
I don't know if I'm
supposed to smile back.

23
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,300
I just stood there.
Remember Quayle when...

24
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,200
...Bentsen gave him the Kennedy
line? That's what I looked like.

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,200
- So you didn't ask?
- No. I froze.

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
- Counter.
- Oh, yeah. So wait, wait.

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,200
Half-hour later I'm back at the office.
I tell Lloyd the story.

28
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,900
He says, "Why don't you call her?"
I says, "I can't!" I couldn't do it then.

29
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,700
For me to ask a woman out,
I gotta get into a mental state...

30
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,100
...like karate guys
before they break bricks.

31
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,800
So then Lloyd calls me a wuss.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,300
- He said "wuss"?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,500
Anyway, he shamed me into it.

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,400
- So you called?
- Right.

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,900
And to cover my nervousness,
I started eating an apple.

36
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,900
I think if they hear you chewing
on the other end of the phone...

37
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,200
...makes you sound casual.
- Yeah, like a farm boy.

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,300
Right. So I call her up,
I tell her it's me.

39
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,100
She gives me an enthusiastic "Hi!"

40
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,600
Enthusiastic hi,
that's beautiful.

41
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't get the enthusiastic hi,
I'm out of there.

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,000
So you're chewing your apple.
You got your enthusiastic hi.

43
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,700
We're talking. I don't go
too long before I ask them out.

44
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,800
I want to get it over with right away.

45
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,700
So I just blurt out, "What are
you doing Saturday night?"

46
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,200
And?

47
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,900
She bought.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,400
Great day in the morning.

49
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,300
Then I got off the phone right away.

50
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,000
It's like robbing a bank. Don't loiter in
front of the teller with a bag of money.

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,300
You make your hit and get out.

52
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,200
We both have dates
on the same night.

53
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,300
I can't remember
the last time that happened.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,600
I can't stand doing laundry, that's
why I have 40 pairs of underwear.

55
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,500
- You do not.
- Absolutely.

56
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,700
Because instead of doing a wash,
I just keep buying underwear.

57
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,700
My goal is to have over 360 pair.

58
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,400
That way, I only have
to do wash once a year.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
Come on, try it!

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,100
Let me hear you
try a Scottish accent.

61
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,700
- That's Irish.
- Irish, Scottish.

62
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,000
What's the difference, lassie?

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,500
So thanks for dinner.
It was great.

64
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,000
Yeah.

65
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,200
We should do this again.

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,500
Would you like to come
upstairs for coffee?

67
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,800
No, thanks. I can't drink coffee
at night. It keeps me up.

68
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,400
So...

69
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,800
Okay.

70
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,500
Okay.

71
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,300
Good night.

72
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,800
Yeah. Take it easy.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,100
- Thanks again for the movie.
- You're welcome.

74
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,000
I'd invite you up,
but the place is being painted.

75
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,600
Oh, that's okay.

76
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,700
Unless you want to go to your place.

77
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,800
Okay, but there's no cake or anything,
if that's what you're looking for.

78
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,300
"Take it easy."

79
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,500
"Take it easy!"

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,600
I think if one's going to kill oneself...

81
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,500
...the least you could do is leave
a note. It's common courtesy.

82
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,900
I don't know.

83
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,400
That's just the way
I was brought up.

84
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,800
- Values are important.
- So important.

85
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,800
What are you doing Thursday night?
You wanna have dinner?

86
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,800
Thursday's great.

87
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,100
Tan pants.

88
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,400
Why do I buy tan pants, Donna?

89
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,200
I don't feel comfortable in them.

90
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,400
Are those cotton Dockers?

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I can't begin to tell you how much
I hate that commercial.

92
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,700
Really?

93
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
I like that commercial.

94
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,600
You like that commercial?

95
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,100
Yeah. It's clever.

96
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,200
You mean the one where the guys
are all standing around...

97
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,200
...supposedly being very
casual and witty?

98
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Yeah. That's the one.

99
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,500
What could you possibly
like about that?

100
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't know. I like the guys.

101
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,600
Yeah they're so funny and so
comfortable with each other.

102
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,900
And I could be comfortable too,
if I had pants like that.

103
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,700
I could sit on a porch
and wrestle around...

104
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,300
...and maybe even be
part of a real bull session.

105
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,700
I know guys like that. To me,
the dialogue rings true.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,900
Even if the dialogue did ring true...

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,400
...even if somehow, somewhere men
actually talk like that...

108
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,500
...what does that have
anything to do with the pants?

109
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,800
Doesn't that bother you?

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,900
That's the idea.
That is what is clever about it.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,900
- They're not talking about pants.
- They're talking about nothing.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,800
- That's the point.
- I know the point.

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,700
No one is telling you to like it.

114
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,700
All those quick shots of the pants.
Just pants, pants, pants, pants.

115
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,000
What is that supposed to be?

116
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,000
What's brutal about the date is the
scrutiny you put each other through.

117
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,900
Because whenever you
think about this person...

118
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,800
...in terms of the future, you have
to magnify everything about them.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,200
The guy will be like, " I don't think
her eyebrows are even.

120
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,200
Could I look at uneven eyebrows
for the rest of my life?"

121
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,600
Of course, the woman's looking
at the guy thinking:

122
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,000
"What is he looking at?

123
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,400
Do I want someone looking at me
like this for the rest of my life?"

124
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,200
I'm supposed to see her
again on Thursday.

125
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,100
But can I go out with someone that
actually likes this commercial?

126
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,000
I once broke up with a guy because
he didn't keep his bathroom clean.

127
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
No kidding. Did you tell him
that was the reason?

128
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,900
Yeah. I told him all the time.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,400
You would not have
believed his tub.

130
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Germs were building
a town in there.

131
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,200
They were constructing offices.

132
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,300
Houses near the drain
were going for $150,000.

133
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,500
Hi.

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,700
You're still thinking about this?

135
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,600
She invites me up at 12:00
at night for coffee.

136
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,000
And I don't go up.

137
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,300
"No, thank you.

138
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,500
I don't want coffee.

139
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,500
It keeps me up.

140
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,500
Too late for me to drink coffee."

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,700
I said this to her.

142
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,100
People this stupid
shouldn't be allowed to live.

143
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,200
I can't imagine what
she must think of me.

144
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,400
She thinks you're a guy
that doesn't like coffee.

145
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,700
She invited me up!
Coffee's not coffee.

146
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,300
- Coffee is sex.
- Maybe coffee was coffee.

147
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,100
Coffee's coffee in the morning,
not at 12:00 at night.

148
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,700
Some people drink coffee that late.

149
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah, people who work at NORAD
who are on 24-hour missile watch.

150
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,800
Everything was going along so great.
She was laughing.

151
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,500
I was funny.

152
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,500
I kept saying to myself, " Keep it up,
don't blow it. You're doing great."

153
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,500
It's all in your head. All she knows
is she had a good time.

154
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,600
- I think you should call her.
- I can't call her now. It's too soon.

155
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,700
I'm planning a Wednesday call.

156
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,500
Why? I love it when guys
call me the next day.

157
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,200
Of course you do, but you're
imagining a guy you like.

158
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,900
Not a guy who goes, " No. I don't
drink coffee late at night."

159
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
If I call her now,
she's gonna think I'm needy.

160
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,400
Women don't want to see need.

161
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,300
They want a take-charge guy,
a colonel, a Kaiser, a czar.

162
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,500
All she'll think is that you like her.

163
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,900
That's exactly what
I'm trying to avoid.

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,600
She wants you to like her.

165
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,400
Yes, she wants me to like her, if she
likes me, but she doesn't like me.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,100
I don't know what your parents
did to you.

167
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,500
Hey.

168
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,800
Hey. I just thought of a really
funny thing for your act.

169
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,400
All right. You're up there.
You're on stage, and you go:

170
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,000
"You ever notice
how cars here in New York...

171
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
...never get out of the way
of ambulances?

172
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,300
Someone's in a life-and-death
situation, and we're thinking:

173
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,900
'Sorry, buddy.

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Should've thought of that when you
were eating cheese omelets...

175
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,800
...for breakfast every morning
for the last 30 years."'

176
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,000
So you gonna use it?

177
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't think so.

178
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,200
- Well, it's funny.
- It's funny.

179
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,000
I like to do my own material.

180
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,000
That's as good as anything you do.

181
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,000
All right, I gotta make a call.
Everybody out. Come on.

182
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,400
- Why do we have to leave?
- I can't call a woman...

183
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,500
...with other people in the room.
- Oh, see?

184
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,100
This is the problem.

185
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,100
You're kicking me out of my house?

186
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,800
- Yes.
- Don't forget.

187
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,700
Right. Jerry,
do you have any apples?

188
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,900
Don't do the apples.

189
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,300
It's enough already with the apples.

190
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,700
Hi, it's Carol. I'll get back to you.

191
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,300
Hi! It's George.

192
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
George Costanza.
Remember me?

193
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
The guy who didn't come up
for coffee.

194
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,700
You see, I didn't realize
that coffee didn't really mean...

195
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,200
Well, whatever.

196
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,100
Anyway.

197
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,900
It was fun.

198
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,300
It was...

199
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,900
It was fun, so...

200
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,900
Oh, boy. So...

201
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,300
You call me back.

202
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,600
If you want.

203
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,600
That's up to you, you know.

204
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,500
Whatever you want to do.

205
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,700
Either way.

206
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,200
The ball's in your court.

207
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,100
So...

208
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,500
Take it easy.

209
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm just getting my jacket.
I'll meet you downstairs.

210
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,800
What's the matter?
Did you call?

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,400
Got her machine.

212
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,500
I'm dead. I'm a dead man. That's it,
I'm dead. I'm a dead man.

213
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,900
Dead man.

214
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,300
- What'd you say?
- I don't know what the hell I said.

215
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,500
I gave her an ultimatum, and there's
nothing I can do. It's a machine.

216
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,700
The little light's blinking right now.
"Come and listen to the idiot.

217
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,500
Hey, everybody, the idiot's on!"

218
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,800
After one date you try and improvise
on a machine?

219
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,100
Now I'm in the worst position of all.

220
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,900
My brother-in-law once left a message
on this guy's machine.

221
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,800
And he blurted out business
information he wasn't supposed to.

222
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,300
It would have cost him $15,000...

223
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
...so he waited outside
the guy's house.

224
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,600
When the guy came home, he went
with him and switched the tape.

225
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,600
- He did that?
- Yeah.

226
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,900
Somebody did that?

227
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,200
She'll call you back.
You're overreacting.

228
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
- Not once.
- Never?

229
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,800
I have never seen one episode
of I Love Lucy in my life ever.

230
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,600
- That's amazing.
- Thank you.

231
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,200
Anything else I should know?

232
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,500
Yes. I'm lactose intolerant.

233
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,900
- Really?
- I have no patience for lactose...

234
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,300
...and I won't stand for it.

235
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,700
I'll be right back.

236
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,900
Wait till you hear this.

237
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,300
I'm sorry. I had no idea...

238
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,600
Wait. Wait. He's in the bathroom.

239
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,800
I wanted to talk to him for a minute,
but I'll come back.

240
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,600
You don't have to leave.

241
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,300
- You sure?
- Yes.

242
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,900
Okay.

243
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,400
- I'm Donna.
- Donna.

244
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,200
You're the one that likes
that commercial!

245
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,000
He told you that?

246
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,500
No. He didn't actually tell me that.

247
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,500
We were talking about that
commercial. In fact...

248
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,200
...I think I brought it up because
I like that commercial. No.

249
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,700
He would never actually tell
me anything like that.

250
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,100
He never discusses anything. He's...

251
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,700
He's like a clam. You're not
gonna mention this to him...?

252
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,400
So you tell your friends I'm not hip
because I like that commercial.

253
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,700
What?

254
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,600
- What did you say?
- Say? What? Nothing.

255
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,200
You told him how I like
the commercial.

256
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,800
So what if I said that?

257
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,600
You didn't have to tell
your friends.

258
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,100
No, I had to tell my friends.
My friends didn't have to tell you.

259
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,000
Why'd you have to
get me in trouble?

260
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,400
I don't like you talking
about me behind my back.

261
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,800
- Oh, boy.
- I said I couldn't believe you liked...

262
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,400
...that commercial. So what?

263
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,400
I asked some friends this weekend,
all of them like the commercial.

264
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,000
Boy, I bet you got a regular
Algonquin Round Table there.

265
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,100
Hey.

266
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,700
Kramer, this is Donna.

267
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,400
- Cotton Dockers!
- Hello.

268
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,200
We should be going. Come on.

269
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,800
- What? Where are we going?
- Don't bother. I'm leaving.

270
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,300
You're making too much of this.

271
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,900
"One hundred percent
cotton Dockers.

272
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,400
If they're not Dockers,
they're just pants."

273
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,200
Kramer, please. Donna.

274
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,900
I don't wanna hear it.

275
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,800
I can't believe I said that.

276
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,600
You know me. I'm a vault.

277
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,700
Don't worry,
it wasn't working anyway.

278
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,400
- What happened there?
- I'll tell you later.

279
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,800
You're not gonna believe
what's going on with this woman.

280
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,300
You remember I made
the initial call Sunday.

281
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,700
She doesn't call back.

282
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,300
I call again Monday.

283
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,700
I leave another message.

284
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,000
I call Tuesday,
I get the machine again.

285
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,300
"I know you're there.
I don't know what your story is."

286
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,700
Yesterday, I'm a volcano.

287
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,600
I try one more call.

288
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,700
The machine comes on, and I let fly
like Mussolini from the balcony.

289
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,900
"Where the hell
do you get the nerve?

290
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,700
You invite me up for coffee, and then
you don't call me back for four days?

291
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,600
I don't like coffee.
I don't have to come up!

292
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,400
I'd like to get one more shot at the
coffee so I can spit it in your face!"

293
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,200
- You said that?
- I lost it.

294
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,800
I can't blame you. I can't believe
she never called you back.

295
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,500
She did.

296
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,700
Today.

297
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,000
- What?
- She called my office.

298
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,800
She said she's been
in the Hamptons since Sunday.

299
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,100
She didn't know if I was
trying to get in touch.

300
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,600
Her machine broke, and she's
been using her old machine.

301
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,000
And she doesn't have
the beeper for it.

302
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,000
- She didn't get the messages.
- Exactly. But they're on there waiting.

303
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,700
She can't wait to see me,
we're having dinner tonight.

304
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,000
She's supposed to call me
when she gets home.

305
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,200
But what about the messages?

306
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,700
Elaine's thing?

307
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,000
How you gonna get in?

308
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,500
I'll meet her outside the building.

309
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,800
But you know as soon as she gets
in, she's going for that machine.

310
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Unless she goes for the bathroom,
that's my only chance.

311
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,900
Who am I kidding?
I can't do this! I can't do this!

312
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't know how to work
the stupid machines.

313
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,600
There's nothing to it. You lift the lid.
It comes right out.

314
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,600
- You do it for me.
- What?

315
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,900
Come on. It'll be so much easier.

316
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,500
How are you gonna
get me up there?

317
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,200
I'll tell her I bumped into you.
I'm giving you a ride uptown.

318
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,500
- Who makes the switch?
- You do.

319
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,200
- I do.
- I can't do it.

320
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,900
I'll keep her busy.

321
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,100
I can't get involved in this.

322
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,400
I think I may be in love
with this woman.

323
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,200
What if she sees me?

324
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,900
You are such a wuss.

325
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,300
- A wuss?
- Yeah.

326
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,300
Did you call me a wuss?

327
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,900
Well, there is traffic.

328
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,200
It might take her till 8: 15.

329
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,400
I got one problem. You're keeping
her busy in the other room.

330
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,700
Now what if she somehow gets
away from you and is coming in?

331
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,600
You have to signal me
that she's coming.

332
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,500
A signal. Right.

333
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,900
Okay. The signal is...

334
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,700
...l'll call out "Tippy-toe!"

335
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,900
Tippy-toe?

336
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,400
I don't think so.

337
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,100
- You don't like tippy-toe?
- No tippy-toe.

338
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,600
All right.

339
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,200
Okay. I got it.

340
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,700
- I'll sing.
- What song?

341
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,100
"How Do You Solve
a Problem Like Maria?"

342
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,600
- What is that?
- It's a lovely song.

343
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,500
Got anything else?

344
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,800
You pick it.

345
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,800
- "Lemon Tree."
- Peter, Paul and Mary?

346
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,700
No. Trini Lopez.

347
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,000
Okay.

348
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,600
You got the tape?

349
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,800
Standard.

350
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,100
- Micro.
- How do you feel, confident?

351
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,500
- I feel good.
- Nervous?

352
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,000
Not at all.

353
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,500
Get up, get up. It's her.

354
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,200
To hell with this! I'm scared.
Walk away. Cancel everything.

355
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,800
Hey, what are you doing here?

356
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I was supposed to call you
when I got home.

357
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,300
I couldn't wait. I was too
anxious to see you.

358
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,000
That's so sweet.

359
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,300
This is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld.

360
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,800
I just bumped into him
around the corner.

361
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,300
Isn't that a coincidence?

362
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,800
The funny thing is,
I see him all the time.

363
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,700
- All the time.
- Nice to meet you.

364
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,100
Hi.

365
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
So I'm starving.
Where are we gonna eat?

366
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,000
You know, we could go uptown...

367
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,100
...and that way we can give
Jerry a ride home.

368
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,700
Okay. Let's go. I'm ready.
Where'd you park?

369
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,400
Don't you want to go upstairs first?

370
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,500
No. What for? I'll just give
my bag to the doorman.

371
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,200
You know...

372
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,400
...I really need to use the bathroom.

373
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,000
There's a bathroom in the
coffee shop just next door.

374
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,700
Yes. Yes.

375
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:10,900
- But I have to make a call, so...
- Well, they have a phone.

376
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,000
I know Jerry.

377
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,900
He has this phobia
about public toilets.

378
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,700
I think we really should go upstairs.

379
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,700
You know, I think I will go upstairs.

380
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,400
I can check my machine.

381
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,900
Right.

382
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,400
Right.

383
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,100
The bathroom's down the hall
to the right.

384
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,600
You know...

385
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,000
...why don't you go first?
You just had a long trip.

386
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,000
No, I'm fine.

387
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,700
You know, it's the damnedest thing.

388
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,700
It went away.

389
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,900
Well, that's weird.

390
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,800
No, no, that can happen. I've read
about that in medical journals.

391
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,400
It's a freak thing.

392
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,700
Let me just check my messages
and we'll go.

393
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,900
- Carol, could I talk to you right now?
- Sure.

394
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,100
Please, this is...
This is very important.

395
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,100
Tippy-toe! Tippy-toe!
Lemon tree!

396
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,200
Now I know who you are.
You're a comedian.

397
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
I've seen you.
It's been driving me crazy.

398
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,200
Right. I am.

399
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,300
Carol, that's so rude.

400
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,200
- Please, I'm serious.
- Okay.

401
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,000
Just for a moment,
if you wouldn't mind.

402
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,800
And then we'll talk to Jerry.

403
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,200
Hey, you two, I'm ready to go.

404
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,100
That's what you had to tell me?

405
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,200
Your father wears sneakers
in the pool?

406
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,700
Don't you find that strange?

407
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,500
Yes.

408
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,400
I'll just check my machine,
and we'll go.

409
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,900
No. Nothing here.
Let's go.

410
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,600
I forgot to tell you.

411
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,600
After I talked to you, my neighbour
called, played my messages to me.

412
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,900
Yours were hilarious.
We were both cracking up.

413
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,600
I just love jokes like that.

414
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,400
I love my phone machine.

415
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,400
I wish I was a phone machine.

416
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,000
If I saw somebody on the street
I didn't want to talk to, I could go:

417
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,600
"Excuse me. I'm not in right now.

418
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,700
If you could just leave a message,
I could walk away."

419
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,300
I also have a cordless phone,
but I don't like that as much.

420
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Because you can't slam down
a cordless phone.

421
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,200
You get mad at somebody
on a real phone:

422
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,700
"You can't talk to me like that."
Bang. You know.

423
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,200
Cordless phone.
"You can't talk to me like that."

424
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,600
I told him.

425
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,400
