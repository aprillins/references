1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,079
I love when the car place
puts that paper mat on the floor.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,038
Like they're so obsessed
with cleanliness.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,430
They don't even want their shoes
to touch the carpet.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,955
The mechanic comes out,
he looks like Al Jolson.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,795
He's covered in goo from head to toe.
You can't even see him.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,277
I prefer that to when they have the
lab coat, the clipboard, the glasses.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,396
Now you know
you're getting screwed.

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,949
"Can I see it?"

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,918
"You better not.
It's idling quietly right now.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,513
I think it should stay overnight.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,752
We want to keep an eye on it,
and want to keep the bill running up."

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,030
Tell the players that
I reimbursed the trainer...

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,679
...for the cigarettes and shakes.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,990
- The players will be reimbursed?
- The trainer.

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,957
Tell the players
I reimbursed the trainer.

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,430
This is the third time
I've had to repeat myself.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,352
- Sorry.
- Sorry doesn't cut it.

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,112
We're running
a ball club here, George.

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,157
You've got to pay attention.

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,594
I know. It won't happen again.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,479
Let me see.
I had an assignment for you.

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,993
Let me... Let me think here.

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,074
Elaine.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,514
Hi, Mr. Peterman.

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,116
You know what a huge fan
I am of John F. Kennedy.

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,793
I do.

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,315
The Peace Corps gave me
my start in this business.

28
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,711
Clothing the naked natives
of Bangtubesh.

29
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,359
The Pygmy pullover.

30
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,234
Sotheby's is having an auction
of JFK's memorabilia.

31
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,358
One item in particular
has caught my eye.

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,999
The presidential golf clubs.

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,712
To me, they capture that indefinable
romance that was Camelot.

34
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,869
Whatever.

35
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,235
Unfortunately, I will be
out of town with my lady...

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,311
...and therefore unable
to bid on the lot.

37
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,277
I was hoping you would go
in my stead.

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,193
Oh, yeah. I'd be happy to.

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,672
How much do you want this thing?
How high are you willing to go?

40
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,231
I would see no trouble in spending
up to, say, $10,000.

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,998
Have my secretary give you a check.

42
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,349
- when you're done, George,
and bring it directly to me.

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,353
Mr. Steinbrenner is
very interested in this.

44
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,431
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, George.

45
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,716
I want you to make this project
a top priority.

46
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,518
I will, sir. Top priority.

47
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,240
- Top priority, George.
- Top priority.

48
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,079
So he walks out of the stall.
He's been talking the whole time.

49
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,356
- He pulled an LBJ on you.
- LBJ?

50
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,875
Lyndon Johnson used to do that
to his staffers.

51
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,029
- No kidding?
- Oh, yeah.

52
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,111
He'd hold national security
meetings in there.

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,670
He planned the Hanoi bombing
after a bad Thai meal.

54
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,918
I don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,832
I don't even know
what my assignment is.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,070
Ask him to repeat it.
Tell him there was an echo.

57
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,549
I can't. He's been on me
about not paying attention.

58
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,790
It's too late.
I already told him I heard him.

59
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,789
You know what you do?
Ask him a follow-up question.

60
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,032
Tell him you're having trouble getting
started, and you want his advice.

61
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,879
Yeah, follow-up question.
That'll work.

62
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,315
- Hey, bud.
- Hey.

63
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,629
- Can I have my keys...
- Yeah.

64
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,869
- back please.

65
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,315
- You should have come, Jerry.
- We made quite a haul.

66
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,436
- Where did you go?
- Price Club.

67
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,319
- Why didn't you take your car?
- Oh, the steering wheel fell off.

68
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,675
I don't know where it is.

69
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,592
What are you doing?
Don't throw that away.

70
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,672
Well, I'm not paying the 5 cents
for that stupid recycling thing.

71
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,195
You don't pay 5 cents.
You get 5 cents back.

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,349
Read the label.

73
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,590
"Vermont, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, New York.

74
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,193
Refund, 5 cents."

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,554
- Refund?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,029
Well, what do you think
the hobos are doing?

77
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,873
I don't know. They're deranged.

78
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,995
Listen. Can you give me
a lift back to my place?

79
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,630
No, I can't. I've gotta pick up Elaine.
I'm taking her to this Kennedy auction.

80
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,995
- All right. I'll see you later.
- All right.

81
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,391
- What is this "MI, 10 cents"?
- That's Michigan.

82
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,073
In Michigan you get 10 cents.

83
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,434
- Ten cents?
- Yeah.

84
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,319
Wait a minute, you mean you get
5 cents here and 10 cents there?

85
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,710
You could round up bottles
and run them to Michigan.

86
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,552
- No, it doesn't work.
- What do you mean?

87
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,755
You get enough bottles...

88
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,912
You overload your inventory, and you
blow your margins on gasoline.

89
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,229
Trust me. It doesn't work.

90
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,960
You're not talking that Michigan
deposit-bottle scam?

91
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,111
- No, I'm off that.
- You tried it?

92
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,669
Oh, yeah. Every which way.
Couldn't crunch the numbers.

93
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,512
It drove me crazy.

94
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,113
You keep an eye on each other?

95
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,633
- No problem.
- You bet.

96
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,033
Are you sure you didn't hear
my car making a funny noise?

97
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,077
I know those two idiots did
something to it.

98
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,674
No, I didn't hear anything.

99
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,039
Oh, my God. Look who's here.

100
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,718
Sue Ellen Mischke, the braless,
Oh Henry! candy bar heiress.

101
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,874
Well, hello, Elaine, Jerry.

102
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,792
- Hi, Sue Ellen.
- Hi, Sue Ellen.

103
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,473
I'm surprised to see you here.

104
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,631
Come to catch a glimpse
of high society?

105
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,436
No, no, I'm actually here to bid,
Sue Ellen.

106
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,431
I mean,
that is if anything's to my liking.

107
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,748
I'm here to catch
a glimpse of high society.

108
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,514
Well, I hope you find something
that fits your budget.

109
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,592
I hate that woman.

110
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,029
I don't understand.

111
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,268
You fill an 18-wheeler.

112
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,079
No, an 18-wheeler's no good.
Too much overhead.

113
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,470
You got permits,
weigh stations, tolls.

114
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,471
Look, you're way out of your league.

115
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,598
I wanna learn.

116
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,228
I want to know why.

117
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,999
Oh, those are handsome.

118
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,593
Look at that set.

119
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,433
Yeah, think I might bid on those.

120
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,191
Lot number 745.

121
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,191
We have a full set of golf clubs...

122
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,828
...that were owned
by President John F. Kennedy...

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,834
...as seen in the famous photo of the
president chipping at Burning Tree...

124
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,911
...on the morning
of the Bay of Pigs Invasion.

125
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:08,677
The set is in perfect condition,
and we will start the biding at $4000.

126
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,434
Four thousand dollars?
Do I have $4000? I have $4000.

127
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,751
Do I have 5? Five thousand dollars?
I have $5000. Do I have 6?

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,434
Six thousand dollars
for this set of beautiful clubs.

129
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,115
Six? I have $6000.
Can I have 6500?

130
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,234
Sixty-five hundred
to the dark-haired person on the right.

131
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,076
We are at 6500.
Do I hear 6600?

132
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,310
The president's own golf clubs.

133
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,232
Leisure life at Camelot.

134
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,072
Sixty-five hundred going once.

135
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,549
Eight thousand.

136
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,396
Eight thousand. We have 8000.
The bid is now $8000.

137
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,073
What is she doing?

138
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,879
She's starting in on the biding now?

139
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,393
Eighty-five hundred.

140
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,120
- We have 85.
- Nine thousand.

141
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,952
Nine thousand dollars.

142
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,314
I think she wants those clubs.

143
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,835
Do I hear 95?
Ninety-five hundred.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,230
- Ninety-five hundred.
- Ten thousand.

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,037
Ten thousand
to the shapely woman on the left.

146
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,758
Ten thousand going once.

147
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,434
- That's you're ceiling.
- Ten thousand going twice.

148
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,830
- Eleven thousand.
- Twelve thousand.

149
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,629
- Thirteen thousand.
- Fourteen thousand.

150
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,275
Fifteen thousand.

151
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,512
Peterman is gonna kill me.

152
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,591
I really thought
you had her there at 17,000.

153
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,478
Why didn't you stop me?

154
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,834
Do you hear this clunking?

155
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,034
A little.

156
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,992
Oh, you know what?
I'm gonna grab these from you later.

157
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,628
You'll take care of them.
Okay? Okay.

158
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,153
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

159
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,880
- Alrighty. Bye.
- Bye.

160
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,110
What is going on here?

161
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,554
Oh, my God.

162
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,350
Oh, you idiots!

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,911
So we could put the bottles
in a U-Haul.

164
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,469
- Go lean and mean.
- Newman, it's a dead end. Come on.

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,194
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey.

166
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,590
You put your groceries under
the hood of my car?

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,672
Oh, that's right.
We forgot about those.

168
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,432
That's where my missing soda is.

169
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,750
And your crab legs?
And a thing of cheese?

170
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,071
The AAA guy said I was close to
sucking a muffin down the carburettor.

171
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,437
- What were you thinking?
- We ran out of space.

172
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,068
Now I gotta take the car to Tony
and get it checked out.

173
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,389
- He's good.
- He's real good.

174
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,391
But he's so obsessive
about the car.

175
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,915
He makes me feel guilty about
everything wrong with it.

176
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,799
I gotta get it washed before
I take it down or he'll yell at me.

177
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,157
- Choke?
- No, thank you.

178
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,790
Oh, yeah.

179
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,158
I remember this car. Beautiful car.

180
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,153
Yeah, so anyway, the engine's been
idling a little rough.

181
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,517
I thought it might be time
for a check-up.

182
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,432
There's nothing wrong on the inside.

183
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,591
The shift knob is loose.
You know about that?

184
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,399
- No, I hadn't noticed.
- Have you been picking at it?

185
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,309
Have I been picking at it?

186
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,115
No, you know,
it's just wear and tear.

187
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,589
Wear and tear, I see.

188
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,830
The engine's the only thing
that needs checking.

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,070
- You been rotating the tires?
- Try to.

190
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,673
You don't try to. You do it.

191
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,956
Fifty-one percent of all turns
are right turns.

192
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,793
That's right.

193
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,228
Twenty thousand dollars?

194
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,834
Elaine, that's twice the amount
I authorized you to spend.

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,309
I know, Mr. Peterman,
but once I saw them...

196
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,392
...I just couldn't stand to let anyone
else have them, you know.

197
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,596
Certainly not some
stuck-up candy-bar heiress...

198
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,876
...who flaunts herself in public
without regard...

199
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,076
Well, where are they?

200
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,033
They should be here today.

201
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,351
- Mr. Wilhelm.
- Yes, George.

202
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,316
Hi, I was just...

203
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,278
I just had one little question
about my assignment.

204
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,158
Well, I trust things are
moving smoothly.

205
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,833
Mr. Steinbrenner's counting on you.

206
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,071
Yes, yes, very smooth,
super smooth.

207
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,279
But I really want to attack this thing.
You know, sink my teeth into it.

208
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,396
So I was just wondering...

209
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,553
...what do you think would be
the very best way to get started?

210
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,188
Get started?
I don't understand, George.

211
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,555
- I was wondering...
- You haven't been to Payroll?

212
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,590
- No, I haven't done that.
- What's the problem?

213
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,718
Now, come on, George. I told
the big man you were moving on this.

214
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,552
Now, don't let him down!

215
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,432
Payroll!

216
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,392
Hello there.
I'm George Costanza.

217
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,595
Yes.

218
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,788
Assistant to the travelling secretary.

219
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,077
I'm working on the project.

220
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,592
- What project?
- The payroll project.

221
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,398
Wilhelm?

222
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,915
Big, big payroll project.

223
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,072
You're gonna have to fill me in.

224
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,791
You know what?
I'll look around for awhile.

225
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,679
- I'll just browse around.
- Hey, wait. Excuse me.

226
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,273
You can't come back here.

227
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,671
I'm under direct orders
from Mr. Wilhelm.

228
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,070
If you have a problem,
you just take it up with him.

229
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,709
Well, maybe I will.

230
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,159
You know what?
I urge you to take it up with him.

231
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,594
Go ahead. Give him a call.

232
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,194
He'll tell you what I'm doing here.
Then you can tell me.

233
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,715
Mr. Wilhelm,
this is Lafarge in Payroll.

234
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,112
There's a Costanza here,
says he's working on some project.

235
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,473
Oh, I see. Interesting.
Well, that's quite a project.

236
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,871
All right. Thank you.

237
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,951
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

238
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,313
Whatever you need,
just make yourself at home.

239
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,712
So he explained it all to you?

240
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,709
Yes, he explained it all very clearly.

241
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,634
- What did he tell you?
- Look, you were right, I was wrong.

242
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,711
You don't have
to humiliate me about it.

243
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,438
Damn.

244
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,280
Oh, Mother's Day.

245
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,559
Wait a second.

246
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,790
Mother's Day.

247
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,672
Yes!

248
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,230
Come on, Kramer!

249
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,155
- What?
- It's the truck, Kramer, the truck.

250
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,231
Look, Newman,
I told you to let this thing go.

251
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,628
No, no, no, listen to me.

252
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,189
Most days, the post office sends
one truckload of mail...

253
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,670
...to the second domestic regional
sorting facility in Saginaw, Michigan.

254
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,832
But on the week before holidays,
we see a surge.

255
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,638
On Valentine's Day,
we send two trucks.

256
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,109
On Christmas, four,
packed to the brim.

257
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,919
And tomorrow,
if history is any guide...

258
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,311
...we'll see some spillover
into a fifth truck.

259
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,792
- Mother's Day.
- The mother of all mail days.

260
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,633
And guess who's signed up
for the truck?

261
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,031
A free truck?

262
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,873
Oh, boy, that completely changes
our cost structure.

263
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,996
Our G and A goes down 50 percent.

264
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,435
We carry a couple of bags of mail,
the rest is ours!

265
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,478
Newman, you magnificent bastard,
you did it!

266
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,914
Let the collecting begin!

267
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,439
So did you go down to Payroll?

268
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,158
Yes, Payroll. Yes, I did.

269
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,754
Very productive. Payroll paid off.

270
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,388
Then I guess
you'll be heading downtown, huh?

271
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,314
Oh, yeah. Downtown, definitely.

272
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,835
I'm very interested
to see how this thing turns out.

273
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,675
You said it. Excuse me, Mr. Wilhelm,
do you really think...?

274
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,070
Well...

275
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,360
Is this downtown trip really necessary,
you know, for the project?

276
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,795
Oh, no, you've got
to go downtown, George.

277
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,951
It's all downtown.

278
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,112
- Just like the song says.
- The song?

279
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,354
There's your answer, "Downtown."

280
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,671
The song "Downtown"?
The Petula Clark song?

281
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,875
Yeah.

282
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,918
You're sure he didn't mention it
because you were going downtown?

283
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,277
I think he was trying to tell me
something, like it had some meaning.

284
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,114
Okay, so how does it go?

285
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,157
When you're alone
And life is making you lonely

286
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,754
You can always go

287
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,672
Downtown

288
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,794
Maybe you know
Some little places to go to

289
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,791
Where they never close

290
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,552
- Downtown
- Wait a second.

291
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,678
Little places to go that never close.
What little place never closes?

292
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,279
- 7-Eleven.
- Maybe.

293
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,228
Just listen to the music
Of the traffic in the city

294
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,836
Linger on the sidewalk
Where the neon lights are pretty

295
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,072
Where the neon lights are pretty.
The Broadway area?

296
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,071
No, that's midtown.

297
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,229
Midtown.

298
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,551
The lights are much brighter there

299
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,669
You can forget all your troubles
Forget all your cares

300
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,068
Just go

301
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,708
Downtown

302
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,395
Things will be great
When you're

303
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,278
Downtown

304
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,440
I got nothing, Jerry, nothing.

305
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,515
Well, don't hang around
and let your troubles surround you.

306
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,477
There are movie shows.

307
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,351
You think I should come clean?

308
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,511
What do you think?
You think I should confess?

309
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,557
How can you lose?

310
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,392
Yeah, Jerry,
it's Tony Abado at the shop.

311
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,357
Look, we gotta talk.
You better come down.

312
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,636
Anytime after 4.

313
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,999
- Hello.
- Hi, it's me.

314
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,878
- Oh, hi.
- Listen, I need to come over...

315
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,359
...and pick up the clubs.

316
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,990
- Oh, you know what?
- Oh, no. What?

317
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,436
No, it's no big deal.
I left the clubs in the car.

318
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,795
You left them in the car?

319
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,918
- How could you leave them in the car?
- I forgot.

320
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,798
Oh, go down and get them.

321
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,473
I can't.
The car's at the mechanic's.

322
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,193
Oh, this is great.

323
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,759
All right. Where's the mechanic?

324
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,512
I'll just go and pick them up myself.

325
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,910
No, no, you can't.
He's working on the car right now.

326
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,435
You cannot disturb him
while he's working.

327
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,834
I'm going there in an hour
if you wanna meet me there.

328
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,672
You know the place.
It's on 56th Street.

329
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,832
Oh, okay. All right. Fine.

330
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,679
Hey, Tony.

331
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,354
- Thanks for coming in, Jerry.
- Sure.

332
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,157
I think I know what's going on here,
and I just want to hear it from you.

333
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,276
But I want you
to be straight with me.

334
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,112
Don't lie to me, Jerry.

335
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,036
You know that motor oil
you're putting in there?

336
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,111
It's from those
quickie-lube places, isn't it?

337
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,956
- Well, I change it so often. I mean...
- Motor oil is the lifeblood of a car.

338
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,032
You put in a low-grade oil,
you can damage vital engine parts.

339
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,636
Okay, see this gasket?
I have no confidence in that gasket.

340
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,190
- Tony, I really don't...
- Here's what I wanna do.

341
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,476
I wanna overhaul the entire engine.

342
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,200
But it's gonna take
a major commitment from you.

343
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,033
You're gonna have to keep it under
60 miles an hour for awhile.

344
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,875
You gotta come in, and you gotta get
the oil changed every 1000 miles.

345
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,758
How much money is
this gonna cost me?

346
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,912
I don't understand you.

347
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,438
It's your own car
we're talking about.

348
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,195
You know, you wrote
the wrong mileage down on the form.

349
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,349
You barely know the car.

350
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,397
Don't know the mileage,
the tire pressure.

351
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,630
When's the last time you checked
the washer fluid?

352
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,519
- But the washer fluid is fine.
- The washer fluid is not fine!

353
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,310
You know what...

354
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,195
...I just wanna take my car and
I'm gonna bring it someplace else.

355
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,439
- What do you mean?
- Just can I have my car.

356
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,591
I'm gonna to pay my bill
and be on my way.

357
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,788
- Well, the car's on a lift.
- Well, just get it down.

358
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,713
All right.

359
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,034
Okay. Well, wait here and I'll...
I'll bring it around.

360
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,555
Okay. Thank you very much.

361
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,431
Hey, where's the car?

362
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,591
- He's bringing it.
- Good.

363
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,439
Okay. Thank you.

364
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,794
So, what did they say?

365
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,996
They're sending
a detective tomorrow.

366
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,754
What the hell were you thinking
leaving my clubs in that car?

367
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,117
Well, I didn't count on my mechanic
pulling a Mary Beth Whitehead, did I?

368
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,872
Well, what kind of maniac
is this guy?

369
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,031
He's a very special maniac.

370
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,120
- What do I tell Mr. Peterman?
- I don't know.

371
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,192
Why couldn't
you take better care of that car?

372
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,790
- Well, are they here?
- Mr. Peterman...

373
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,350
...there seems to be a bit of a snag.

374
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,515
Snag?

375
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:46,992
It seems that
a psychotic mechanic...

376
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,516
...has absconded
with my friend's car.

377
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,352
What does that have
to do with my clubs?

378
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,715
They happened to be
in the back seat at the time.

379
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,674
What was the suspect wearing
at the time of the incident?

380
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,436
You know, like mechanic's pants,
a shirt that said "Tony."

381
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,989
Let me ask you,
have you ever seen a case like this?

382
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,197
All the time. The mechanic forms
an emotional attachment...

383
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,909
...thinks he's gonna lose the car.
He panics and does something rash.

384
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,112
I'm gonna ask you
some personal questions.

385
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,317
I'm sorry if I touch a nerve,
but I think it will help with the case.

386
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,400
Had you been
taking good care of the car?

387
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,596
- Had I been taking...?
- Did you leave the AC on?

388
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,230
Do you zip over speed bumps?
Ride the clutch? Things like that?

389
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,109
What does it matter? It's my car.
I can do whatever I want with it.

390
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,798
Not that I would think
of doing such things.

391
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,669
All right, Mr. Seinfeld,
we'll let you know if we find anything.

392
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,558
I gotta be honest with you.

393
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,312
These cases never end up well.

394
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,640
Well, whatever you can do.
Thanks.

395
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,315
Mr. Wilhelm, about the project, sir.

396
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,959
That's what I came to talk about.

397
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,192
Great job, George.
You really nailed it.

398
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,436
- I did?
- Yes, I read through it this morning.

399
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,388
I couldn't have done it better myself.
I turned it over to Mr. Steinbrenner.

400
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,993
Good work, George.

401
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,989
I don't get it.

402
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,720
He assigns it to you,
you don't do it...

403
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,154
...somehow it gets done...

404
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,595
...and now he's telling you
what a great job you did.

405
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,274
Maybe somebody did it
and didn't take credit for it.

406
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,477
Maybe it was already done and
didn't need doing in the first place.

407
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,360
I have no idea who did it...

408
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,909
...what they did,
or how they did it so well.

409
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,274
And you know what?

410
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,352
Jimmy crack corn and I don't care.

411
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,716
The gardener did a nice job planting
the rose bushes, didn't he, dear?

412
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,758
You planted the rose bushes, dear.

413
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,590
- I did?
- Yesterday. You remember.

414
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,432
That's right.

415
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,354
- Oh, what's for dinner?
- We just ate.

416
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,432
Did you forget
to take your medicine?

417
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,240
The point is,
however it got done, it's done.

418
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,630
So any luck with the car?

419
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,028
No, the police have no leads.

420
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,634
And I just found out today
my insurance doesn't cover it.

421
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,597
- Why not?
- They don't consider it stolen...

422
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,830
...if you wilfully
give the guy the keys.

423
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,319
- Hey.
- Hey.

424
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,674
What did the detective say?

425
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,472
They're looking.

426
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,994
I gotta go.

427
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,479
- Hello.
- Mr. Seinfeld?

428
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,437
- Yeah.
- It's Detective McMahon.

429
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,478
I'm at the warehouse on pier 38.

430
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,078
I think you'd better get down here.

431
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,276
Yeah, okay.
They may have found the car.

432
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,119
Are the clubs in it? Ask him.

433
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,872
Are there golf clubs in the back?

434
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,190
We really can't tell.

435
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,193
You better bring
your service records.

436
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,513
Watch where you step.

437
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,195
There's quite a bit of grease.

438
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,952
Detective, Jerry Seinfeld is here.

439
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,512
How do you do?
Thanks for coming down.

440
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,318
This is Elaine Benes.

441
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,516
We used to date
but now we're just friends.

442
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,352
- I see.
- You know.

443
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,759
I'm sorry to make you go through this,
but we need to make sure.

444
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,512
What's going on?
What is this thing?

445
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,717
One of our patrolmen
stumbled over this.

446
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,029
Oh, my God.

447
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,596
The block is nearly split apart.

448
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,433
We found the overhead cams
30 feet away.

449
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,636
We can only hope
the body's sold for scrap.

450
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,393
Oh, my God.

451
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,039
And we know it's a Saab.

452
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,556
The angle on the V6
is definitely a '92.

453
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,679
The model is hard to determine
because the drive train is all burnt out.

454
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,791
What is that smell?

455
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,598
Look at the clutch.

456
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,352
Excuse me.

457
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,833
Whoever did this
didn't just dismantle it.

458
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,434
I mean, they took their time,
they had fun...

459
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,192
...they were very systematic.

460
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,920
They went out of the way
to gouge the sides of every piston.

461
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,469
And the turbo was separated
from the housing...

462
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,359
...and shoved right up
the exhaust pipe.

463
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,678
Wait a second. Turbo?

464
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,400
- I didn't have a turbo.
- Your car is not a turbo?

465
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,710
No, it's a 900 S.

466
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,235
It's a turbo, Elaine. A turbo.

467
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,879
It's a turbo!

468
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,793
Excuse me.
Did you say "Turbo"?

469
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,869
Saab Turbo 9000?

470
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,555
Is it midnight blue?

471
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,872
Yes, ma'am.

472
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,429
9999 bottles and cans in the truck

473
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,478
9999 bottles and cans

474
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,316
At $0. 10 a bottle and $0. 10 a can
We're pulling in $500 a man

475
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,711
9998 bottles and cans in the truck

476
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,838
9998 bottles and cans

477
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,434
We fill up with gas
We count up our cash

478
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,151
9997 bottles and cans in the truck

479
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,833
- Hello.
- Hey, Jerry. It's Tony.

480
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,429
Tony, where are you?

481
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,160
Oh, look, I just want you to know
that the car is fine.

482
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,514
Got her all fixed up.

483
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,717
We're in a nice area,
no potholes, no traffic.

484
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,871
So there's nothing
to worry about, okay?

485
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,359
In fact, here.

486
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,715
Somebody wants to talk to you.

487
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,994
Tony, you better
bring that car back.

488
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,673
Nobody's giving anything back.

489
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,114
You tried to take it from me.

490
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,474
I don't forget that.

491
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,108
Tony, it is my car,
and I want it back.

492
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,555
Oh, your car?
You want your car back?

493
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,193
- Tony...
- Listen.

494
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,590
That registration may have
your name on it, Jerry...

495
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,594
...but this engine's running
on my sweat and my blood.

496
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,715
Where do I find these guys?

497
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,514
- How much gas we got?
- Three quarters of a tank.

498
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,234
Better than we estimated.

499
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,670
- Seven dollars and 22 cents better.
- Oh, baby.

500
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,549
- Maybe we could stop for a snack.
- No, that's not in the budget.

501
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,469
Well, the budget changed, you know.
I mean, it might be a good investment.

502
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,154
That's not a good investment.
That's a loss.

503
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,513
Hey, you see that car?

504
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,196
It looks like Jerry's.

505
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,396
I'm gonna check out
that license plate.

506
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,232
Yeah, those are New York plates.

507
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,231
- Is that Jerry's number?
- I don't know.

508
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,154
But that's New York and we're in Ohio.
Those are pretty good odds.

509
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,833
- What are you doing?
- Calling Jerry.

510
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,117
- On what?
- I brought my phone.

511
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,068
- Hello.
- Hey, Jerry.

512
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,310
- What's your license plate number?
- What's up?

513
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,118
Yeah, well,
I think I spotted your car.

514
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,272
Oh, my God, you're kidding.
Hang on a second.

515
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,276
- It's JVN728.
- Hey, that's it.

516
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,510
That's it.
Hey, look, we got him.

517
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,238
We're driving behind him
in a truck.

518
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,914
Oh, my God. Yeah.
He said he brought it to the country.

519
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,196
We're in the country,
and we're right on his tail.

520
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,112
Good work, Kramer.
This is incredible.

521
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,429
Yeah, don't worry, Jerry.

522
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,353
We're right on this guy
like stink on a monkey.

523
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,351
I'll check back with you.

524
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,114
Elaine Benes.

525
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,998
Yeah, it's me.
Kramer found the car.

526
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,754
Oh, my God. Where is it?

527
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,876
Somewhere in the country.
They're following him.

528
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,515
- The clubs there?
- I don't know. They're tailing him.

529
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,036
- I'm waiting for them to call me back.
- All right. I'm heading over right now.

530
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,188
- What's the status?
- Last check-in, they were still on him.

531
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,953
Have they called the police yet?

532
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,156
- They won't call the police.
- What? Why not?

533
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,117
They'll get in trouble
for using the truck.

534
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,350
- Kramer doesn't want a record.
- Kramer has one.

535
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,873
Not a federal record.

536
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,269
- Kramer?
- Kramer?

537
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,793
- What's going on?
- Yeah, nothing.

538
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,154
We're still following him.

539
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,830
Wait a second. He's getting off.

540
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,309
Yeah, he's gonna be going south
on the 135.

541
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,914
- Keep following him.
- All right. I'll follow him.

542
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,718
We can't.
We're going north to Michigan.

543
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,317
Yeah, hey, listen, I can't.
It's gonna be taking us out of our way.

544
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,114
- I need those clubs.
- Kramer, I want my car.

545
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,192
- Well, I don't know what to do!
- We got 10,000 deposit bottles here.

546
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,998
This guy could be going
to Arkansas.

547
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,679
Keep following.
Don't let me down.

548
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,718
We can't afford a detour.
Our budget won't hold it.

549
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,279
I don't know what to do, man!

550
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,874
Stay left! Stay left!
Left, left, left. Stay left!

551
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,393
- Right! Go right!
- Go south!

552
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,393
All right, all right. I'm getting off.
I'm gonna go on the ramp.

553
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,232
I hope you realize
what you've done.

554
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,277
You've destroyed
our whole venture.

555
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,953
This ramp is steep.

556
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,317
All my work, my planning, my genius,
all for naught.

557
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,833
We're pulling too much weight.

558
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,594
- He's getting away. Take the wheel.
- Hey, what are you doing?

559
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,399
- I'm gonna get something.
- Are you crazy?

560
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,992
Keep your foot on the gas.

561
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,639
Hey, you're not dumping those
bottles back there, are you?

562
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,752
Kramer, those have wholesale value.
We can cut our losses.

563
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,354
Bottles below!

564
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,118
I love this magnifying glass.
I feel like a scientist.

565
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,555
- Oh, yeah.
- You wanted to see me, sir?

566
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,111
Come in, George. Come in.

567
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,556
Wilhelm gave me
this project you worked on.

568
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,358
- Yes, sir.
- Let me ask you something.

569
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,318
Having any personal problems?
Girl trouble? Love trouble?

570
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,832
- No, sir.
- What about drugs?

571
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,116
Doing some of that crack cocaine?
You on the pipe?

572
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,231
- No, sir.
- Are you seeing a psychiatrist?

573
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,039
I got a flash for you, young man.
You're non compos mentis.

574
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,918
You got some bats in the belfry.

575
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,388
What are you talking about?

576
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,398
George, I read this report.
It's troubling. Very troubling indeed.

577
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,949
It's a sick mind at work here.
Okay, come on, boys.

578
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,917
Come in here.
George, this is Herb and Dan.

579
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,389
They're gonna take you
to where you can get some help.

580
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,994
Very friendly people there.
My brother-in-law was there.

581
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,752
Man was obsessed
with lactating women.

582
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,990
They cured him.
Although he eats a lot of cheese.

583
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,072
But you see... You see, I didn't
write that report. That's not mine.

584
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,071
Of course you didn't.
You didn't write it.

585
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,515
I didn't do it! It just got done!

586
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,035
I don't know how it got done
but it did!

587
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,315
Of course, it got done.

588
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,596
Things get done all the time.
I understand.

589
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,115
Your job will be waiting for you
when you get back.

590
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,238
Get better, George!
Get better!

591
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,151
Man, I don't understand this.

592
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,073
I ditched every bottle and can,
and we still can't gain.

593
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,832
It's like we're...

594
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,392
...sluggish.

595
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,269
We collected all those bottles and
all those cans for what? What a waste.

596
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,034
I'm really gonna catch hell
for those missing mailbags.

597
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,392
Hey, wasn't that a pie stand
back there?

598
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,399
- A pie stand?
- Oh, yeah.

599
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,391
Homemade pies, 200 yards back.

600
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,676
Oh, come on, pull over.
Pull over, will you?

601
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,954
Where? I don't see it.

602
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,998
Well, open the door.
You'll get a better look.

603
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,832
I don't see any pie.

604
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,234
Kramer!

605
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,631
I'm sorry, Newman,
you were holding us back.

606
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,358
Kramer!

607
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:57,716
Jerry, we've lost the fat man
and we're running lean.

608
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,871
We're back on track, buddy.

609
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,871
Federal employee.

610
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,952
I hate corn.

611
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,599
- Hello, stranger.
- Look, I'm sorry to bother you...

612
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,239
...but I'm a U.S. postal worker...

613
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,311
...and my mail truck
was just ambushed...

614
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,358
...by a band of backwoods,
mail-hating survivalists.

615
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,033
You just calm down now.
Calm down.

616
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,872
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

617
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,237
This farm ain't much,
but you're welcome to what we have.

618
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,791
- Hot bath, hearty meal, clean bed.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

619
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,439
I just have one rule.

620
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,795
Keep your hands off my daughter.

621
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,119
Jerry, we got him.
I'm riding his tail.

622
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,874
There's no escape.
He's running scared, buddy.

623
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,918
- How's the gas situation?
- I got enough to get to Memphis.

624
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,959
He's reaching in back.

625
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,873
Keeps grabbing at something.
He's pulling out a gun.

626
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,235
- He's got a gun, Jerry!
- Duck, Kramer, duck.

627
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,431
It's a golf club. There's no gun.

628
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,716
He threw a golf club at me!

629
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,632
Those are JFK's golf clubs.

630
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,028
Hey, I'm under fire.

631
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,236
I'm under heavy fire here.

632
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,191
Jeez, there goes a five-iron.

633
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,152
Stop the truck, Kramer.
Pick up the clubs.

634
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,039
No, don't stop, Kramer.
Keep going. Don't let him get away.

635
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,475
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I think he's done.

636
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,437
Oh, no, he's taking out the woods!

637
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,390
You'll have to do
a lot better than that!

638
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,832
What's happening?

639
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,038
This truck is dying.
We're losing him.

640
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,032
- I think we lost him.
- Damn it.

641
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,111
Can you stop
and pick up those clubs, Kramer?

642
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,556
Yeah, yeah, I'll get them.

643
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,157
Enjoying that mutton?

644
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,954
It's delicious mutton.

645
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,839
This is... This is out of sight.

646
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,039
I would... I would love to get the recipe.
It's very good.

647
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,079
That cider too strong for you?

648
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,437
No, no, I love strong cider.

649
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,479
I'm a big strong-cider guy.

650
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,473
Gonna milk the Holsteins
in the morning, if you'd lend a hand.

651
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,319
You know, I don't know much about...
I don't have any...

652
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,040
- I don't think I know much about that.
- Susie will teach you.

653
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,711
Just gotta pull on the teets a little.

654
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,598
It's nice having
a big, strong man around.

655
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,555
You know, those mailbags,
they get mighty heavy.

656
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,354
I...

657
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,590
I Nautilus, of course.

658
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,877
Can I have some gravy?

659
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,713
Steinbrenner had me committed!
I'm in the nuthouse.

660
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,791
I'll be back
same time next week, Pop.

661
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,598
They took my belt, Jerry.

662
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,239
I got nothing to hold my pants up.

663
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,031
You gotta come over here now!

664
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,158
Just tell him what we talked about,
how I didn't do the project.

665
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,833
George?

666
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,032
I see you're finally
getting some help.

667
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,193
Oh, Deena, thank God.
Thank God, you're here.

668
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,634
Listen, you gotta help me.

669
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,677
You gotta tell these people
that I'm okay.

670
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,115
You know
that I don't belong in here.

671
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,632
George, this is
the best thing for you.

672
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,831
What? No, no, Deena.
Deena, wait! Deena, help!

673
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,194
It's not what it looks like.

674
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,316
Is that little Georgie C?

675
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,752
How's the folks?

676
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,229
You still got that nice little car?

677
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,030
- What are you doing?
- Kramer, help me, help me!

678
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,111
I told you to keep away
from my daughter.

679
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,072
No, Daddy, you'll hurt him.

680
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,912
I love him.

681
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,392
Goodbye, Norman! Goodbye!

682
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,828
Elaine, you found the clubs.
That's wonderful news.

683
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,116
- Where are they?
- Yep.

684
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,272
Let me get them for you,
Mr. Peterman.

685
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,796
I'll be inaugurating them this weekend
with none other than Ethel Kennedy.

686
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,671
A woman whose triumph
in the face of tragedy...

687
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,196
...is exceeded only
by her proclivity to procreate.

688
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,759
The...

689
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,359
The letter of authenticity
is in the side pocket there.

690
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,953
Elaine.

691
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,790
I never knew Kennedy
had such a temper.

692
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,752
Oh, yeah.

693
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,273
The only thing worse was his slice.

694
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:20,430
- See you on Monday.
- Have a good game.
