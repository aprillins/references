1
00:00:02,367 --> 00:00:03,629
So I went to a fashion show.

2
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:07,262
The concept of modeling
is counterproductive...

3
00:00:07,438 --> 00:00:08,632
...to the fashion industry.

4
00:00:08,806 --> 00:00:11,570
Because when these women
are around, who's looking at clothes?

5
00:00:11,743 --> 00:00:14,541
I didn't notice any of the clothes.
We're all applauding. Yeah.

6
00:00:14,712 --> 00:00:17,272
What are we applauding?
"There's great-looking women here.

7
00:00:17,448 --> 00:00:18,574
This is great.

8
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,378
I'm glad I'm here with all
these great-looking women."

9
00:00:21,553 --> 00:00:22,781
Anybody can design a shirt.

10
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:27,391
It takes talent to get all these girls
in one spot. That's talent.

11
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:30,153
What is this goofy walk
that the models do?

12
00:00:30,328 --> 00:00:32,796
You know this walk
that they do down the runway?

13
00:00:32,964 --> 00:00:34,329
Like they have to go somewhere.

14
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:38,026
They're walking like they're really
on the way somewhere.

15
00:00:38,202 --> 00:00:40,966
Then they get to the end,
and it's like:

16
00:00:41,172 --> 00:00:43,572
"Well, I guess I'll just go back."

17
00:00:49,247 --> 00:00:51,340
I loved her, Jerry. I loved her.

18
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:52,744
No, you didn't.

19
00:00:53,484 --> 00:00:57,648
- And she loved me. She really did.
- No, she didn't.

20
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:03,987
What am I gonna do now?
I can't live without Susan.

21
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:07,859
I gotta get her back. How?
How am I gonna to get her back?

22
00:01:08,032 --> 00:01:10,762
Not only didn't you love her,
you didn't even like her!

23
00:01:12,503 --> 00:01:15,529
- Who says?
- You did!

24
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:20,171
A beautiful, successful, intelligent
woman's in love with me.

25
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:23,906
And I throw it all away.
Oh, boy.

26
00:01:24,082 --> 00:01:26,676
Now I'll spend the rest
of my life living alone.

27
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:29,513
I'll sit in my disgusting
little apartment...

28
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:32,679
...watching basketball games,
eating Chinese takeout...

29
00:01:32,857 --> 00:01:36,793
...walking around with no underwear
because I'm too lazy to do the laundry.

30
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:40,127
You walk around
with no underwear?

31
00:01:41,566 --> 00:01:43,500
What do you do when
you run out of laundry?

32
00:01:43,668 --> 00:01:45,829
I do a wash.

33
00:01:48,506 --> 00:01:50,497
Who am I gonna meet
that's better than her?

34
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:52,609
No one, Jerry.
No one's better than her.

35
00:01:52,777 --> 00:01:55,245
When you were with her,
you said you couldn't stand her.

36
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:57,313
I loved her.

37
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:59,541
You said going up the steps
to her apartment...

38
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:01,344
...was like being taken to a cell.

39
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,920
I would give anything to be going
up those stairs again.

40
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:06,852
I gotta call her. Should I call her?

41
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:08,822
I don't know if that's
such a good idea.

42
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:11,359
- Why?
- You need some professional advice.

43
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:13,997
Why don't you go see
Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.

44
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:16,725
I'm not gonna see that nut doctor
she went to Europe with.

45
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:19,870
No, no. Elaine, what's the name
of that friend of yours...

46
00:02:20,038 --> 00:02:21,903
...that's a therapist? The woman.

47
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:23,836
- Dana Foley.
- Right. Dana Foley.

48
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:25,908
- She any good?
- Yeah, she's terrific.

49
00:02:26,077 --> 00:02:28,170
Why? You thinking of going?

50
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,838
Tia? Who's that?

51
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,911
It's that model I met on the plane.

52
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,186
She sent you a Christmas card?

53
00:02:40,324 --> 00:02:42,849
And we're going out Saturday night.

54
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:47,361
My darling, Susan. My darling!

55
00:02:47,532 --> 00:02:49,796
- What are you doing?
- Date with Fred.

56
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:53,027
- The religious guy?
- He's not that religious.

57
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:55,936
Let us pray.

58
00:02:57,909 --> 00:02:59,968
- You got any Double Crunch?
- Yeah.

59
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:01,771
Kramer, should I call Susan?

60
00:03:01,946 --> 00:03:04,312
Now, what does the little man
inside you say?

61
00:03:04,482 --> 00:03:07,212
See, you gotta listen
to the little man.

62
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:11,620
- My little man doesn't know.
- The little man knows all.

63
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:14,223
My little man's an idiot.

64
00:03:16,027 --> 00:03:17,255
See, she was clever.

65
00:03:17,428 --> 00:03:20,591
She put her picture on her card.
I never do anything like that.

66
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:22,892
You want a picture on a card.
I can do that.

67
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:26,798
She kept such a nice, clean
apartment. She was so sanitary.

68
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:29,769
No. I was thinking out loud.
I don't want my picture on a card.

69
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:32,068
I'll take it.
I'll take care of everything.

70
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:34,302
She made a big breakfast
every Sunday.

71
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,470
I don't know what
she put in those eggs.

72
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:40,380
You come on over. I'll have my
cereal, and I'll take your picture.

73
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:42,143
Really? Can you take a picture?

74
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,618
He takes good pictures.
He's got equipment there.

75
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:46,222
- All right.
- Yeah.

76
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,257
- I don't know about that outfit, though.
- What's wrong with it?

77
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:51,395
Well, we'll have to improvise.

78
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:56,992
Oh, hey

79
00:03:57,368 --> 00:04:00,132
If you happen to see

80
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:04,069
The most beautiful girl

81
00:04:04,675 --> 00:04:07,473
Who walked out on me

82
00:04:08,446 --> 00:04:11,973
Tell her I'm sorry

83
00:04:13,217 --> 00:04:17,347
Tell her I need my baby

84
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:20,787
Won't you tell her

85
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:24,453
That I love her?

86
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:28,729
- Oh, hey...
- George.

87
00:04:29,534 --> 00:04:32,503
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

88
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:38,141
So I'm thinking of putting in
a tropical-fish tank right here.

89
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:41,039
Are sure you're ready
for that kind of commitment?

90
00:04:41,212 --> 00:04:44,340
Well, if it doesn't work out,
I can flush them down the toilet.

91
00:04:44,515 --> 00:04:45,914
That's horrible.

92
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,607
What's the perfume you're wearing?

93
00:04:47,785 --> 00:04:50,185
Oh, I completely forgot.
I want you to see this.

94
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:53,414
That Calvin Klein ad I was telling
you about came out today.

95
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:55,422
- What is that smell?
- It's here somewhere.

96
00:04:55,593 --> 00:04:58,858
- It smells like the beach.
- Exactly.

97
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,022
- Oh, my God. Is that the new perfume?
- Yeah.

98
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,398
I can't believe this. My neighbor had
the idea for this perfume last year.

99
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:09,938
He met with a Calvin Klein executive.
I can't believe they stole his idea.

100
00:05:10,107 --> 00:05:13,838
- Are you sure?
- And you're the model for this perfume?

101
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,307
That's him. He just came home.

102
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:20,313
I'll lock the door.

103
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:22,343
Hey.

104
00:05:23,354 --> 00:05:24,685
Hey.

105
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:27,691
Hey, how you doing?

106
00:05:30,528 --> 00:05:32,428
Yeah, I'll see you later.

107
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:35,725
I just wanted to borrow
your DustBuster.

108
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:39,298
All right, come on in.

109
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:42,271
- Just wait over here.
- What?

110
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,271
Just wait here,
and I'll get it for you.

111
00:05:44,775 --> 00:05:47,209
- Kramer, this is Tia.
- Hello.

112
00:05:54,218 --> 00:05:56,152
- How tall are you?
- 5'10".

113
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,788
Let's see. Come on. Back to back.

114
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:01,354
- No, Kramer!
- What?

115
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:03,823
What's the matter? I wanted
to see how tall she was.

116
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:07,590
You're tall. She's tall. I'm tall.
What's the difference? We're all tall.

117
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:09,255
- What's that?
- What?

118
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:12,129
- That smell. What's that smell?
- What smell?

119
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:15,771
It's very familiar. I can't put
my finger on it. It's familiar.

120
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,465
Oh, they're all the same.
Here. Now, if you'll excuse us.

121
00:06:18,643 --> 00:06:20,338
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:20,511 --> 00:06:22,308
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you too.

123
00:06:23,915 --> 00:06:26,008
Yeah, I'll see you later.

124
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:29,346
That was close.

125
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,317
The beach!

126
00:06:32,256 --> 00:06:34,986
You smell like the beach.
What's that perfume you're wearing?

127
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:37,650
- It's Ocean by Calvin Klein.
- Calvin Klein?

128
00:06:37,828 --> 00:06:40,661
No. No, that's my idea.
They stole my idea.

129
00:06:40,831 --> 00:06:43,629
I had the idea of a cologne that
made you smell like the beach.

130
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:45,632
I know. Look at this.

131
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,939
That's you. What is going on here?

132
00:06:51,108 --> 00:06:53,736
The jerk! He laughs at me.
Then he steals my idea!

133
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:55,242
I could've been a millionaire.

134
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:58,473
I could have been
a fragrance millionaire, Jerry.

135
00:06:59,317 --> 00:07:01,046
They're not gonna
get away with this.

136
00:07:05,923 --> 00:07:10,189
Hello, George. Come in, come in.
I've heard an awful lot about you.

137
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:13,057
- Please sit down.
- Well, hello.

138
00:07:13,364 --> 00:07:15,924
Specifically, the reason
that I'm here...

139
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,092
I don't know what
Elaine told you, but...

140
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,171
...I broke up with my girlfriend
a couple of weeks ago.

141
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,036
Actually, she broke up
with me, and...

142
00:07:25,209 --> 00:07:27,700
Well, I was the cause of it, and...

143
00:07:27,878 --> 00:07:30,779
I just wanted to find out from you...

144
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:32,313
What's with this thing?

145
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:35,748
- So she broke up with you.
- Yeah, and...

146
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:38,655
Why won't this go down?

147
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:40,791
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

148
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,323
So why'd she break up with you?

149
00:07:42,493 --> 00:07:45,053
What is with this damn zipper?

150
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:48,164
It doesn't matter. Fix it later.
Tell me about your girlfriend.

151
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:51,634
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here.

152
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:53,030
I can't get the cloth out.

153
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:55,138
- It doesn't matter...
- This is a new jacket.

154
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:58,298
Boy, this really burns me up.

155
00:07:59,176 --> 00:08:02,339
George. George, look at me.

156
00:08:02,513 --> 00:08:04,413
Okay, forget about the zipper.

157
00:08:06,684 --> 00:08:08,174
What's your girlfriend's name?

158
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:11,919
- Susan.
- Okay, we're getting somewhere.

159
00:08:13,424 --> 00:08:19,158
It's just so frustrating. It's a
brand-new jacket for crying out loud.

160
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:30,034
So Fred and I are gonna do volunteer
work for that church on Amsterdam.

161
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,574
Volunteer work. See, that's what I love
about the holiday season.

162
00:08:33,744 --> 00:08:35,507
That's the true spirit
of Christmas.

163
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,206
People being helped
by people other than me.

164
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:43,549
That makes me feel good inside.

165
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:47,122
Oh, look at what we have here.

166
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,055
A Christmas card from Lainey.

167
00:08:50,861 --> 00:08:54,058
Thank you. You didn't have to
go to that trouble.

168
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:56,631
It was no trouble.
My assistant did the whole thing.

169
00:08:56,801 --> 00:08:59,736
- How'd the picture come out?
- Oh, you know. It's a picture.

170
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:02,566
Oh, look at that. Looks good.
Kramer did a good job.

171
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,799
Yeah, well, how hard is it
to take a picture?

172
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:10,078
- What?
- Did you look at this picture carefully?

173
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:11,575
Carefully?

174
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:16,812
Because I'm not sure,
and correct me if I'm wrong...

175
00:09:16,987 --> 00:09:19,854
...but I think I see a nipple.

176
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:26,728
- What?
- Here, take a look. What is that?

177
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:28,956
Oh, my God!

178
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,959
That's my nipple!

179
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:36,128
- That's what I thought.
- That's my nipple! My nipple's exposed!

180
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:39,801
I sent this card
to hundreds of people.

181
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:45,271
My parents. My boss.
Nana and Papa.

182
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:48,111
- Didn't you look at the picture?
- Oh, God, I didn't notice.

183
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:51,743
What am I gonna do? You know,
your whole life, you go through...

184
00:09:51,922 --> 00:09:55,085
...painstaking efforts to hide
your nipple, and then boom.

185
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:58,285
Suddenly hundreds of people
get their own personal shot of it.

186
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,859
Hey.

187
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,532
- Have you seen the card?
- What card?

188
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:07,796
- My Christmas card.
- Yeah. Of course, I took it.

189
00:10:07,972 --> 00:10:09,872
Did you notice
anything unusual about it?

190
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,634
- No.
- Well, come here and take a look.

191
00:10:13,844 --> 00:10:15,744
- Yeah, so?
- So, what's that?

192
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:18,245
- That's a nipple.
- Right.

193
00:10:22,753 --> 00:10:27,053
- Oh, great. Didn't you see that?
- No, I didn't notice it.

194
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:29,488
It's because you made me wear
that stupid shirt.

195
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,128
Well, maybe no one noticed it.
You didn't notice it.

196
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:35,663
- Let's see if Newman sees it.
- No, I don't want him looking.

197
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,994
What's the difference?
Everybody else has it.

198
00:10:38,169 --> 00:10:39,534
Give me that.

199
00:10:39,703 --> 00:10:43,104
Oh, my God, I sent one to the
super in my building, my mailman.

200
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:44,707
My 10-year-old little nephew.

201
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:50,279
Sister Mary Catherine, Father Chelios.
Oh, my God, Fred. I sent one to Fred.

202
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:53,439
- Okay, what is it?
- Here.

203
00:10:53,617 --> 00:10:56,677
Take a look at this card. Tell me
if you notice anything unusual.

204
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:59,482
Yeah, your nipple's showing.

205
00:11:01,158 --> 00:11:02,557
Okay, thanks.

206
00:11:02,726 --> 00:11:03,954
- Anything else?
- No.

207
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:06,153
All right. See you later.

208
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:10,600
What? So what?

209
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:12,732
It's a nipple.

210
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,302
It's a little brown,
circular protuberance.

211
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:19,540
What's the big deal?

212
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,611
Everybody's got them.
Look, I got them.

213
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,571
- I got them too.
- Look at this.

214
00:11:26,483 --> 00:11:29,384
Everybody's got them.

215
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:33,481
See, it's kind of gotta little piece of
cloth that's stuck underneath and...

216
00:11:33,657 --> 00:11:35,284
Well, can you pull it up a bit?

217
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,856
Well, here you hold it.
Wait, hold it. Hold it.

218
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:41,554
Damn it. I can't move it.

219
00:11:41,732 --> 00:11:43,563
God, I've never seen
a zipper so stubborn.

220
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:45,563
Damn it. I almost had it.

221
00:11:45,736 --> 00:11:47,601
Okay. Wait, that'll separate it.

222
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:49,398
- Let me try.
- Take it off the track.

223
00:11:49,573 --> 00:11:51,905
You're gonna rip it.
You're gonna rip it.

224
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:58,312
I'm afraid we're
gonna have to stop now.

225
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:01,474
Okay.

226
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:05,781
My mother is gonna pay
for the session.

227
00:12:07,258 --> 00:12:09,249
Oh, is this Elaine?

228
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:10,791
Yeah.

229
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,103
No!

230
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:33,316
No!

231
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:35,315
No. Oh, no.

232
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:45,524
I've called every day for four days.
She hasn't returned one call.

233
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,655
Was it a scratch...

234
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,165
...or a pick?

235
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:53,702
It was a scratch.

236
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:56,499
Hey, it's me.

237
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:01,205
Don't you think I know the difference
between a pick and a scratch?

238
00:13:04,982 --> 00:13:06,415
- Yeah.
- It's me.

239
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,880
Come on up.

240
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:12,045
Was there any
nostril penetration?

241
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,055
There may have been some
incidental penetration...

242
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:19,718
...but from her angle, she was
in no position to make the call.

243
00:13:20,564 --> 00:13:24,193
So let's say, in her mind,
she witnessed a pick.

244
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:27,201
- Okay, so then what?
- Is that so unforgivable?

245
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:28,998
Is that like breaking
a commandment?

246
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:31,869
Did God say to Moses,
"Thou shalt not pick"?

247
00:13:32,042 --> 00:13:35,068
I guarantee you
Moses was a picker.

248
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:40,049
You wander through the desert
for 40 years with that dry air.

249
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:48,321
You telling me you're not gonna have
occasion to clean house a little?

250
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,085
Let me ask you something.
If you were dating somebody...

251
00:13:52,262 --> 00:13:54,856
...and she did that, would you
continue going out with her?

252
00:13:55,032 --> 00:13:57,500
No. That's disgusting.

253
00:13:59,703 --> 00:14:02,638
You cannot believe
what I am going through.

254
00:14:02,806 --> 00:14:05,400
That card is plastered
all over the office.

255
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:07,806
Everybody's calling me "Nip."

256
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,243
Yeah, that's my new nickname
at the office. Nip.

257
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,578
These guys keep asking
me out for drinks.

258
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:18,313
Not only that. Fred, you know,
the guy I told you about...

259
00:14:18,489 --> 00:14:20,389
...he hasn't called me in three days.

260
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:23,253
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

261
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:25,725
How come I didn't get
a Christmas card?

262
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:27,989
Everybody else got one.

263
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:30,292
Jerry got one. Kramer got one.

264
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:33,925
I thought we were good friends. I don't
get a Christmas card. I don't get it.

265
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:37,198
You want a Christmas card? You want
a Christmas card? All right, here.

266
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:39,103
Here's your Christmas card.

267
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:52,389
You got any Double Crunch?

268
00:14:52,556 --> 00:14:54,615
Yeah, I think I do.

269
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:02,491
- What's that perfume?
- It's the ocean.

270
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,793
That's mine. That's my smell.

271
00:15:04,968 --> 00:15:08,096
Jerry, get that model to get me an
appointment with Calvin Klein.

272
00:15:08,272 --> 00:15:09,933
I can't. She won't return my calls...

273
00:15:10,107 --> 00:15:12,268
...because she caught me
in a pick at a light.

274
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:16,469
- I thought you said it was a scratch.
- That's not what she thinks.

275
00:15:16,647 --> 00:15:19,980
Call her agency. Maybe she's been
out of town and didn't get the calls.

276
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,549
Get it.

277
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:23,746
All right.

278
00:15:23,987 --> 00:15:26,649
I'll call the agency.

279
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:33,122
Hello.

280
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:35,288
I'm trying to get in touch
with Tia Van Kamp.

281
00:15:35,466 --> 00:15:37,525
Do you know if she's been in town?

282
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:39,430
Oh, really?

283
00:15:39,603 --> 00:15:41,537
- Well, thank you very much.
- What?

284
00:15:41,705 --> 00:15:44,572
She has been in town.
She's at Calvin Klein right now.

285
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:46,936
Let's go.

286
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:53,106
It'll be different this time.
I promise.

287
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:55,683
I promise difference.
I'm committed to difference.

288
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:58,845
I need someone a little more stable.

289
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:01,820
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock.

290
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:06,019
I take these glasses off, you can't tell
the difference between me and a rock.

291
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:09,529
I put these glasses on a rock, you
know what jumps into people's minds?

292
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,668
Costanza.

293
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:14,565
- People don't change.
- I change. I change.

294
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:16,968
Two weeks ago,
I tried a soft-boiled egg.

295
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:22,043
Never liked it before. Now, I'm dunking
a piece of toast in there and loving it.

296
00:16:22,513 --> 00:16:25,175
I'm not a soft-boiled egg.

297
00:16:25,782 --> 00:16:28,546
And I am not a piece of toast.

298
00:16:28,719 --> 00:16:31,244
I just don't think that we have
anything in common.

299
00:16:31,421 --> 00:16:33,514
That's okay. That's good.

300
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:36,750
You think Louis Pasteur and
his wife had anything in common?

301
00:16:36,927 --> 00:16:40,795
He was in the fields all day
with the cows and the milk...

302
00:16:40,964 --> 00:16:44,764
...examining the milk, delving into milk,
consumed with milk.

303
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:47,130
Pasteurization. Homogenization.

304
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:51,104
And she was in the kitchen, killing
cockroaches with a boot on each hand.

305
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:54,239
Why were there
so many cockroaches?

306
00:16:54,411 --> 00:16:57,505
Because there was a lot of cake
lying around the house...

307
00:16:57,681 --> 00:17:02,141
...just sitting there with all the excess
milk from the all experiments.

308
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:07,380
- And they got along?
- Yes. Yes.

309
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,653
She didn't know
about pasteurization.

310
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:13,785
He didn't know about fumigation.
But they made it work.

311
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:18,260
- You can't go in.
- I want to talk to Calvin.

312
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:19,732
- Let me talk to Calvin.
- Wait.

313
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:21,962
- I just want to talk to Calvin.
- Kramer?

314
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:23,764
- Oh, Tia, hi.
- Who are you?

315
00:17:23,941 --> 00:17:25,431
I'm here to talk about the ocean.

316
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:28,170
Oh, yes, Kramer.

317
00:17:28,345 --> 00:17:32,076
I think I know something about this.
Would you excuse us, Tia?

318
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:34,913
- I don't want any trouble, Calvin.
- Neither do I.

319
00:17:36,587 --> 00:17:38,316
Hello. There you are.

320
00:17:38,488 --> 00:17:40,012
Hello. What are you doing here?

321
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,681
I had to talk to you.
You haven't returned my calls.

322
00:17:43,026 --> 00:17:44,960
Well, I've been busy.

323
00:17:45,128 --> 00:17:48,586
I thought we had a good time. The only
explanation I could come up with is...

324
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:51,495
...you think that you caught me...

325
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:54,034
I'd rather not talk about this.

326
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:56,968
But I was clearly
on the outer edge of the nostril.

327
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,370
- I know what I saw.
- But there was no pick.

328
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:01,374
I did not pick. There was no pick.

329
00:18:01,545 --> 00:18:05,174
- I gotta go.
- No. No pick.

330
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:06,714
Now here's the scoop, Calvin.

331
00:18:06,883 --> 00:18:11,343
I came in here last January
to talk to one of your flunkies.

332
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:12,886
Interesting face.

333
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:17,320
And when I told him my idea
about the beach cologne...

334
00:18:17,494 --> 00:18:18,984
...you know, he laughed at me.

335
00:18:19,162 --> 00:18:22,393
You're very lithe, aren't you?
Very graceful.

336
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:24,791
Well, yeah.

337
00:18:27,638 --> 00:18:29,333
- Sit down.
- All right.

338
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,970
You're very lean. But muscular.

339
00:18:36,146 --> 00:18:40,139
You know, I try to take care of myself.
I watch what I eat.

340
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:43,081
Just recently, I cut out fructose.

341
00:18:43,253 --> 00:18:46,313
I think you're spectacular.

342
00:18:50,827 --> 00:18:54,786
I told you, Fred. My friend's
next-door neighbor took it.

343
00:18:54,965 --> 00:18:56,330
So, what happened?

344
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,027
Well, l... I must have missed a button.
I forgot to button it.

345
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:03,730
I really don't see how you could
miss a button like that.

346
00:19:03,907 --> 00:19:05,397
Oh, you've never missed a button?

347
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:09,536
- Yeah.
- It's your sister, Gail.

348
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:12,546
Oh, God. My nephew.

349
00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:14,578
Hi, Gail.

350
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:15,979
Yeah.

351
00:19:16,153 --> 00:19:18,280
Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.

352
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:20,855
Hey, Nip, you need
that manuscript, or can I take it?

353
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:24,824
Take it. Take it.
And stop calling me Nip.

354
00:19:25,562 --> 00:19:27,928
It was an accident.

355
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,961
Well, it's gotta be somewhere.
Look under his mattress.

356
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:55,649
About the focus group? I have nothing
to do with the focus group.

357
00:19:58,495 --> 00:20:00,360
Oh, yeah.

358
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:06,033
He's sexual...

359
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:08,831
...athletic and without a trace
of self-consciousness.

360
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:11,339
His buttocks are sublime.

361
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:14,910
His pectorals could use some work.
Get him into the weight room.

362
00:20:15,078 --> 00:20:19,105
No. Let's get him in the studio today.
We could send these out immediately.

363
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,016
You've done it again, C.K.

364
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:29,522
And what if I did do it? Even though
I admit to nothing and never will.

365
00:20:29,693 --> 00:20:31,285
What does that make me?

366
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:35,363
I'm not just defending myself, but all
those pickers who have been caught.

367
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:37,831
Each and every one of them...

368
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:43,303
...who has to suffer the shame and
humiliation because of people like you.

369
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:48,274
Are we not human?
If we pick, do we not bleed?

370
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,508
I am not an animal.

371
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:58,177
I did not bare myself deliberately,
but I tell you, I wish now that I had.

372
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:01,813
Because it is not me
that has been exposed, but you.

373
00:21:01,992 --> 00:21:05,621
For I have seen the nipple
on your soul!

374
00:21:08,331 --> 00:21:10,799
So the minute I started up the steps
to her apartment...

375
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:12,559
...I knew I made a terrible mistake.

376
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:16,038
Going back with her.

377
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:18,830
So we're in her apartment.
She goes into the bathroom.

378
00:21:19,009 --> 00:21:22,775
I'm cursing myself.
Now how do I get out of there?

379
00:21:22,946 --> 00:21:25,176
And then it hits me
like a bolt of lightning.

380
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:28,317
The pick.

381
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:31,720
- The pick?
- The pick?

382
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:35,819
She comes out of the bathroom,
I'm in up to my wrist.

383
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:40,863
You should've seen
the look on her face.

384
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:43,499
I think I've seen that look.

385
00:21:44,634 --> 00:21:47,626
Hey, I got the magazine.
The underwear ad came out.

386
00:21:47,804 --> 00:21:49,704
Hey, Calvin Klein!

387
00:21:49,873 --> 00:21:53,809
- Hey, you look great!
- Neat.

388
00:21:53,977 --> 00:21:56,207
Boy, they really
worked on your pectorals.

389
00:21:56,379 --> 00:21:59,109
- Well.
- Your buttocks are spectacular.

390
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:01,443
- Oh, my.
- What?

391
00:22:01,618 --> 00:22:05,520
Well, I'm not sure...

392
00:22:05,755 --> 00:22:09,088
...but I think I see your...

393
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:11,122
The human body
is a lot of maintenance.

394
00:22:11,294 --> 00:22:14,821
A lot of showering, a lot of shaving,
a lot of cleaning, a lot of clipping...

395
00:22:14,998 --> 00:22:18,024
...a lot of checking. If your body
was a car, you wouldn't buy it.

396
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:21,068
It's too much upkeep.
It's a pain.

397
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:23,900
But women definitely go
to the absolute extreme.

398
00:22:24,074 --> 00:22:28,602
To me, it's amazing the way women
take care of all the hair on their bodies.

399
00:22:28,778 --> 00:22:30,803
One of the
great mysteries to me...

400
00:22:30,981 --> 00:22:33,973
...is the fact that a woman
could pour hot wax on her legs...

401
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:39,144
...rip the hair out by the root
and still be afraid of a spider.
