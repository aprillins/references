1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,247
Every time somebody recommends
a doctor, he's always the best.

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,628
''This guy's the best.''
They can't all be the best.

3
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:11,588
There can't be this many bests.

4
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:14,694
Someone's graduating
at the bottom of these classes.

5
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:16,764
Where are these doctors?

6
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:18,886
Is somewhere someone
saying to their friend:

7
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:21,697
''You should see my doctor.
He's the worst.

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,739
Oh, yeah. He's the worst.
He's the absolute worst there is.

9
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:28,197
Whatever you've got,
it'll be worse after you see him.

10
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,108
He's just a-- He's a butcher.
The man's a butcher.''

11
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:36,064
Then there's always that, ''Make sure
you tell him that you know me.''

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,117
Why? What's the difference?
He's a doctor.

13
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:40,765
What is he--?
''Oh, you know Bob.

14
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:44,130
Oh, okay, I'll give you
the real medicine.

15
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:47,170
Everybody else
I'm giving Tic Tacs.''

16
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:57,531
And usually for lunch, I'll have a salad.
And for dinner, I eat whatever I want.

17
00:00:58,277 --> 00:01:01,124
What do you think
the worst part of being blind is?

18
00:01:03,684 --> 00:01:04,862
Excuse me?

19
00:01:05,029 --> 00:01:06,490
You know, if you were blind...

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,278
...what do you think
the worst part of it would be?

21
00:01:10,276 --> 00:01:11,586
I don't know.

22
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:15,676
I think it would be not being able to tell
if there was bugs in my food.

23
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:22,082
How could you ever
enjoy a meal like that?

24
00:01:22,244 --> 00:01:25,724
I'd constantly be feeling around
with my lips and my tongue.

25
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:30,649
Well, that's how my 5-year-old eats.
He's a very picky eater.

26
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:34,365
Hear about that kid that was kidnapped
the other day in Pennsylvania?

27
00:01:34,532 --> 00:01:36,026
No.

28
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:38,716
He was at a carnival with his mother.
She gets a hot dog...

29
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:41,982
...next thing you know,
she turns around, boom, he's gone.

30
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:46,402
Imagine how sick a person has to be
to do something like that.

31
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:48,897
And these people
are all over the place.

32
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,250
You never know who's crazy.
I could be one of these people.

33
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,603
Have you seen any good movies?

34
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:58,527
Who takes care of your boy
during the day?

35
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:00,992
We have a woman. Why?

36
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:03,905
-No, I'm just saying.
-She had references.

37
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:06,651
I'm sure she did.
I'm sure they're impeccable.

38
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:08,863
I'm talking about the ones
that forge them.

39
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:15,607
You know,
I think this is really helping.

40
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:17,435
I don't live near here, you know.

41
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:25,021
So she's giving me the massage
and I'm just making conversation.

42
00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:28,414
-I don't like to talk during a massage.
-Neither do I, but I do it for them.

43
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:30,944
-I figure they're bored.
-Yeah, I do that too.

44
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:34,902
I feel guilty about getting the pleasure.
I feel like I don't deserve it, so I talk.

45
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,796
It stops me from enjoying it.

46
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,422
There's nothing to eat in here.

47
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:41,406
-I forgot to tell you.
-I'm in the middle of a story.

48
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:43,903
-Okay, go ahead.
-Why don't you ever go shopping?

49
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:46,170
It's not like it's a really funny story.

50
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:49,849
-What happened?
-So she mentioned that she had a son.

51
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:51,577
And then for some reason...

52
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:55,421
...I launch into the story about the kid
from Pennsylvania who was abducted.

53
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:57,886
-Oh, wasn't that terrible?
-Yes, it was.

54
00:02:58,048 --> 00:02:59,226
Not even an apple.

55
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:01,399
She doesn't wanna hear that.
That was stupid.

56
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,902
-I know it was stupid.
-Really stupid.

57
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,558
Hey, I just said it was stupid.

58
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:07,767
-What about this Chinese food?
-Take it.

59
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:11,164
-I can't believe you said that.
-Hey, would you stop it already.

60
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:12,981
So, what did she say?

61
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,061
She actually seemed
to get a little paranoid.

62
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,682
This is terrible.
What is this, ginger?

63
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:21,465
I hate ginger. I can't understand
how anyone can eat ginger.

64
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:23,671
-I have a good masseuse.
-No, she's really good.

65
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:26,140
She's not just a masseuse.
She's a physical therapist.

66
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:28,670
There's a big difference.
She uses the ultrasound.

67
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:30,205
It's a real medical procedure.

68
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:33,814
In fact, if you get a doctor's note,
it's covered by insurance.

69
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,078
Physical therapy is covered
by insurance?

70
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:39,448
Yeah.

71
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:43,094
-You don't pay for the massage?
-Not if you have a doctor's note.

72
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:44,887
So where do you get this note?

73
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:47,322
I've never actually done it,
but if I wanted to...

74
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:49,852
...I could probably get one from Roy,
the dentist.

75
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:51,540
Right. Your friend Roy.

76
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,564
What's the name
of this physical therapist?

77
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:57,141
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything
about her kid. She's a little off.

78
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:59,382
And you don't have to pay?

79
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:02,971
We have 3:00 appointments.

80
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,238
-George and Elaine, right?
-Right.

81
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:07,609
Could you fill these out, please?

82
00:04:07,773 --> 00:04:10,522
And, Elaine,
you'll be seeing Julianna.

83
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:13,619
And, George,
you'll be with Raymond.

84
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:20,251
Excuse me. Did you say Raymond?

85
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:21,686
Yes.

86
00:04:24,284 --> 00:04:27,546
But Raymond is a man.

87
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,194
That's right.

88
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:39,986
I can't get a massage from a man.

89
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:42,449
-Why not?
-What, are you crazy?

90
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,921
I can't have a man touching me.

91
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,640
Switch with me.

92
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:48,240
I don't want the man either.

93
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,537
What? You're a woman.
They're supposed to be touching you.

94
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,015
-He'd just be touching your back.
-He'd just be touching your back too.

95
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:58,937
-No, it could get sexual.
-I know.

96
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,360
That's the point. lf it's gonna get
sexual, it should get sexual with you.

97
00:05:02,522 --> 00:05:05,239
-I wouldn't be comfortable.
-I would?

98
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:08,435
-What if something happens?
-Oh, what could happen?

99
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,112
What if it felt good?

100
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,523
-It's supposed to feel good.
-I don't want it to feel good.

101
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:21,424
-Then why get the massage?
-Exactly.

102
00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:27,799
George.

103
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:34,192
-Yes.
-I'm Raymond.

104
00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:37,359
Hello.

105
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:40,657
Are you ready?

106
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:53,810
And then Julianna asked me if
I wanted to join her here in the office.

107
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:55,154
Really?

108
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,459
Used to be a flight attendant.

109
00:06:00,472 --> 00:06:02,097
Oh, boy.

110
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:06,093
Why don't you open those pants.
It's gonna be a lot easier that way.

111
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:22,606
-So, what do you do?
-What?

112
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:24,885
I said, what do you do?

113
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,605
I don't know.

114
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,708
-You don't know what you do?
-No.

115
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,602
Oh, come on.

116
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:35,733
-You're very tense.
-Coffee. Too much coffee.

117
00:06:35,926 --> 00:06:38,511
Take off those pants.
I'll work the hamstring.

118
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:41,045
Oh, the hamstring's fine.

119
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:46,066
-But you wrote that it was tender.
-I wrote. I wrote.

120
00:06:46,902 --> 00:06:48,276
I'll check it out.

121
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:51,315
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. Take them off.

122
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,762
How did you hurt this?

123
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:24,394
I don't know.

124
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:26,803
-You don't know?
-No.

125
00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:28,655
-But you just told me.
-Korea.

126
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:31,472
-You hurt it in Korea?
-What?

127
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:34,003
-The hamstring.
-Korea.

128
00:07:34,676 --> 00:07:36,051
How?

129
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:37,772
Hamstring.

130
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,176
How did you hurt the hamstring?

131
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,966
Hotel.

132
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:50,763
How'd it go?

133
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:54,060
George?

134
00:07:55,635 --> 00:07:59,050
No appointments at all?
Because my neck is still tight.

135
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:00,877
What about Thursday?

136
00:08:01,043 --> 00:08:02,636
And Friday?

137
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:06,663
Oh, boy. Okay. Thanks anyway.

138
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,655
What's with you?

139
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:15,723
A....

140
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,963
Yes. A....

141
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:21,258
A man gave me....

142
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:24,007
Yes. A man gave you....

143
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:27,145
A man gave me...

144
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:30,379
...a massage.

145
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:33,033
-So?
-So he...

146
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:35,983
...had his hands and....

147
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:38,607
He was....

148
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:43,311
-He was what?
-He-- He was...

149
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:45,648
...touching and rubbing.

150
00:08:46,737 --> 00:08:48,111
That's a massage.

151
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:50,957
-Then I took my pants off.
-You took your pants off?

152
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:53,936
For my hamstring.

153
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:56,427
He got about...

154
00:08:56,592 --> 00:08:58,599
...two inches from...

155
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:01,867
-...there.
-Really?

156
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:05,006
I think it moved.

157
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:08,911
-It moved?
-It may have moved. I don't know.

158
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:12,650
-I'm sure it didn't move.
-It moved!

159
00:09:12,816 --> 00:09:15,663
It was imperceptible, but I felt it.

160
00:09:15,824 --> 00:09:18,573
Maybe it just wanted
to change positions. You know...

161
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:20,939
-...shift to the other side.
-No, no.

162
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:24,583
It wasn't a shift. I've shifted.
This was a move.

163
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:29,260
-Okay. So what if it moved?
-That's the sign, the test.

164
00:09:29,423 --> 00:09:31,910
lf a-- lf a man makes it move.

165
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:34,664
That's not the test.
Contact is the test.

166
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,245
lf it moves as a result of contact.

167
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:42,124
Do you think it's contact?
It has to be touched?

168
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:44,588
That's what a gym teacher
once told me.

169
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:49,385
-Hey.
-Hey.

170
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,557
I just saw Joe DiMaggio
in Dinky Doughnuts.

171
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,972
You know, I looked in there and there
he was having coffee and a doughnut.

172
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:57,484
Joe DiMaggio?

173
00:09:57,646 --> 00:09:59,206
-In Dinky Doughnuts?
-Yes.

174
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:01,513
-Joe DiMaggio.
-No. I'm sorry.

175
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:05,289
lf Joe DiMaggio wants a doughnut,
he goes to a fancy restaurant.

176
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:07,460
He's not sitting in Dinky Doughnuts.

177
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:09,636
Well, maybe he likes
Dinky Doughnuts.

178
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:11,780
I don't like to sit next
to men on airplanes...

179
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:13,476
...because our knees might touch.

180
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:16,100
I can't see Joe DiMaggio
sitting at the counter...

181
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:19,171
...at little, tiny, filthy,
smelly Dinky Doughnuts.

182
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,729
Why can't he have a doughnut
like everybody else?

183
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:25,414
He can have a doughnut,
but not a Dinky.

184
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:29,545
I don't even like to use urinals.
Always been a stall man.

185
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,776
Look, I'm telling--

186
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,875
I'm telling you,
that was Joe DiMaggio.

187
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:41,865
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe.
He's in Dinky Doughnuts.

188
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:43,304
What about this doctor's note?

189
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,508
-Let's go see Roy.
-I never said I'd do that.

190
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:47,781
What are you talking about?
That's 75 bucks.

191
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,922
I'm not working. I can't afford that.

192
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:51,618
I don't know how I feel about it.

193
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:54,176
Oh, what are you,
like a Quaker now?

194
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:56,901
All right, all right.

195
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:59,042
A stall man, huh?

196
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:04,803
So we were wondering if it was
possible for you to write us a note.

197
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:06,629
And if you can't,
believe me, it's fine.

198
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:09,445
-He didn't say he can't.
-lf you feel funny about it at all.

199
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:11,138
-He doesn't feel funny.
-lf he does.

200
00:11:11,307 --> 00:11:12,714
-Do you feel funny?
-Forget it.

201
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:16,322
-He didn't say anything.
-He feels funny.

202
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:19,432
-You don't have to do this.
-He knows that!

203
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:21,733
Should we go?
Is this a breach of our friendship?

204
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:23,872
Oh, can you be any more dramatic?

205
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,115
Don't be ridiculous.

206
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:31,045
Holyfield. He's a good friend
of one of my patients.

207
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,966
He's got a hell of a body,
doesn't he?

208
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,624
How would I know?

209
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:37,312
Do you like him?

210
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:39,112
What do you mean, like him?

211
00:11:39,402 --> 00:11:41,736
-Do you like him?
-Well, I mean, he's a good fighter...

212
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:44,231
...and a nice guy,
but I don't like him.

213
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:47,080
-How come you don't like him?
-Why should l?

214
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:49,380
-What is the matter with you?
-Nothing. Why?

215
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:51,847
You think something's wrong?
Am I different?

216
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:54,468
-So you want the notes?
-You don't have to, really.

217
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:56,225
No, no. It's okay.

218
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:59,557
We should probably get one
for Elaine too, right, George?

219
00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:02,019
George?

220
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:06,463
George.

221
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:10,398
What about the week after?

222
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:15,590
No appointments at all?

223
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:18,272
What?

224
00:12:19,464 --> 00:12:20,925
Well, can l--?

225
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:24,805
Can I at least just talk to her
so I can apologize?

226
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,328
Forget it.

227
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:31,325
I can't believe this.
I make one innocent comment...

228
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:34,495
...about some lunatic in Pennsylvania,
and I'm cut off.

229
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:37,052
This woman is insane.

230
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,493
What's with you?

231
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,468
What?

232
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:44,734
You were too close to me.
I was all scrunched in there.

233
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:47,070
Hey, you scrunched me.

234
00:12:47,238 --> 00:12:49,693
I sat down here first.

235
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:52,091
Hey.

236
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:57,061
I saw DiMaggio
in the doughnut shop again.

237
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,459
-Yeah.
-Joe DiMaggio?

238
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:06,589
Joe DiMaggio. This time I went in
and I sat down across from him...

239
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:08,165
...and I really watched him.

240
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:10,497
I studied his every move.

241
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:13,858
For example, he dunks.

242
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:17,252
-Joe DiMaggio dunks his doughnuts?
-That's right.

243
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:20,675
See, now I know it's not him.
Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.

244
00:13:20,837 --> 00:13:22,625
Oh, he's a dunker.

245
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:26,402
-Why couldn't he be a dunker?
-Nothing diverts his attention.

246
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:29,314
Like, I'm sitting in there,
you know...

247
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:34,016
...and I start banging on the table
so that he'll look up.

248
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,741
Like I'm sitting there, and l--

249
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:43,262
He wouldn't move. So then I started
doing these yelping noises, like:

250
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:52,124
No reaction, because the guy
is so focused, you see.

251
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:55,161
He can just block out anything
that's going on around him.

252
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:57,720
See, that's how he played baseball.

253
00:13:57,892 --> 00:14:00,259
He dunks like he hits.

254
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,980
-So then what?
-Well...

255
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:04,930
...then the waitress, she comes up
and she tells me to shut up...

256
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:06,879
...or they're gonna throw me out.

257
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:09,694
Why didn't you just
call out his name?

258
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:16,093
What happened to you?

259
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:20,834
These kids called me a Mary.

260
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,580
A what?

261
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:26,113
I was jumping over a puddle.

262
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:29,471
For some reason, I went like this:

263
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:32,606
And they called me a Mary.

264
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,769
So I chased them
and I tripped and I fell.

265
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:39,287
Yeah, you know kids.
They can be very perceptive.

266
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:42,524
Hey, George. What is this?

267
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:43,900
What is that?

268
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:46,204
No, really. What is that?

269
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:52,310
Hello.

270
00:14:52,481 --> 00:14:54,303
Oh, hi, Roy.

271
00:14:54,465 --> 00:14:55,774
What?

272
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:57,341
Oh, my God.

273
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:00,055
How did this happen?

274
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,271
What can I do?

275
00:15:03,457 --> 00:15:05,878
I am so sorry.

276
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:07,420
Okay.

277
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:08,828
Bye.

278
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:12,309
That was Roy. He's under
investigation for insurance fraud.

279
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:28,056
-I told you.
-Told me what?

280
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:30,744
-I told you we shouldn't do it.
-I didn't say anything.

281
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:34,457
He's got a house, a family.
They could take away his license.

282
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:38,518
Three notes. How stupid was that?
We never should've got three notes.

283
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,859
-Three notes?
-Yeah. You, me and George.

284
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,430
-You got me a note?
-Yeah.

285
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:44,152
-But I got my own note.
-You what?

286
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,635
-I got a note from my gynecologist.
-Why'd you do that?

287
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:50,621
-I didn't know you'd get me a note.
-Of course I'd get you a note.

288
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:52,757
-You didn't say anything.
-Neither did you.

289
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:55,829
That's how he got caught. We
sent in four notes from two doctors.

290
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,333
How could you do that
to your friend?

291
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:04,569
He's got a wife, kids
and a lot of other stuff.

292
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:07,898
Oh, yeah.

293
00:16:12,478 --> 00:16:14,332
-Hi, Pam.
-Hello.

294
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:16,020
Hello.

295
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:19,289
I just thought maybe
I could talk to Roy if--

296
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:22,388
Pam, did the x-ray
from Mrs. Sloane--?

297
00:16:22,558 --> 00:16:23,768
-Hi.
-Hi, Roy.

298
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,842
-How you doing?
-Come on back.

299
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:27,922
I have a patient, but she's under.

300
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:30,905
-I don't even know what to say.
-Me neither.

301
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:33,851
-I knew this would happen.
-Me too.

302
00:16:35,997 --> 00:16:38,102
I mean, the whole thing, it's just....

303
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:40,658
-Tragic.
-Well, it's not tragic.

304
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:42,803
-No?
-No. It's....

305
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:45,339
-Unsettling?
-Okay.

306
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:49,394
-I mean, what if they--?
-I hope you're both happy.

307
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:53,526
I'm not happy.

308
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:57,368
Me, neither.
I've never been happy.

309
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,610
I mean, I'm happy sometimes,
but not now.

310
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:04,852
In college, maybe.

311
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:08,563
-Those were fun times.
-Yeah, college was fun.

312
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:12,624
You know the whole practice
is in jeopardy. You know that.

313
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:17,776
-Don't mind her.
-Oh, please. I love her.

314
00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:20,565
I've just met her,
but I'm very impressed.

315
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:23,480
I've never had a problem
with these notes before.

316
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,136
What's gonna happen now?

317
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:28,690
Nothing, as long as we get the physical
therapist to go along with our story.

318
00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:30,385
What? The physical therapist? Why?

319
00:17:30,555 --> 00:17:33,238
She has to say the complaint
was related to a dental problem.

320
00:17:37,594 --> 00:17:38,771
How you doing?

321
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:44,401
Hi. Look, I know
I don't have an appointment...

322
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,057
...but it's really important
that I talk with Julianna.

323
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:48,720
I'm sorry. She's not in.

324
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,443
I know she's mad at me,
but I really have to speak with her.

325
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,039
I told you she's not here.

326
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:54,736
Look, you have to leave.

327
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:56,335
Wait a second. Don't you--?

328
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:58,644
Hi. Look,
I don't know what you think--

329
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:00,238
-Please.
-But, you see....

330
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:03,060
Let me talk to you for a second.
What I did is inadvertently--

331
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:05,843
I treated you, so please
just get out of the office.

332
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:07,606
Can't you listen to me?

333
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:10,452
Run, Billy! Run to the office
and close the door.

334
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:11,922
Call the police.

335
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,353
The police.

336
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,829
What is the--?

337
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:17,519
Hi, George.

338
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:20,120
Hello.

339
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:22,605
Raymond?

340
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:29,046
Well, I mean,
it's only a six-month probation.

341
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,637
It's a slap on the wrist.

342
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:33,742
I still don't see any dinner invitations
forthcoming.

343
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:36,853
Men have been popping
into my sexual fantasies.

344
00:18:39,127 --> 00:18:41,232
All of a sudden, I'll be in the middle.

345
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:43,539
Of what?

346
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,267
And a guy will appear
from out of nowhere.

347
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:50,675
I said, ''Get out of here.

348
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,847
What do you want?
You don't belong here.''

349
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:55,732
-What do they do?
-They talk back.

350
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:58,000
They go, ''Hey, George,
how's it going?''

351
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,556
I said, ''Get the hell out of here.''

352
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:02,701
Hey, it's the K-Man.

353
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:08,716
Maybe it's time
you got a different hobby.

354
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:11,435
Oh, man.

355
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,824
Just came from Roy's.

356
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:18,165
I threw up from the gas.

357
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,425
-Did he say anything?
-No, no. He's fine.

358
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:29,036
Oh, my God. It's....

359
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:31,539
-What?
-Joe DiMaggio.

360
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:34,228
Having a cup of coffee.

361
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:36,845
-And he's dunking.
-Yeah.

362
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:40,174
Look at him.

363
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:42,763
The Yankee Clipper.

364
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,210
Here.

365
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:47,371
You see?
Now, that is a handsome man.

366
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:54,320
Oh, please.

367
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,589
Wait. Hold on a minute. Wait.

368
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,543
See? I told you.

369
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,049
What causes homophobia?

370
00:20:08,211 --> 00:20:12,619
What is it that makes
a heterosexual man worry?

371
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:17,009
I think it's because men know
that deep down...

372
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:19,276
...we have weak sales resistance.

373
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:22,864
We're constantly buying shoes
that hurt us, pants that don't fit right.

374
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:26,893
Men think, ''Obviously,
I can be talked into anything.

375
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:30,222
What if I accidentally wander
into some sort of homosexual store...

376
00:20:30,386 --> 00:20:32,623
...thinking it's a shoe store,
and the salesman goes:

377
00:20:32,787 --> 00:20:36,747
'Just hold this guy's hand, walk
around the store. See how you feel.

378
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:39,567
No obligation, no pressure,
just try it.

379
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,247
Would you like to see him
in a sandal?'''

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,247
Every time somebody recommends
a doctor, he's always the best.

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,628
''This guy's the best.''
They can't all be the best.

3
00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:11,588
There can't be this many bests.

4
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:14,694
Someone's graduating
at the bottom of these classes.

5
00:00:14,855 --> 00:00:16,764
Where are these doctors?

6
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:18,886
Is somewhere someone
saying to their friend:

7
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:21,697
''You should see my doctor.
He's the worst.

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,739
Oh, yeah. He's the worst.
He's the absolute worst there is.

9
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:28,197
Whatever you've got,
it'll be worse after you see him.

10
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,108
He's just a-- He's a butcher.
The man's a butcher.''

11
00:00:32,006 --> 00:00:36,064
Then there's always that, ''Make sure
you tell him that you know me.''

12
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,117
Why? What's the difference?
He's a doctor.

13
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:40,765
What is he--?
''Oh, you know Bob.

14
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:44,130
Oh, okay, I'll give you
the real medicine.

15
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:47,170
Everybody else
I'm giving Tic Tacs.''

16
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:57,531
And usually for lunch, I'll have a salad.
And for dinner, I eat whatever I want.

17
00:00:58,277 --> 00:01:01,124
What do you think
the worst part of being blind is?

18
00:01:03,684 --> 00:01:04,862
Excuse me?

19
00:01:05,029 --> 00:01:06,490
You know, if you were blind...

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,278
...what do you think
the worst part of it would be?

21
00:01:10,276 --> 00:01:11,586
I don't know.

22
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:15,676
I think it would be not being able to tell
if there was bugs in my food.

23
00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:22,082
How could you ever
enjoy a meal like that?

24
00:01:22,244 --> 00:01:25,724
I'd constantly be feeling around
with my lips and my tongue.

25
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:30,649
Well, that's how my 5-year-old eats.
He's a very picky eater.

26
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:34,365
Hear about that kid that was kidnapped
the other day in Pennsylvania?

27
00:01:34,532 --> 00:01:36,026
No.

28
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:38,716
He was at a carnival with his mother.
She gets a hot dog...

29
00:01:38,883 --> 00:01:41,982
...next thing you know,
she turns around, boom, he's gone.

30
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:46,402
Imagine how sick a person has to be
to do something like that.

31
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:48,897
And these people
are all over the place.

32
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,250
You never know who's crazy.
I could be one of these people.

33
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,603
Have you seen any good movies?

34
00:01:56,771 --> 00:01:58,527
Who takes care of your boy
during the day?

35
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:00,992
We have a woman. Why?

36
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:03,905
-No, I'm just saying.
-She had references.

37
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:06,651
I'm sure she did.
I'm sure they're impeccable.

38
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:08,863
I'm talking about the ones
that forge them.

39
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:15,607
You know,
I think this is really helping.

40
00:02:15,777 --> 00:02:17,435
I don't live near here, you know.

41
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:25,021
So she's giving me the massage
and I'm just making conversation.

42
00:02:25,185 --> 00:02:28,414
-I don't like to talk during a massage.
-Neither do I, but I do it for them.

43
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:30,944
-I figure they're bored.
-Yeah, I do that too.

44
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:34,902
I feel guilty about getting the pleasure.
I feel like I don't deserve it, so I talk.

45
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:36,796
It stops me from enjoying it.

46
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,422
There's nothing to eat in here.

47
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:41,406
-I forgot to tell you.
-I'm in the middle of a story.

48
00:02:41,568 --> 00:02:43,903
-Okay, go ahead.
-Why don't you ever go shopping?

49
00:02:44,065 --> 00:02:46,170
It's not like it's a really funny story.

50
00:02:46,337 --> 00:02:49,849
-What happened?
-So she mentioned that she had a son.

51
00:02:50,016 --> 00:02:51,577
And then for some reason...

52
00:02:51,744 --> 00:02:55,421
...I launch into the story about the kid
from Pennsylvania who was abducted.

53
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:57,886
-Oh, wasn't that terrible?
-Yes, it was.

54
00:02:58,048 --> 00:02:59,226
Not even an apple.

55
00:02:59,391 --> 00:03:01,399
She doesn't wanna hear that.
That was stupid.

56
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:03,902
-I know it was stupid.
-Really stupid.

57
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,558
Hey, I just said it was stupid.

58
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:07,767
-What about this Chinese food?
-Take it.

59
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:11,164
-I can't believe you said that.
-Hey, would you stop it already.

60
00:03:11,552 --> 00:03:12,981
So, what did she say?

61
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,061
She actually seemed
to get a little paranoid.

62
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:18,682
This is terrible.
What is this, ginger?

63
00:03:18,847 --> 00:03:21,465
I hate ginger. I can't understand
how anyone can eat ginger.

64
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:23,671
-I have a good masseuse.
-No, she's really good.

65
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:26,140
She's not just a masseuse.
She's a physical therapist.

66
00:03:26,303 --> 00:03:28,670
There's a big difference.
She uses the ultrasound.

67
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:30,205
It's a real medical procedure.

68
00:03:30,366 --> 00:03:33,814
In fact, if you get a doctor's note,
it's covered by insurance.

69
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:38,078
Physical therapy is covered
by insurance?

70
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:39,448
Yeah.

71
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:43,094
-You don't pay for the massage?
-Not if you have a doctor's note.

72
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:44,887
So where do you get this note?

73
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:47,322
I've never actually done it,
but if I wanted to...

74
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:49,852
...I could probably get one from Roy,
the dentist.

75
00:03:50,013 --> 00:03:51,540
Right. Your friend Roy.

76
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,564
What's the name
of this physical therapist?

77
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:57,141
I'll tell you, but don't ask her anything
about her kid. She's a little off.

78
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:59,382
And you don't have to pay?

79
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:02,971
We have 3:00 appointments.

80
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,238
-George and Elaine, right?
-Right.

81
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:07,609
Could you fill these out, please?

82
00:04:07,773 --> 00:04:10,522
And, Elaine,
you'll be seeing Julianna.

83
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:13,619
And, George,
you'll be with Raymond.

84
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:20,251
Excuse me. Did you say Raymond?

85
00:04:20,476 --> 00:04:21,686
Yes.

86
00:04:24,284 --> 00:04:27,546
But Raymond is a man.

87
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,194
That's right.

88
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:39,986
I can't get a massage from a man.

89
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:42,449
-Why not?
-What, are you crazy?

90
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,921
I can't have a man touching me.

91
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,640
Switch with me.

92
00:04:46,811 --> 00:04:48,240
I don't want the man either.

93
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,537
What? You're a woman.
They're supposed to be touching you.

94
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:56,015
-He'd just be touching your back.
-He'd just be touching your back too.

95
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:58,937
-No, it could get sexual.
-I know.

96
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:02,360
That's the point. lf it's gonna get
sexual, it should get sexual with you.

97
00:05:02,522 --> 00:05:05,239
-I wouldn't be comfortable.
-I would?

98
00:05:05,402 --> 00:05:08,435
-What if something happens?
-Oh, what could happen?

99
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,112
What if it felt good?

100
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,523
-It's supposed to feel good.
-I don't want it to feel good.

101
00:05:18,042 --> 00:05:21,424
-Then why get the massage?
-Exactly.

102
00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:27,799
George.

103
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:34,192
-Yes.
-I'm Raymond.

104
00:05:35,865 --> 00:05:37,359
Hello.

105
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:40,657
Are you ready?

106
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:53,810
And then Julianna asked me if
I wanted to join her here in the office.

107
00:05:53,976 --> 00:05:55,154
Really?

108
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,459
Used to be a flight attendant.

109
00:06:00,472 --> 00:06:02,097
Oh, boy.

110
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:06,093
Why don't you open those pants.
It's gonna be a lot easier that way.

111
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:22,606
-So, what do you do?
-What?

112
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:24,885
I said, what do you do?

113
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,605
I don't know.

114
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,708
-You don't know what you do?
-No.

115
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:31,602
Oh, come on.

116
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:35,733
-You're very tense.
-Coffee. Too much coffee.

117
00:06:35,926 --> 00:06:38,511
Take off those pants.
I'll work the hamstring.

118
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:41,045
Oh, the hamstring's fine.

119
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:46,066
-But you wrote that it was tender.
-I wrote. I wrote.

120
00:06:46,902 --> 00:06:48,276
I'll check it out.

121
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:51,315
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. Take them off.

122
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,762
How did you hurt this?

123
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:24,394
I don't know.

124
00:07:24,948 --> 00:07:26,803
-You don't know?
-No.

125
00:07:26,964 --> 00:07:28,655
-But you just told me.
-Korea.

126
00:07:29,236 --> 00:07:31,472
-You hurt it in Korea?
-What?

127
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:34,003
-The hamstring.
-Korea.

128
00:07:34,676 --> 00:07:36,051
How?

129
00:07:36,212 --> 00:07:37,772
Hamstring.

130
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,176
How did you hurt the hamstring?

131
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,966
Hotel.

132
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:50,763
How'd it go?

133
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:54,060
George?

134
00:07:55,635 --> 00:07:59,050
No appointments at all?
Because my neck is still tight.

135
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:00,877
What about Thursday?

136
00:08:01,043 --> 00:08:02,636
And Friday?

137
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:06,663
Oh, boy. Okay. Thanks anyway.

138
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,655
What's with you?

139
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:15,723
A....

140
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,963
Yes. A....

141
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:21,258
A man gave me....

142
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:24,007
Yes. A man gave you....

143
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:27,145
A man gave me...

144
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:30,379
...a massage.

145
00:08:30,546 --> 00:08:33,033
-So?
-So he...

146
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:35,983
...had his hands and....

147
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:38,607
He was....

148
00:08:39,569 --> 00:08:43,311
-He was what?
-He-- He was...

149
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:45,648
...touching and rubbing.

150
00:08:46,737 --> 00:08:48,111
That's a massage.

151
00:08:48,721 --> 00:08:50,957
-Then I took my pants off.
-You took your pants off?

152
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:53,936
For my hamstring.

153
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:56,427
He got about...

154
00:08:56,592 --> 00:08:58,599
...two inches from...

155
00:09:00,176 --> 00:09:01,867
-...there.
-Really?

156
00:09:03,184 --> 00:09:05,006
I think it moved.

157
00:09:07,056 --> 00:09:08,911
-It moved?
-It may have moved. I don't know.

158
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:12,650
-I'm sure it didn't move.
-It moved!

159
00:09:12,816 --> 00:09:15,663
It was imperceptible, but I felt it.

160
00:09:15,824 --> 00:09:18,573
Maybe it just wanted
to change positions. You know...

161
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:20,939
-...shift to the other side.
-No, no.

162
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:24,583
It wasn't a shift. I've shifted.
This was a move.

163
00:09:25,551 --> 00:09:29,260
-Okay. So what if it moved?
-That's the sign, the test.

164
00:09:29,423 --> 00:09:31,910
lf a-- lf a man makes it move.

165
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:34,664
That's not the test.
Contact is the test.

166
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,245
lf it moves as a result of contact.

167
00:09:38,895 --> 00:09:42,124
Do you think it's contact?
It has to be touched?

168
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:44,588
That's what a gym teacher
once told me.

169
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:49,385
-Hey.
-Hey.

170
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,557
I just saw Joe DiMaggio
in Dinky Doughnuts.

171
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,972
You know, I looked in there and there
he was having coffee and a doughnut.

172
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:57,484
Joe DiMaggio?

173
00:09:57,646 --> 00:09:59,206
-In Dinky Doughnuts?
-Yes.

174
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:01,513
-Joe DiMaggio.
-No. I'm sorry.

175
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:05,289
lf Joe DiMaggio wants a doughnut,
he goes to a fancy restaurant.

176
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:07,460
He's not sitting in Dinky Doughnuts.

177
00:10:07,629 --> 00:10:09,636
Well, maybe he likes
Dinky Doughnuts.

178
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:11,780
I don't like to sit next
to men on airplanes...

179
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:13,476
...because our knees might touch.

180
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:16,100
I can't see Joe DiMaggio
sitting at the counter...

181
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:19,171
...at little, tiny, filthy,
smelly Dinky Doughnuts.

182
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,729
Why can't he have a doughnut
like everybody else?

183
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:25,414
He can have a doughnut,
but not a Dinky.

184
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:29,545
I don't even like to use urinals.
Always been a stall man.

185
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,776
Look, I'm telling--

186
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,875
I'm telling you,
that was Joe DiMaggio.

187
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:41,865
The guy slept with Marilyn Monroe.
He's in Dinky Doughnuts.

188
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:43,304
What about this doctor's note?

189
00:10:43,468 --> 00:10:45,508
-Let's go see Roy.
-I never said I'd do that.

190
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:47,781
What are you talking about?
That's 75 bucks.

191
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,922
I'm not working. I can't afford that.

192
00:10:50,092 --> 00:10:51,618
I don't know how I feel about it.

193
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:54,176
Oh, what are you,
like a Quaker now?

194
00:10:55,308 --> 00:10:56,901
All right, all right.

195
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:59,042
A stall man, huh?

196
00:11:01,803 --> 00:11:04,803
So we were wondering if it was
possible for you to write us a note.

197
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:06,629
And if you can't,
believe me, it's fine.

198
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:09,445
-He didn't say he can't.
-lf you feel funny about it at all.

199
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:11,138
-He doesn't feel funny.
-lf he does.

200
00:11:11,307 --> 00:11:12,714
-Do you feel funny?
-Forget it.

201
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:16,322
-He didn't say anything.
-He feels funny.

202
00:11:16,683 --> 00:11:19,432
-You don't have to do this.
-He knows that!

203
00:11:19,594 --> 00:11:21,733
Should we go?
Is this a breach of our friendship?

204
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:23,872
Oh, can you be any more dramatic?

205
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,115
Don't be ridiculous.

206
00:11:28,394 --> 00:11:31,045
Holyfield. He's a good friend
of one of my patients.

207
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,966
He's got a hell of a body,
doesn't he?

208
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,624
How would I know?

209
00:11:35,818 --> 00:11:37,312
Do you like him?

210
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:39,112
What do you mean, like him?

211
00:11:39,402 --> 00:11:41,736
-Do you like him?
-Well, I mean, he's a good fighter...

212
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:44,231
...and a nice guy,
but I don't like him.

213
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:47,080
-How come you don't like him?
-Why should l?

214
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:49,380
-What is the matter with you?
-Nothing. Why?

215
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:51,847
You think something's wrong?
Am I different?

216
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:54,468
-So you want the notes?
-You don't have to, really.

217
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:56,225
No, no. It's okay.

218
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:59,557
We should probably get one
for Elaine too, right, George?

219
00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:02,019
George?

220
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:06,463
George.

221
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:10,398
What about the week after?

222
00:12:13,256 --> 00:12:15,590
No appointments at all?

223
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:18,272
What?

224
00:12:19,464 --> 00:12:20,925
Well, can l--?

225
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:24,805
Can I at least just talk to her
so I can apologize?

226
00:12:25,767 --> 00:12:27,328
Forget it.

227
00:12:27,495 --> 00:12:31,325
I can't believe this.
I make one innocent comment...

228
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:34,495
...about some lunatic in Pennsylvania,
and I'm cut off.

229
00:12:34,663 --> 00:12:37,052
This woman is insane.

230
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,493
What's with you?

231
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,468
What?

232
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:44,734
You were too close to me.
I was all scrunched in there.

233
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:47,070
Hey, you scrunched me.

234
00:12:47,238 --> 00:12:49,693
I sat down here first.

235
00:12:50,662 --> 00:12:52,091
Hey.

236
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:57,061
I saw DiMaggio
in the doughnut shop again.

237
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,459
-Yeah.
-Joe DiMaggio?

238
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:06,589
Joe DiMaggio. This time I went in
and I sat down across from him...

239
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:08,165
...and I really watched him.

240
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:10,497
I studied his every move.

241
00:13:10,662 --> 00:13:13,858
For example, he dunks.

242
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:17,252
-Joe DiMaggio dunks his doughnuts?
-That's right.

243
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:20,675
See, now I know it's not him.
Joe DiMaggio could not be a dunker.

244
00:13:20,837 --> 00:13:22,625
Oh, he's a dunker.

245
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:26,402
-Why couldn't he be a dunker?
-Nothing diverts his attention.

246
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:29,314
Like, I'm sitting in there,
you know...

247
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:34,016
...and I start banging on the table
so that he'll look up.

248
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,741
Like I'm sitting there, and l--

249
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:43,262
He wouldn't move. So then I started
doing these yelping noises, like:

250
00:13:48,164 --> 00:13:52,124
No reaction, because the guy
is so focused, you see.

251
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:55,161
He can just block out anything
that's going on around him.

252
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:57,720
See, that's how he played baseball.

253
00:13:57,892 --> 00:14:00,259
He dunks like he hits.

254
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,980
-So then what?
-Well...

255
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:04,930
...then the waitress, she comes up
and she tells me to shut up...

256
00:14:05,091 --> 00:14:06,879
...or they're gonna throw me out.

257
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:09,694
Why didn't you just
call out his name?

258
00:14:14,434 --> 00:14:16,093
What happened to you?

259
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:20,834
These kids called me a Mary.

260
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,580
A what?

261
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:26,113
I was jumping over a puddle.

262
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:29,471
For some reason, I went like this:

263
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:32,606
And they called me a Mary.

264
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:35,769
So I chased them
and I tripped and I fell.

265
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:39,287
Yeah, you know kids.
They can be very perceptive.

266
00:14:39,938 --> 00:14:42,524
Hey, George. What is this?

267
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:43,900
What is that?

268
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:46,204
No, really. What is that?

269
00:14:50,881 --> 00:14:52,310
Hello.

270
00:14:52,481 --> 00:14:54,303
Oh, hi, Roy.

271
00:14:54,465 --> 00:14:55,774
What?

272
00:14:56,097 --> 00:14:57,341
Oh, my God.

273
00:14:58,113 --> 00:15:00,055
How did this happen?

274
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:02,271
What can I do?

275
00:15:03,457 --> 00:15:05,878
I am so sorry.

276
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:07,420
Okay.

277
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:08,828
Bye.

278
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:12,309
That was Roy. He's under
investigation for insurance fraud.

279
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:28,056
-I told you.
-Told me what?

280
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:30,744
-I told you we shouldn't do it.
-I didn't say anything.

281
00:15:30,912 --> 00:15:34,457
He's got a house, a family.
They could take away his license.

282
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:38,518
Three notes. How stupid was that?
We never should've got three notes.

283
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,859
-Three notes?
-Yeah. You, me and George.

284
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:42,430
-You got me a note?
-Yeah.

285
00:15:42,592 --> 00:15:44,152
-But I got my own note.
-You what?

286
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:47,635
-I got a note from my gynecologist.
-Why'd you do that?

287
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:50,621
-I didn't know you'd get me a note.
-Of course I'd get you a note.

288
00:15:50,782 --> 00:15:52,757
-You didn't say anything.
-Neither did you.

289
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:55,829
That's how he got caught. We
sent in four notes from two doctors.

290
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,333
How could you do that
to your friend?

291
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:04,569
He's got a wife, kids
and a lot of other stuff.

292
00:16:04,734 --> 00:16:07,898
Oh, yeah.

293
00:16:12,478 --> 00:16:14,332
-Hi, Pam.
-Hello.

294
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:16,020
Hello.

295
00:16:16,605 --> 00:16:19,289
I just thought maybe
I could talk to Roy if--

296
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:22,388
Pam, did the x-ray
from Mrs. Sloane--?

297
00:16:22,558 --> 00:16:23,768
-Hi.
-Hi, Roy.

298
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,842
-How you doing?
-Come on back.

299
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:27,922
I have a patient, but she's under.

300
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:30,905
-I don't even know what to say.
-Me neither.

301
00:16:31,069 --> 00:16:33,851
-I knew this would happen.
-Me too.

302
00:16:35,997 --> 00:16:38,102
I mean, the whole thing, it's just....

303
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:40,658
-Tragic.
-Well, it's not tragic.

304
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:42,803
-No?
-No. It's....

305
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:45,339
-Unsettling?
-Okay.

306
00:16:45,533 --> 00:16:49,394
-I mean, what if they--?
-I hope you're both happy.

307
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:53,526
I'm not happy.

308
00:16:54,204 --> 00:16:57,368
Me, neither.
I've never been happy.

309
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,610
I mean, I'm happy sometimes,
but not now.

310
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:04,852
In college, maybe.

311
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:08,563
-Those were fun times.
-Yeah, college was fun.

312
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:12,624
You know the whole practice
is in jeopardy. You know that.

313
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:17,776
-Don't mind her.
-Oh, please. I love her.

314
00:17:17,947 --> 00:17:20,565
I've just met her,
but I'm very impressed.

315
00:17:20,731 --> 00:17:23,480
I've never had a problem
with these notes before.

316
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,136
What's gonna happen now?

317
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:28,690
Nothing, as long as we get the physical
therapist to go along with our story.

318
00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:30,385
What? The physical therapist? Why?

319
00:17:30,555 --> 00:17:33,238
She has to say the complaint
was related to a dental problem.

320
00:17:37,594 --> 00:17:38,771
How you doing?

321
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:44,401
Hi. Look, I know
I don't have an appointment...

322
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,057
...but it's really important
that I talk with Julianna.

323
00:17:47,226 --> 00:17:48,720
I'm sorry. She's not in.

324
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:51,443
I know she's mad at me,
but I really have to speak with her.

325
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,039
I told you she's not here.

326
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:54,736
Look, you have to leave.

327
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:56,335
Wait a second. Don't you--?

328
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:58,644
Hi. Look,
I don't know what you think--

329
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:00,238
-Please.
-But, you see....

330
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:03,060
Let me talk to you for a second.
What I did is inadvertently--

331
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:05,843
I treated you, so please
just get out of the office.

332
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:07,606
Can't you listen to me?

333
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:10,452
Run, Billy! Run to the office
and close the door.

334
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:11,922
Call the police.

335
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,353
The police.

336
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,829
What is the--?

337
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:17,519
Hi, George.

338
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:20,120
Hello.

339
00:18:21,177 --> 00:18:22,605
Raymond?

340
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:29,046
Well, I mean,
it's only a six-month probation.

341
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,637
It's a slap on the wrist.

342
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:33,742
I still don't see any dinner invitations
forthcoming.

343
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:36,853
Men have been popping
into my sexual fantasies.

344
00:18:39,127 --> 00:18:41,232
All of a sudden, I'll be in the middle.

345
00:18:42,263 --> 00:18:43,539
Of what?

346
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,267
And a guy will appear
from out of nowhere.

347
00:18:49,432 --> 00:18:50,675
I said, ''Get out of here.

348
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,847
What do you want?
You don't belong here.''

349
00:18:53,015 --> 00:18:55,732
-What do they do?
-They talk back.

350
00:18:55,895 --> 00:18:58,000
They go, ''Hey, George,
how's it going?''

351
00:18:58,167 --> 00:19:00,556
I said, ''Get the hell out of here.''

352
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:02,701
Hey, it's the K-Man.

353
00:19:06,774 --> 00:19:08,716
Maybe it's time
you got a different hobby.

354
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:11,435
Oh, man.

355
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:15,824
Just came from Roy's.

356
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:18,165
I threw up from the gas.

357
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,425
-Did he say anything?
-No, no. He's fine.

358
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:29,036
Oh, my God. It's....

359
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:31,539
-What?
-Joe DiMaggio.

360
00:19:31,862 --> 00:19:34,228
Having a cup of coffee.

361
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:36,845
-And he's dunking.
-Yeah.

362
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:40,174
Look at him.

363
00:19:40,341 --> 00:19:42,763
The Yankee Clipper.

364
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,210
Here.

365
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:47,371
You see?
Now, that is a handsome man.

366
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:54,320
Oh, please.

367
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,589
Wait. Hold on a minute. Wait.

368
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,543
See? I told you.

369
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,049
What causes homophobia?

370
00:20:08,211 --> 00:20:12,619
What is it that makes
a heterosexual man worry?

371
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:17,009
I think it's because men know
that deep down...

372
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:19,276
...we have weak sales resistance.

373
00:20:19,668 --> 00:20:22,864
We're constantly buying shoes
that hurt us, pants that don't fit right.

374
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:26,893
Men think, ''Obviously,
I can be talked into anything.

375
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:30,222
What if I accidentally wander
into some sort of homosexual store...

376
00:20:30,386 --> 00:20:32,623
...thinking it's a shoe store,
and the salesman goes:

377
00:20:32,787 --> 00:20:36,747
'Just hold this guy's hand, walk
around the store. See how you feel.

378
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:39,567
No obligation, no pressure,
just try it.

379
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,247
Would you like to see him
in a sandal?'''
