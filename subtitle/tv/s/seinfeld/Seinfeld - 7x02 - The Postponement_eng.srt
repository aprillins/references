1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,115
- Hey.
- Hey.

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,670
Big news. The dog problem
has been solved.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,829
Really? What happened?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,911
Well, there's this rabbi
in my building...

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,957
You've met him.
He's a very nice man.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,998
- Is he the one with the show on cable?
- Yeah, yeah, that's the one.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,391
So I spoke to him about the dog,
he went down, talked to the owner...

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,028
...and she agreed to keep the dog
inside from now on.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,634
- That's great.
- I know.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,952
- That looks pretty good.
- He's in.

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,000
Hey, so, you know, we haven't
discussed George's engagement.

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,197
- What's to discuss?
- Come on. George is getting married.

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,554
Is he happy?

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,869
I will never understand
the bathrooms in this country.

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,669
Why is it that the stall doors do not
come all the way down to the floor?

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,559
Maybe it's so you can see
if there's someone in there.

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,592
Isn't that why we have locks
on the doors?

18
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,513
Well, as a backup system,
in case the lock is broken...

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,432
...you can see if it's taken.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,670
A backup system?

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,549
We're designing bathroom doors
with our legs exposed...

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,632
...in anticipation
of the locks not working?

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,876
That's not a system. That's
a complete breakdown of the system.

24
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,917
Can we change the subject, please?

25
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,310
Why, what's wrong with it?
This is a bad subject?

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,552
No, fine. If you wanna keep
talking about it, we'll talk about it.

27
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,951
It's not that I wanna keep
talking about it.

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,317
I just think the subject should resolve
itself based on its own momentum.

29
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,233
Well, I didn't think
that it had any momentum.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,592
How am I gonna do this?

31
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,116
I'm engaged to this woman?
She doesn't even lik e me.

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,238
Change the subject?
Toilets were the subject.

33
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,994
We don't even share
the same interests.

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,193
- Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
- Well, that's all that counts, I guess.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,399
What's the matter?

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,551
What? Nothing.

37
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,954
You don't seem too enthused
about the whole thing.

38
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,792
Well, what do you want me to do?

39
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,428
I thought you'd have
some reaction to it.

40
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,592
Well, I don't.

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,032
I think maybe you're a little jealous.

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,998
Oh, what, you think
I wanna marry George?

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,311
No, but maybe you wish it was you
who was getting married, not him.

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,472
Oh, please.
That is the last thing that I want.

45
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,631
Oh, yeah. Right.

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,233
Yeah, right.

47
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,676
- Laney.
- Jerry.

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,956
- You don't wanna get married?
- Yeah, that's right.

49
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,872
- I don't wanna get married.
- Oh, come on.

50
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,632
- Oh, you come on.
- It's such...

51
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,789
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,236
Hey, Elaine, listen, I was talking
to a friend about this dog business.

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,075
Do you realize this is going to be
on our permanent records?

54
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,593
Are you aware of this?

55
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,150
- Oh, dear.
- It can never be erased.

56
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,357
It'll follow us wherever we go
for the rest of our lives.

57
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,479
I'll never be able to get a job.
I mean, doesn't that concern you?

58
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,519
Everything I've worked for,
down the drain...

59
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,318
...because of one stupid mistake.

60
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,278
I mean, aren't we entitled
to make one mistake in our lives?

61
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,158
- We gotta change the system.
- Yes!

62
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,276
I could care less.

63
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,717
I hope it is on our record.
I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.

64
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,590
- Oh, hello, Rabbi Kursham.
- Elaine.

65
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,512
Always a pleasure to see you.

66
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,594
Thanks again for taking care
of that dog for us.

67
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,594
Elaine, oftentimes in life
there are problems...

68
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,638
...and just as often
there are solutions.

69
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,833
Yeah, yeah, I suppose.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,199
Elaine, you don't seem yourself today.
You seem, if I may say, troubled.

71
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,991
No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.

72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,870
Come upstairs. We'll have a talk.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,228
Hey.

74
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,197
I want your honest opinion
about something.

75
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,238
- Have I ever been less than forthright?
- No, you haven't.

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,755
Well, maybe you have.
What do I know?

77
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,593
I probably have. Of course I have.
What am I talking about?

78
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,877
Okay, tell me what you think
about this idea:

79
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,828
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls
at Yankee Stadium...

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,149
...all the way to the floor.

81
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,873
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls
at Yankee Stadium to the floor?

82
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,235
Door comes down,
hides your feet.

83
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,949
- Yes, I like it. I like it a lot.
- It's good, right?

84
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,873
I think it's fantastic.
I think it's a fantastic idea.

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,314
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

86
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,756
Well, I told it to Susan before
and she didn't like it.

87
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,635
Yeah. Not only that,
this is what she said to me:

88
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,119
"Can we change the subject?"

89
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,111
- See, now, that I don't care for.
- Right.

90
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,794
I mean, we're on a subject.
Why does it have to be changed?

91
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,871
It should resolve of its own volition.

92
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,554
That's exactly what I said,
but I used the word "momentum."

93
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,439
- "Momentum," same thing.
- Same thing.

94
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,748
My God, I'm getting married
in December. Do you know that?

95
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,679
Yeah, I know.

96
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,274
How am I gonna make December?
I need a little more time.

97
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,839
Look at me,
I'm a nervous wreck.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,309
My stomach aches.
My neck is killing me. I can't turn.

99
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,550
Look, look.

100
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,757
- You're turning.
- No, that's not a good turn.

101
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,990
December! December!

102
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,357
Don't you think we should have a little
more time to get to know each other?

103
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,076
If you need more time,
you should have more time.

104
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,278
- What, you think I could postpone it?
- Sure you can. Why not?

105
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,318
- You're allowed to postpone?
- I don't see why not.

106
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,350
- So I could do that?
- Sure, go ahead.

107
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,550
All right. All right.

108
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,870
I'll tell you what, how about this?
I got the date.

109
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,315
March 21 st, the first day of spring.

110
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,948
- Spring, of course.
- You know, spring.

111
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,998
Rejuvenation, rebirth,
everything's blooming.

112
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,957
All that crap.

113
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,633
Beautiful.

114
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,957
- She's not gonna like it.
- No, she's not.

115
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,680
You know, I think
I'm a little bit scared of her.

116
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,350
She's 5'3", like 100 pounds,
I'm frightened to death of her.

117
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,509
Well, she's a women.
They don't like to be disappointed.

118
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,398
Especially her.

119
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,028
She does not like disappointment.

120
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,549
Well, I have to do it.

121
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,790
I can't make December.
No way I can make December.

122
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,871
You can see that, right?
I mean, look at me.

123
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,715
Can I make December? I can't
make December, right? Look! Look!

124
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,474
- Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
- March 21 st.

125
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,756
Hey. So you're gonna
back me on this, right?

126
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,718
- Oh, all the way.
- You are a good friend.

127
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,758
You know what, even if you killed
somebody, I wouldn't turn you in.

128
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,751
Is that so?

129
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,196
Hey, Kramer, if I killed somebody,
would you turn me in?

130
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,717
Definitely.

131
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,028
- You're kidding.
- No, no, I would turn you in.

132
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,148
- You would turn me in?
- I wouldn't even think about it.

133
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,836
You're supposed to be
a friend of mine.

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,833
Well, what kind of person are you,
going around killing people?

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,831
Well, I'm sure I had a good reason.

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,878
Well, if you killed this person,
who's to say I wouldn't be next?

137
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,077
- But you know me.
- I thought I did.

138
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,514
I really appreciate your taking time
to talk with me, Rabbi.

139
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,275
You know, I'm not of your faith.
In fact, I'm not a very religious person.

140
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,911
But I do feel as if I'm in need
of some guidance here.

141
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,072
Would you care for a snack
of some kind?

142
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,637
I have the SnackWells,
which are very popular...

143
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,554
...although I think sometimes
with the so-called fat-free cookies...

144
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,714
...people may overindulge, forgetting
that they may be high in calories.

145
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,589
No. No, thank you.
I'm not very hungry.

146
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,751
Anyway...

147
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,310
...this friend of mine, George,
got engaged.

148
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,311
- How wonderful.
- Yeah, yeah.

149
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,758
Well, for some reason...

150
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,878
...well, I find myself
just overcome...

151
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,998
...with feelings of jealousy
and resentment.

152
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,550
Doesn't it give you any joy
to see your friend...

153
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,598
...enter into this holiest of unions?

154
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,955
No, no. No, it doesn't.

155
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,274
No joy. No joy whatsoever. It just...
The whole thing makes me...

156
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,078
...sick.

157
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,879
You know, Elaine...

158
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,635
...very often we cannot see
the forest for the trees.

159
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,756
Yeah, I don't know
what that means.

160
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,439
Well, for example,
say there's a forest...

161
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,752
Yeah, see, the thing is, Rabbi,
it should've been me.

162
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,754
You know? I'm smart.
I'm attractive.

163
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,435
You know, my temple
has many single functions.

164
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,999
Oh, no, that's okay.

165
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,870
My nephew Alex is someone who's
also looking. Perhaps I could...?

166
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,599
No, I don't think so.

167
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,311
He owns a flower store.
Very successful.

168
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,072
So you're nothing but a stoolie.
Admit it.

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,118
Hey, don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

170
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,834
- Another caffe latte?
- Yeah, you better believe it.

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,436
- Since when are you so trendy?
- Hey, baby, I set the trends.

172
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,636
Who do you think
started this caffe latte thing?

173
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,756
I don't recall you
drinking caffe lattes.

174
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,275
I've been drinking caffe lattes
since the fifth grade...

175
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,589
...and haven't looked back.

176
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,115
Look, Plan 9 from Outer Space
is playing tomorrow night.

177
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,191
- One show only.
- I've always wanted to see it.

178
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,157
I was supposed to see this
five years ago.

179
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,550
I was in a Chinese restaurant
with George and Elaine.

180
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,153
We got screwed up
and missed it.

181
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,833
- Well, let's do it, huh?
- All right.

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,197
Look at this, Jerry.
Dropping paper on the ground.

183
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,952
See, that's littering.

184
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,350
Maybe you ought to call the cops
and turn me in.

185
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,592
Maybe I will.

186
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,271
- Hi.
- Hey, how was your day?

187
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,032
Good. Good day.

188
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,919
- How was...? How was your day?
- Oh, it was okay.

189
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,080
- So, what's going on?
- Oh, nothing much.

190
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:04,550
You know, went over to Jerry's,
talked to Jerry.

191
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,917
Oh, the Lauers wanna get together
with us on Friday night.

192
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,559
The Lauers? Really?

193
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,632
- Do you not wanna go?
- No, no. I wanna go.

194
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,155
So, what did Jerry have to say?

195
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,949
Oh, nothing much.
You know, we were talking.

196
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,832
I had an unbelievable idea
today.

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,070
Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.

198
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,674
Yeah. No, it's not the toilets.
It's something else.

199
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,114
- You ready for this?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,508
- Okay, how about this?
- What?

201
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,749
- All right.
- Okay.

202
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,196
We get married...

203
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,828
...March 21 st,
the first day of spring.

204
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,549
What do you mean?
You wanna postpone the wedding?

205
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,870
No, no, this has got nothing
to do with postponing.

206
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,077
I just think the first day of spring
is the perfect day to get married.

207
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,915
Spring! Rejuvenation, rebirth,
everything is blooming. All that...

208
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,520
If you don't wanna marry me, George,
just say so. Just say so!

209
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,079
No, no, still marry. Still marry.

210
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,358
- No, you don't love me.
- No, no, still love. Still love.

211
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,876
My friends told me
that you were too neurotic...

212
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,316
...and that I was making a mistake.
- No, no, no. No mistake. No mistake.

213
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,436
Listen, we're gonna get married
over Christmas.

214
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,558
Really, it doesn't make
any difference to me. It's fine, really.

215
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,109
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Christmas.

216
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,512
Snow, Santa, all that stuff.

217
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,075
Let me take a guess.

218
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,434
She cried and you caved.

219
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,190
- How did you know that?
- I live and breathe, my friend.

220
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,432
I live and breathe.

221
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,717
I felt terrible. I thought she was
gonna collapse and kill herself.

222
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,077
Yes, it's very difficult.
Few men have the constitution for it.

223
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,071
That's why breakups
take two or three tries.

224
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,673
You gotta build up your immunity.

225
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,070
You see those tears,
you don't know what to do.

226
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,038
It's like she was on fire.
I was just trying to put her out.

227
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,833
Well, at least you probably had some
pretty good make-up sex afterwards.

228
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,875
I didn't have any sex.

229
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,550
You didn't have make-up sex?
How could you not have make-up sex?

230
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,075
That's the best feature
of the heavy relationship.

231
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,558
I missed out on the make-up sex.

232
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,909
In your situation...

233
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,640
...the only sex you're gonna have
better than make-up sex...

234
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,712
...is if you're sent to prison
and you have a conjugal visit.

235
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,995
Yeah, conjugal-visit sex.
That is happening.

236
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,995
Look, I can tell you're very upset,
but I'm sorry, I'm not going.

237
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,073
Did you hear that?

238
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,798
I can't believe this. Look at this guy.
He's eating a sandwich.

239
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,269
Are you gonna eat those fries?

240
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,474
This is amazing.

241
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,719
Thank you. Thank you very much.

242
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,108
I'm going back in.

243
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,919
Feel better.

244
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,757
Poor bastard.

245
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,719
Good evening, Rabbi.

246
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,314
Good evening. And how does
this evening find you?

247
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,072
Well, Rabbi. Well.

248
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,754
I trust you're here
to see your friend, Elaine?

249
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,230
- Yeah, that's right.
- I hope she's feeling better.

250
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,634
What do you mean?

251
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,597
- She didn't tell you?
- No.

252
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,953
Well, it seems the engagement
of her friend George...

253
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,429
...has left her feeling
bitter and hostile.

254
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,189
- Is that so?
- Oh, yes.

255
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,271
In fact, she told me
that she wishes...

256
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,670
...she was the one
who was getting married.

257
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,799
Really?

258
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,509
- She came off as pretty desperate.
- I didn't know any of this.

259
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,673
Apparently, she doesn't think much
of this George fellow either.

260
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,436
I recall the word "loser" peppered
throughout our conversation.

261
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,511
Well, this all comes as news to me.

262
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,271
- Hi.
- Hi, how was your day?

263
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,873
Good. Good day.

264
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,793
- How was your day?
- Oh, it was okay.

265
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,192
- So, what's going on?
- Oh, nothing much, you know.

266
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,636
I went over to Jerry's.
You know, talked to Jerry.

267
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,548
Could l...?
Could I talk to you for a minute?

268
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,199
Yeah, sure.

269
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,833
All right.

270
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,192
You see, this is the thing.

271
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,109
I just feel like I can't do this
in December.

272
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:45,398
I just feel like I need a little more time
because I feel like I'm not ready yet.

273
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,154
I'm frightened and I'm scared.

274
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,519
And I just feel we need a little
more time to get to know each other.

275
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,672
But I could do it in March.
I promise. I promise.

276
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,230
No more postponements. I just
need three more months, please.

277
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,960
Oh, George, George.

278
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,394
Of course.

279
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,870
Of course it can wait till March
if that's what you want.

280
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,429
- Yeah?
- Oh, don't worry.

281
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,559
Yes, of course, of course.

282
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,352
I have that magazine article for you.

283
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,669
You know, I had a little talk
with the rabbi outside.

284
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,910
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

285
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,753
Understand you had
a little talk with him too.

286
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,638
Yeah, we talked earlier.

287
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,394
Yes, I know, I know.

288
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,876
- What does that mean?
- Nothing. Nothing.

289
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,675
- He didn't mention...?
- Yes, he did.

290
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,674
- He told you about the conversation?
- Oh, we had quite a little chat.

291
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,355
- He told you about...?
- Yes, how you are jealous of George.

292
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,875
How you wish you were
getting married instead of him.

293
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,553
He told you that? How could he?

294
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,359
And it didn't take much
prodding either, I have to say.

295
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,398
- Can he do that?
- He did.

296
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,155
But he's a rabbi. How can a rabbi
have such a big mouth?

297
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,072
That's what's so fascinating.

298
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,076
You better finish your
little caffe latte there.

299
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,276
- They'll never let you in with it.
- Why not?

300
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,352
Because they don't allow
outside drinks into the movie.

301
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,353
- Well, that's stupid.
- That's the rule.

302
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,432
Yeah, well, we'll just see if
we can't get around that.

303
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,830
Oh, Elaine, come in, come in.

304
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,510
- So nice to see you again.
- Yeah.

305
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,911
Can I offer you some
kasha varnishkes?

306
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,356
No, no. Listen, Rabbi,
I'd like to ask you a question.

307
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,433
Why? Why did you tell my friend
Jerry what I talked to you about?

308
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,230
- Was that a problem for you?
- Of course it was problem for me!

309
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,677
You didn't...? You didn't tell
anyone else about this, did you?

310
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,751
Well, let's see...

311
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,275
I seem to recall a conversation
with Mrs. Winston in 1 F.

312
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,429
Mrs. Winston?

313
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,030
Yes, we were waiting
for our mail to arrive...

314
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,555
...and I happened to mention
to her...

315
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,473
...how you felt it was never
going to "happen" for you.

316
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,156
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't
mention anything to him, did you?

317
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,469
Don Ramsey?

318
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,677
You know, that tall good-looking guy,
he lives on the fifth floor?

319
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,478
Oh, him.

320
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,950
Well, this morning I happened
to find myself in the elevator with him.

321
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,076
Oh, my God, you didn't.

322
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,113
Excuse me.

323
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,277
Pardon me. Excuse us.

324
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,073
My coffee!

325
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,628
Hey, hey, what's going on?
What just happened here?

326
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,915
Nothing. Nothing.

327
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,799
What do you got? One of those
caffe lattes in your shirt?

328
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,952
I don't have anything. What?
Ask him.

329
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,592
All right. Come on, coffee boy.

330
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,194
- What?
- Come on, now. Here we go.

331
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,039
I mean, the whole thing is a mess.
He told everyone in the building.

332
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,111
I ran into that cute guy
on the fifth floor...

333
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,635
...I mean, he could barely
bring himself to nod.

334
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,515
Elaine, if I could say a word here
about the Jewish people.

335
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,114
That man in no way
represents our ability...

336
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,068
...to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip
and keep it to ourselves.

337
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,992
You didn't say anything
to George, did you?

338
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,354
No.

339
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,478
About how you wish it was you who
was getting married instead of him.

340
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,599
- Feelings of resentment, hostility.
- Yeah, yeah. So what?

341
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:50,394
- Hey.
- Georgie, congratulations!

342
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,314
Oh, my God, I haven't seen you
since it happened.

343
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,914
I couldn't be happier for you.

344
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,708
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

345
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,351
Oh, come on. Come on.
You really, really deserve it.

346
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,672
Deserve?
I don't know about deserve.

347
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,829
Are you kidding?

348
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,798
I have seen the changes in you
the past couple of years.

349
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,748
Man, you have grown.
You've matured.

350
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,837
Yeah, I guess I'm getting older.

351
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,795
Well, I just think it's wonderful.
Honestly.

352
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,397
I've gotta run, but please,
please give my best to Susan.

353
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,788
My most just...

354
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,315
...heartfelt congratulations.
- Yeah, thanks.

355
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,913
Listen, if you ever get a date...

356
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,594
...maybe the four of us
could go out together sometime.

357
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,238
Yes. Yes, yes. Sure.

358
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,073
Wasn't there some guy in your
building that you said you liked?

359
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,435
He lived up on the fifth floor
or something?

360
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,636
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
- Yeah.

361
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,959
- Boy, she is something, isn't she?
- Yeah, she's something else.

362
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,509
Hey, so, what happened?
Did you hold your ground or...?

363
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,878
- Nope. I wept like a baby.
- What?

364
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,157
Well, I started to tell her, and then
all of a sudden, for some reason...

365
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,072
...I just burst into tears.

366
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,674
- You cried?
- I bawled uncontrollably.

367
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,355
I just poured my guts out. And
I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible.

368
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,029
I never realized how powerful
these tears are.

369
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,476
I could have postponed it
another five years if I wanted to.

370
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,035
- Hey.
- Hey.

371
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,589
Sorry about that movie thing.
I was joking around.

372
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,193
Sorry? Are you kidding?

373
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,998
You did me the biggest favour
of my life.

374
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,869
I spoke to a lawyer.
We're suing for millions.

375
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,999
- Suing? What for?
- The coffee was too hot.

376
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,077
- It's supposed to be hot.
- Not that hot.

377
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,478
The prophet Isaiah tells us
that without friends...

378
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,552
...our lives are empty
and meaningless.

379
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,996
Wait a minute. That's the rabbi
from Elaine's building.

380
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,355
I just met this guy the other day.

381
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,115
A young lady I know,
let's call her Elaine...

382
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,959
...happened to find herself
overwhelmed...

383
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,079
...with feelings of resentment
and hostility for her friend...

384
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,878
...let's call him George.

385
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,038
She felt that George
was somewhat of a loser...

386
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:19,037
...and that she was the one
who deserved to be married first.

387
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,070
She also happened to mention to me
that her friend had wondered...

388
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,109
...if going to a prostitute while you're
engaged is considered cheating.

389
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,352
His feeling was...

390
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,556
...they're never going
to see each other again...

391
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,915
...so, what's the difference?

392
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,989
But that is a subject
for another sermon.

393
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,869
And now I'd lik e to close
with a psalm.
