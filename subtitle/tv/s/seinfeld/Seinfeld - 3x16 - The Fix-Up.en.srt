1
00:00:02,272 --> 00:00:03,537
I never really understood...

2
00:00:04,957 --> 00:00:06,561
...the importance of the conductor.

3
00:00:06,722 --> 00:00:10,169
Between you and me,
what the hell is this guy doing?

4
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:13,960
Do you really need somebody
waving a stick in your face...

5
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:17,038
...to play the violin?
Does that really help you out?

6
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:20,184
I could see how we need him
at the beginning, okay?

7
00:00:20,378 --> 00:00:21,719
Tap, tap, tap.

8
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,749
"Start." Okay.
I could see how you need that.

9
00:00:24,904 --> 00:00:27,970
But once we're going, okay.
Once it's all happening...

10
00:00:28,127 --> 00:00:29,697
...what do we need him for then?

11
00:00:29,853 --> 00:00:34,522
I don't see the cellist looking up,
"I'm confused. I don't know what to do."

12
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:37,446
And the conductor goes,
"Do this. Like this..."

13
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:40,089
"Oh, okay, thank you.
Thank you very much."

14
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:46,838
Why try anymore?
There's no sense to it.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,875
I'll never meet anybody.
I should accept it.

16
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,062
- Oh, yes, you will.
- No, I won't.

17
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:53,435
Yeah, maybe you won't.

18
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:57,384
It's hard enough to meet a woman
you dislike, much less like.

19
00:00:59,352 --> 00:01:01,227
- Are my nostrils getting bigger?
- No.

20
00:01:01,385 --> 00:01:05,137
See, why must it be so difficult?
Why all this tension and hostility?

21
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:09,094
Why can't I just walk up to a woman
and say, " Hi, I'm George.

22
00:01:09,248 --> 00:01:11,081
How are you?" Is that so terrible?

23
00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:13,115
H... H... Hi.

24
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:15,377
Hi. Hi.

25
00:01:18,532 --> 00:01:20,287
- There's no men out there.
- I know.

26
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,006
The problem is that the good ones
know they're good.

27
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,392
They know they're in demand.

28
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:28,541
They're not interested in confining
themselves to one person.

29
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:30,836
I hate the good ones.

30
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:32,100
Is Jerry a good one?

31
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:35,057
That's a good question.
I think he thinks he is.

32
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:38,164
The mediocre ones are available...

33
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:40,125
...but so insecure
about not being a good one...

34
00:01:40,282 --> 00:01:42,234
...that they always go,
"I'm not good enough for you.

35
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:46,679
What are you doing with me?"
Eventually I just go, "You're right."

36
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:50,973
Maybe you need somebody
between good and mediocre.

37
00:01:51,138 --> 00:01:52,861
No, maybe I need somebody
who has nothing.

38
00:01:53,017 --> 00:01:56,770
Somebody who just appreciates being
with me because he's so desperate.

39
00:02:00,306 --> 00:02:03,327
It's gotten to the point where I'm
flirting with operators on the phone.

40
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:07,014
I almost made a date with one.

41
00:02:07,172 --> 00:02:08,546
Oh, so there's still hope.

42
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:11,882
I don't want hope. Hope is killing me.

43
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,800
My dream is to become hopeless.

44
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,104
The hopeless don't care.

45
00:02:16,263 --> 00:02:18,827
When you don't care,
that indifference makes you attractive.

46
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:22,590
- So hopelessness is the key.
- It's my only hope.

47
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:25,312
You see, I wouldn't really mind
so much...

48
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,964
...but I feel badly for my mother.

49
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:29,453
If my mother weren't around,
it wouldn't be so bad.

50
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:33,365
But, I'm telling you, if I'm not married
by the time I'm 40, I'll have to kill her.

51
00:02:33,564 --> 00:02:36,510
Because it's the only fair thing to do.

52
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:38,931
I just couldn't put her through that.

53
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:41,809
At least you're not bitter.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,342
Who says I'm not bitter?

55
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:47,442
- Aren't you too young to be bitter?
- No, you can be young and bitter.

56
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:51,474
Just maybe not as bitter as I'll be
10 years from now.

57
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,580
But I'm bitter.

58
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,502
Anyway, don't tell anyone.

59
00:02:57,615 --> 00:03:00,408
Don't worry. Your bitterness
is safe with me.

60
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,707
Okay. Order me a piece of cake.

61
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,663
I'm gonna go throw up.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,145
Look at my hands.

63
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:14,646
Look.

64
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:16,750
Filthy from the paper.

65
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:20,741
They should give you a Wet-Nap when
you buy one, like at those rib joints.

66
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:24,385
- What did you do last night?
- Went out with George. You?

67
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,115
Went out with Cynthia.

68
00:03:26,424 --> 00:03:27,569
What did you talk about?

69
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:31,596
Oh, you know, the usual.
The Federal Reserve, the rain forest.

70
00:03:34,134 --> 00:03:36,044
Cynthia felt we should nuke
the rain forest.

71
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:39,075
Get rid of it in one fell swoop
so we could eliminate it...

72
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:41,036
...as a subject of conversation.

73
00:03:42,075 --> 00:03:44,562
- What about you?
- We brushed on that.

74
00:03:46,755 --> 00:03:49,285
Actually, George was in rare form.

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,654
He just can't find anybody.

76
00:03:51,818 --> 00:03:53,269
I know. Cynthia too.

77
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:55,720
- She's really given up.
- George too.

78
00:04:00,756 --> 00:04:02,970
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, right.

79
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:08,114
- I've never fixed anybody up.
- Me neither.

80
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:11,526
And I am not about to
start with George.

81
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:16,286
Well, why wouldn't you start
with George?

82
00:04:16,445 --> 00:04:17,939
You think she's too good for George?

83
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:19,890
I didn't say "too good," did I?

84
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,113
- You implied it.
- I didn't say it.

85
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:23,956
If you think she's too good
for George...

86
00:04:24,117 --> 00:04:26,877
...you are dead wrong. Dead wrong.

87
00:04:28,107 --> 00:04:29,558
Who is she?

88
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:31,933
- Who is he?
- He's George.

89
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:34,542
- She's Cynthia.
- So what?

90
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:37,649
What, you don't think
she's beautiful?

91
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,876
What's with the eyebrows?

92
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,671
You know what your problem is?
Your standards are too high.

93
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,321
I went out with you.

94
00:04:50,662 --> 00:04:53,499
That's because my standards
are too low.

95
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:59,514
And by the way,
women kill for eyebrows like that.

96
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:03,397
Do you know that?
Women pluck their real eyebrows...

97
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:06,311
...out of their head one by one...

98
00:05:06,467 --> 00:05:09,685
...until they're bald, Jerry,
bald above the eyes.

99
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,908
And then they paint in these eyebrows
to look like that.

100
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:15,170
Well, let me tell you something
about George.

101
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,204
He is fast.

102
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:19,615
He can run like the wind.

103
00:05:19,854 --> 00:05:21,032
And he's strong.

104
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:24,034
I've seen him lift 100 pounds over
his head without even knowing it.

105
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:27,327
You wouldn't know it to look at him,
but George can bait a hook.

106
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:29,703
- He can really do that?
- Come on, let's do it.

107
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:31,393
I think they'll really get along.

108
00:05:31,554 --> 00:05:35,078
- What, are you into this?
- Yeah, come on, it's a good match.

109
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:37,877
Wait. They'll be telling us how
their dates went.

110
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,531
Are we gonna share
that information?

111
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:40,984
Naturally.

112
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:45,929
We're going to tell each other
everything? Every secret?

113
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,353
Everything.

114
00:05:48,126 --> 00:05:50,613
- What if it worked out?
- Yeah, right

115
00:05:53,496 --> 00:05:55,176
Out of the question.

116
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:56,788
Out of the question.

117
00:05:57,064 --> 00:06:00,010
- Why?
- No. I'm not going to do that.

118
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:02,735
It's one step away from personal ads.

119
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:04,767
Then prostitutes.

120
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:08,146
No! No! I am not going
down that road.

121
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,051
What does she look like?

122
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:17,809
- She's good-looking.
- How good-looking?

123
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,650
- Very good-looking.
- Really good-looking?

124
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:22,069
- Really very good-looking.
- Would you take her out?

125
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,952
- Yes, I would.
- You hesitated.

126
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:27,555
- What hesitate? I didn't hesitate.
- Something's up. You hesitated.

127
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:29,775
I'm telling you, she's good-looking.

128
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,729
- What about the body?
- Good body. Nice body.

129
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,768
- How nice?
- Nice. Pretty nice.

130
00:06:34,963 --> 00:06:38,062
- Really good?
- Really very nice and good.

131
00:06:43,326 --> 00:06:45,692
- What about personality?
- Good personality.

132
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:49,571
Funny. Bright.

133
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:51,532
I don't want anyone smarter than me.

134
00:06:51,688 --> 00:06:54,405
How could she be smarter than you?

135
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,120
All right, let's see. Let's see.
What else? What else?

136
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:02,043
What does she do?

137
00:07:02,429 --> 00:07:04,109
First of all, what does he do?

138
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,841
He was in real estate.

139
00:07:05,996 --> 00:07:08,135
He's not working right now.

140
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:10,709
Oh! He's not working?
No. No. No.

141
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:12,548
How come he's not working?

142
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:15,350
Well, I mean, he got fired.

143
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,655
Why did he get fired?

144
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:24,245
Oh, right. Well...

145
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:27,322
He tried to... poison his boss.

146
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:29,081
Excuse me?

147
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:34,143
It's such a long story. Seriously,
he just had some problems at work.

148
00:07:34,306 --> 00:07:36,182
- Is he nuts?
- No, no, no.

149
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:39,361
He's a really, really funny guy.

150
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,822
What does he look like?

151
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:43,889
- Pardon?
- What does he look like?

152
00:07:45,124 --> 00:07:47,490
Well, he's got a lot of character
in his face.

153
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:50,951
He's short. He's stocky.

154
00:07:51,108 --> 00:07:52,253
He's fat.

155
00:07:52,412 --> 00:07:54,060
Is that what you're saying,
that he's fat?

156
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,432
Powerful.

157
00:07:55,596 --> 00:08:01,040
He is so powerful. He can lift
100 pounds right up over his head.

158
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,532
And, what else? What else?

159
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,981
Oh, right, well...

160
00:08:06,145 --> 00:08:10,248
He's, he's kind of...
Just kind of... Losing his hair.

161
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,087
- He's bald?
- No.

162
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:16,111
No, no, no. He's not bald.

163
00:08:16,272 --> 00:08:17,952
He's balding.

164
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:21,021
- So he will be bald?
- Yeah.

165
00:08:21,412 --> 00:08:24,401
- What kind of hair?
- You know, long, dark hair.

166
00:08:24,558 --> 00:08:25,899
Flowing?

167
00:08:27,051 --> 00:08:28,196
Flowing?

168
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:32,305
Is it flowing? I like flowing,
cascading hair.

169
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:35,635
Thick, lustrous hair
is important to me.

170
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:42,963
"Thick, lustrous hair
is important to me."

171
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:44,421
- Is that what you said?
- Right.

172
00:08:44,582 --> 00:08:46,076
Just clarifying.

173
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,143
Let me ask you this.

174
00:08:53,251 --> 00:08:57,124
If you stick your hand in the hair,
is it easy to get it out?

175
00:09:00,463 --> 00:09:01,728
Do you want to get it out?

176
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:04,140
Or do you want to not be able
to get it out?

177
00:09:04,874 --> 00:09:07,514
- I'd like to be able to get it out.
- I think you'll get it out.

178
00:09:08,403 --> 00:09:09,701
What about the skin?

179
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:11,890
I need a good cheek.
I like a good cheek.

180
00:09:12,623 --> 00:09:14,303
She's got a fine cheek.

181
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:15,959
Is there a pinkish hue?

182
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:22,595
- A pinkish hue?
- Yes, a rosy glow.

183
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:24,966
There's a hue.

184
00:09:25,742 --> 00:09:28,993
She's got great eyebrows.
Women kill to have her eyebrows.

185
00:09:30,805 --> 00:09:32,453
Who cares about eyebrows?

186
00:09:35,217 --> 00:09:37,431
Is she sweet? I like sweet.

187
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:40,313
But not too sweet.
You could throw up from that.

188
00:09:43,464 --> 00:09:45,417
I don't think you'll throw up.

189
00:09:46,648 --> 00:09:48,753
She likes to throw up.

190
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,995
- Has he ever been married?
- No.

191
00:09:57,773 --> 00:09:59,343
Has he been close?

192
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:02,604
He once spent a weekend
with a woman.

193
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:08,195
He didn't really try
to poison his boss.

194
00:10:08,475 --> 00:10:10,046
Yeah, he did.

195
00:10:14,229 --> 00:10:16,181
We had an incredible
phone conversation.

196
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:17,910
We talked for, like, 20 minutes.

197
00:10:18,065 --> 00:10:20,705
I threw away my notes
in the middle of the call.

198
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:25,229
I thought she had
a great voice timbre.

199
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:26,689
Is it "timbre" or "tambre"?

200
00:10:26,849 --> 00:10:29,686
- I think it's tambre.
- Why'd I think timbre?

201
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:31,216
She could do voice-overs.

202
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:32,827
You didn't tell me about her voice?

203
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:35,747
- I didn't notice the voice.
- It's mellifluous.

204
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:38,274
So, Saturday night.

205
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:40,496
She had to be impressed
by that conversation.

206
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:43,299
It was a great performance.
I am unbelievable on the phone.

207
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:47,790
On the date, they should just have two
phones on the table at the restaurant.

208
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:50,209
- Hi.
- Hi!

209
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:54,082
- Out we go Saturday night.
- I know.

210
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:58,112
- So, what did she say?
- You're getting together Saturday night.

211
00:10:59,609 --> 00:11:01,518
- That's it?
- Yeah.

212
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,861
- She didn't mention the conversation?
- No.

213
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:08,538
See? I don't get that.

214
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:12,297
We had a relaxed, stimulating, great
conversation. She doesn't mention it?

215
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:13,604
- Why not mention it?
- What?

216
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:15,215
She could have mentioned it.

217
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:18,397
All right. All right. I'll go on the date,
but that's that.

218
00:11:23,469 --> 00:11:25,301
You know my friend Bob Sacamano?

219
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:29,445
- The guy from Jersey.
- He just got a job at a condom factory.

220
00:11:30,527 --> 00:11:32,403
Look at this. He gave me a gross.

221
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,613
- What will you do with all of them?
- Oh, well...

222
00:11:43,838 --> 00:11:45,256
Take some, Jerry. Grab them.

223
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:48,018
No, thanks. They look like
they came out of a cereal box.

224
00:11:48,173 --> 00:11:51,162
Come on, Elaine, here.
Take half a bag.

225
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:54,076
Half a bag?

226
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,449
What am I, a hooker?

227
00:11:57,993 --> 00:12:00,055
Anyway, they look kind of cheap.

228
00:12:01,177 --> 00:12:03,086
I'll take one.

229
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,157
It's possible.

230
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:12,789
The problem with the condom
is still buying them.

231
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:17,012
I think we should have, like,
a secret signal with the druggist.

232
00:12:17,173 --> 00:12:19,660
You walk into the store,
go to the counter. He looks at you.

233
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,467
And if you go like this:

234
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,569
He puts them in the bag
for you. That's it.

235
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,017
Show up there with your little
shaving cream, your little toothpaste.

236
00:12:29,179 --> 00:12:30,554
"How are you today?"

237
00:12:33,744 --> 00:12:36,035
"Have a nice day." "You too."

238
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,878
So where are they? It's 11:45.
They should be back by now.

239
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:43,488
- What did they do?
- I think they went out to dinner.

240
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,741
Oh, wait. I got another call.
That must be him.

241
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:47,475
- Hello.
- It's me. I just got home.

242
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:48,928
Hold on.

243
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:51,997
- It's George. He just got home.
- Yeah. I got Cynthia on the line.

244
00:12:52,157 --> 00:12:55,757
- I'll call you back when I'm done.
- Remember our pact: full disclosure.

245
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,443
Of course.

246
00:12:57,988 --> 00:12:59,210
Yeah, go ahead.

247
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:02,240
I'm gonna tell you,
but I made a pact with Cynthia.

248
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,275
We swore we wouldn't tell
you and Elaine.

249
00:13:04,432 --> 00:13:06,417
- You can tell. I'll vault it.
- It's in the vault?

250
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,417
I'm locking the vault. What? Come on.

251
00:13:10,647 --> 00:13:13,177
- We had sex.
- Oh, my God, you had sex?

252
00:13:13,332 --> 00:13:14,979
- How did that happen?
- I don't know.

253
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,661
I closed my eyes and made a move.

254
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:18,044
- At your apartment?
- Yeah.

255
00:13:18,204 --> 00:13:20,004
- She didn't stay over?
- No. She left.

256
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,615
Listen, you can't mention
any of this to Elaine.

257
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:25,256
Cynthia will kill me. We made a deal.

258
00:13:25,684 --> 00:13:26,829
Oh, my God.

259
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:29,050
He was uncomfortable
because it was our first time.

260
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:32,159
So he felt he'd perform better
if we did it in the kitchen.

261
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,923
- What?
- He says the kitchen...

262
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:35,765
...is the most sociable room
in the house.

263
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:37,103
And he was serious.

264
00:13:37,614 --> 00:13:40,144
- So how was it?
- How good could it be?

265
00:13:40,299 --> 00:13:42,361
My head was on a hot plate.

266
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:44,626
I got another call. Must be Jerry.

267
00:13:44,787 --> 00:13:47,961
- Oh, don't you tell him any of this.
- Yeah, okay.

268
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:51,604
- Hello?
- So, what did she say?

269
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:54,452
- What did he have to say?
- He said he had a good time.

270
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:56,822
- Her too.
- Oh, good.

271
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:58,436
- Anything else?
- No.

272
00:13:58,865 --> 00:14:00,850
- You?
- No.

273
00:14:01,243 --> 00:14:03,382
- You sure?
- Yeah.

274
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:06,422
- You?
- Yeah.

275
00:14:07,995 --> 00:14:10,526
All right, well...

276
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:13,164
I guess everything is under control.

277
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:15,432
Yeah. Okay then.

278
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,812
Alrighty.

279
00:14:17,086 --> 00:14:18,428
- Good night.
- Good night.

280
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:24,941
I left three messages.
I can't believe this woman.

281
00:14:25,103 --> 00:14:28,354
We have sex, she leaves 10 minutes
later, then I never hear from her again.

282
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,088
What kind of a person does this?

283
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,226
She used me. I feel cheap and violated.

284
00:14:38,414 --> 00:14:40,825
- I'm gonna do something about this.
- What are you gonna do?

285
00:14:40,984 --> 00:14:42,817
Never mind. Disgraceful.

286
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:47,539
Leaves you sitting there on the kitchen
floor like some kind of roach trap.

287
00:14:47,966 --> 00:14:49,918
Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.

288
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:52,105
Sir. Whatever.

289
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:54,369
She's not gonna get away with this.

290
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,853
I keep racking my brain
to try to figure out what I did.

291
00:14:58,016 --> 00:14:59,696
I was smart. I was funny.

292
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,690
I made great small talk
with the waitress...

293
00:15:01,852 --> 00:15:04,219
...so she could see I could relate
to the commoners.

294
00:15:04,384 --> 00:15:05,987
I'm a man of the people.

295
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:07,638
- I'm gonna call her.
- Don't call.

296
00:15:07,798 --> 00:15:10,438
- No, I'm calling her.
- No, Jerry, I don't want you to.

297
00:15:10,598 --> 00:15:12,551
- Get away from me.
- Give me the phone.

298
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,545
- You wanna fight me?
- Jerry, I'm gonna kill you.

299
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,456
Hey, hey, hey!

300
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:19,266
Hey, come on, Jerry, George.
Stop it.

301
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:20,910
I'll just call her when you leave.

302
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:22,216
It's none of your business!

303
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:24,437
- It is so my business.
- Give me that!

304
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,280
Stop it, boys!

305
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:30,889
I don't want another word
from either of you.

306
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:33,073
- Tell him...
- Hey, hey, hey!

307
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,743
The next one of you that opens your
mouth, you'll have to deal with me.

308
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:43,198
I bet I know what this is about.
It's about a woman, isn't it?

309
00:15:43,511 --> 00:15:44,930
- Yeah, but...
- You see!

310
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:46,840
This is exactly what they want
to do to you.

311
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:48,682
They play one against the other.

312
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:50,682
You can't let them
manipulate you like that.

313
00:15:50,838 --> 00:15:52,135
- But, Kramer...
- No, no, no!

314
00:15:52,296 --> 00:15:53,943
I want you guys to shake hands.

315
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:56,663
Come on, there are plenty women
out there for all of us.

316
00:15:56,899 --> 00:15:58,001
Shake.

317
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,960
Yes! You see?

318
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:02,684
Isn't that better than fighting?
Animosity?

319
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:05,605
You wanna fight with somebody,
you fight with me.

320
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:10,784
By the way, those condoms I gave you?
They're defective. Don't use them.

321
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:18,101
- What?
- Yeah.

322
00:16:18,265 --> 00:16:20,021
- Defective?
- Defective.

323
00:16:20,183 --> 00:16:22,398
How could you give me
a defective condom?

324
00:16:23,674 --> 00:16:25,430
I didn't even know
they were defective.

325
00:16:25,592 --> 00:16:27,577
- Didn't think you'd use them.
- What do you mean...?!

326
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:29,840
Take it easy.

327
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:31,804
Just spread out!

328
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:42,541
Don't worry. If anything was wrong,
she'd have called you.

329
00:16:44,197 --> 00:16:45,648
I missed my period.

330
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,757
Oh, my God!

331
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:51,442
I am very worried. I am never late.

332
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,357
But he used a condom, right?

333
00:16:53,518 --> 00:16:56,158
I know, but these things
aren't always foolproof.

334
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:59,192
Oh, no.

335
00:17:00,807 --> 00:17:02,028
What?

336
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,485
Was it blue?

337
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,165
Yeah. How'd you know?

338
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,049
Just a hunch.

339
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:18,565
It says "twist-off."
Twist off! Twist! Off!

340
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:22,169
Oh, hi. Soda?

341
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:24,315
No, thanks.

342
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,774
So tell me.

343
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,410
What's the problem with your little
flaky friend? She doesn't return calls?

344
00:17:31,303 --> 00:17:33,103
Who are you to talk
about her like that?

345
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,059
She'll call him when she's
good and ready.

346
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,087
- You don't even know her.
- Oh, I know her.

347
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:38,503
I know her type.

348
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:41,075
Her type? What type?

349
00:17:41,238 --> 00:17:42,656
The type that doesn't return calls.

350
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,833
I knew we shouldn't have done it.
It was a bad idea. I told you.

351
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:48,712
You told me? You pushed
this whole thing on me.

352
00:17:48,872 --> 00:17:50,093
It was your idea.

353
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:52,391
I was just helping your bitter,
twisted friend.

354
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:54,045
She's not bitter.

355
00:17:54,204 --> 00:17:55,884
Bitter's a judgment call.
She's twisted.

356
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:59,187
Twisted? God, I did you a favour!

357
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:02,027
You said they had a good time.
What else are you keeping from me?

358
00:18:02,183 --> 00:18:04,713
- Are you calling me a liar?
- I'm calling you one if you are.

359
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:06,624
- Are you?
- Get your finger out of my face.

360
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:08,738
- Get yours out.
- I don't care.

361
00:18:08,896 --> 00:18:11,154
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

362
00:18:11,312 --> 00:18:13,800
Hey, hey, hey! Come on, stop it!

363
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,792
Come on. Break it up!

364
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,707
Hey, hey!

365
00:18:18,255 --> 00:18:20,055
What's the matter with you?

366
00:18:21,094 --> 00:18:25,425
Now, don't you two see
that you're in love with each other?

367
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:29,721
I mean, why can't you
face that already?

368
00:18:29,879 --> 00:18:32,486
You're running around looking
for something not even there...

369
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,586
...when everything you dream of
is right here in front of you.

370
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,471
Now why can't you admit that?

371
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:40,843
By the way, when you see George,
give him these. These'll work.

372
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:45,603
I knew those condoms
were defective!

373
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:48,674
How did you know
they were defective?!

374
00:18:48,943 --> 00:18:52,925
Because! Because she missed
her period!

375
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,417
She missed her period?

376
00:18:58,572 --> 00:19:00,252
Oh, my God!

377
00:19:00,643 --> 00:19:02,291
I can't believe it.

378
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:05,049
I'm a father! I did it!

379
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,659
My boys can swim!

380
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:10,616
I can do it! I can do it!
I'm a father!

381
00:19:15,297 --> 00:19:17,980
So he shows up. He's all out of breath.
He's dishevelled.

382
00:19:18,135 --> 00:19:22,161
And tells me that whatever happens,
whatever I decide is fine with him...

383
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:24,080
...and I could depend on him...

384
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:27,224
...and that he'd support me
in whatever way I need.

385
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,989
Elaine, I was speechless.

386
00:19:30,449 --> 00:19:33,471
Wow. Wow. You see?
You think you know somebody.

387
00:19:33,633 --> 00:19:37,036
I said to him, " I really appreciate this,
but I just got my period."

388
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,727
- Yeah.
- So I asked him to come in...

389
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:40,153
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

390
00:19:40,307 --> 00:19:44,213
Sorry we're late. We got so
hung up in traffic. I'm sorry.

391
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:46,902
- What happened?
- Acting.

392
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:51,811
- Very mature.
- Thank you.

393
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:54,034
- Hi, Cynthia.
- Hi.

394
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,376
This is a great place to sit
you got here.

395
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,672
Best seat in the house.
Right next to the kitchen.

396
00:19:58,835 --> 00:20:00,668
Oh, stop it. Stop it.

397
00:20:03,132 --> 00:20:05,849
- So, what are these?
- We ordered appetizers. Start eating.

398
00:20:06,392 --> 00:20:07,767
Oh, fabulous.

399
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,675
This is good. Oh, this is good.

400
00:20:13,527 --> 00:20:15,512
Is that salt on this?

401
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:17,707
Is there salt on this?

402
00:20:17,939 --> 00:20:19,662
But have you ever fixed anybody up?

403
00:20:19,818 --> 00:20:21,574
Why do we do it? Why?

404
00:20:22,043 --> 00:20:23,570
You thought
they'd have a good time...

405
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:25,607
...and a little power trip
for you, isn't it?

406
00:20:26,301 --> 00:20:27,479
Now you're playing God.

407
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,480
Of course, God was
the first person to fix people up.

408
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:32,392
He fixed up Adam and Eve.

409
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:34,277
I'm sure he said to Adam,
"No, she's nice.

410
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:39,529
She's... Yes, she's very free
about her body.

411
00:20:39,689 --> 00:20:41,674
Doesn't really wear much.

412
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:44,859
She was going out with a snake.
I think that's over, though."

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
