1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,071
I'm not a foodie.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,434
I don't:

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,397
"Oh, this is too rare.
Oh, it's too salty."

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,598
Just eat it and shut up.

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,194
I'll eat anywhere,
whatever they're having.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,070
I've eaten rolls off of
room-service trays in hotel hallways.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,071
I have. That's not a joke.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,468
This is my life.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,719
I don't know, somebody left it.

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,599
Why would somebody poison a roll
and leave it in the hallway...

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,274
...for some comic coming down
at 2:00 in the morning?

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,391
Why would they do that?

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,271
Sometimes you go to a restaurant,
they put the check in a little book.

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,159
What is this,
the story of the bill?

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,353
"Once upon a time, there were some
very hungry people." What is this?

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,671
Little gold tassel hanging down.
Am I graduating from the restaurant?

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,398
What is this about?

18
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,153
You want some of mine?

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,916
- Take some of mine.
- Why do I get pesto?

20
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,275
Why do I think I'll like it?

21
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,998
I keep trying to like it.

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,674
- Like I have to like it.
- Who said you have to like it?

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,398
Everybody likes pesto.

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,472
You walk into a restaurant,
that's all you hear. Pesto. Pesto.

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,514
- I don't like pesto.
- Where was pesto 1 0 years ago?

26
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,559
Look at that guy.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,116
I'll bet you he's getting
hair transplants.

28
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,036
Anytime you see a guy that age
wearing a baseball cap, 1 0-1, plugs.

29
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,196
The thing about that painting
is with the colours and...

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,397
Oh, yeah, plugola.

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,074
One more thing about the car.
Let it warm up for a minute.

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,038
Yeah, that's a tough minute.

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,556
It's like waiting in the shower
for the conditioner to work.

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,631
I don't understand why
he couldn't take a cab.

35
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,678
- Who?
- Elaine is having...

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,239
...a houseguest.

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,356
She's picking him up
at the airport tonight.

38
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,557
- A guy?
- Yes, it's a guy.

39
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,156
He's from Yakima, right?

40
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,519
- Seattle.
- Everybody's moving to Seattle.

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,518
It's the pesto of cities. So?

42
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,674
Well, you tell.

43
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,989
Well, from what I can piece together,
our friend here met a gentleman...

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,196
- Ed.
- Who was in town...

45
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,557
...on a business venture, and...?

46
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,633
We shared
an interpersonal experience.

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,631
- Go on.
- So they went out a few times...

48
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,509
...but, apparently, when the fellow
returned home...

49
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,514
...he discovered that the Benes tattoo
does not wash off so easily.

50
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,035
On some people.

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,597
So he's coming to stay with her
for a week.

52
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,309
It was just gonna be a weekend,
but then, somehow, it became a week.

53
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,993
- Wait a second.
- All right, okay.

54
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,515
- All right, all right, okay.
- What happened?

55
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:02,437
Oh, the busboy left the menu
a little close to the candle.

56
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,953
I'm sorry for the disturbance.

57
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,351
- I'm never eating here again.
- Yeah.

58
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,273
- Nice going.
- Thank you.

59
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,075
- That ought to get us a free dessert.
- Yeah.

60
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,393
I think the busboy's in trouble.

61
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,276
Did I get him in trouble
because of what I said?

62
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,908
I just told him what happened.
He didn't do it on purpose.

63
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,359
He pointed at me.

64
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,353
- Why did they point at me?
- I said I would never eat here again...

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,431
...but he had to know I was kidding.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,991
I didn't say anything.

67
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,149
I can't believe it. He's going.
He's fired.

68
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,598
- Oh, I said it in a kidding way.
- I didn't know he'd get fired.

69
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,115
He'll probably kill his family
over this.

70
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,591
What if he's waiting for me outside?

71
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,432
He pointed at me.
Did you see him point?

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,716
Lot of ex-cons become busboys.

73
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,950
They seem to gravitate towards it.

74
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,872
- Was it my fault?
- Was it my fault?

75
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,397
Maybe I'll try that pesto.

76
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,671
Look, I feel bad for him too,
but he'll get another job.

77
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,957
Let's face it, it's not a profession
where you embellish your rásumá...

78
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,157
...and undergo a series
of gruelling interviews.

79
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,594
- Like you really know busboys.
- Oh, like you do.

80
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,228
- Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.
- Camp.

81
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,312
It was a fat camp.
Those kids depended on me.

82
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,157
- Elaine?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,400
Busboys are always changing jobs.
That's the business.

84
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,232
I know, I work with these guys.

85
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,630
I talk with them in the kitchens
at the comedy clubs.

86
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,313
Why don't you get him another job?

87
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,914
I'd love to. But I don't know
anything about him.

88
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,993
He could walk around the street
pricking people with pins.

89
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,311
I don't know if you people
are aware of this...

90
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,471
...but I am one clever chickadee.

91
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,312
What, did you get
the busboy's number?

92
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,836
His phone's been disconnected,
but I was able to obtain an address.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,151
1 324 Amsterdam Avenue,
apartment 4D.

94
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,071
Now, I did my job.

95
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,437
- May I have the car keys, please?
- How did you get all this?

96
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,478
Does the word "charm"
mean anything to you?

97
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,914
No.

98
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,228
Now you're going to his apartment?
I think this is nuts.

99
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,234
I'd like to apologize. I wanna tell him
I didn't mean to get him in trouble.

100
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,197
- So you're going now?
- Yeah.

101
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,157
I'm gonna see if there's anything
I can do.

102
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,390
Get him another job.
Maybe I'll hear of something.

103
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,596
Maybe the fat camp.

104
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,034
- You're not going?
- I would...

105
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,316
...but I have to pick up Ed
at the airport.

106
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,550
I just don't think
you should go alone.

107
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,188
- Can't you wait till after my set?
- It will take too long.

108
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,554
- Hey.
- Hey.

109
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,517
Take the K-Man.

110
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,636
A little support.

111
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,994
- I don't...
- What? What? Take me where?

112
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,912
Where?

113
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,475
Look, I really appreciate
your coming...

114
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,996
...but if you wouldn't mind...

115
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,031
...try not to say too much.

116
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,078
What am I gonna say?

117
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,553
I don't know.

118
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,552
Well, I'm not an idiot.

119
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,519
Certainly not.

120
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,793
Then we're cool.

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,479
Yeah.

122
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,949
Yeah, we're cool.

123
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,039
I'm sorry to bother you.
I was in the restaurant earlier...

124
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,670
...and I was wondering if I could
talk to you about what happened.

125
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,552
Thanks.

126
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,630
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
It's just that...

127
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,998
...I think I may have,
without realizing it...

128
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,154
...been responsible
for getting you fired.

129
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,079
And I just...

130
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,994
I wanted you to know that I did
not intend for that to happen.

131
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,279
He's a hell of a guy.

132
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,319
This is...

133
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,996
...a guy I know. Kramer.

134
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,758
Oh, my God.

135
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,832
Waterbed?

136
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,677
Anyway, I...

137
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,436
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm really sorry that happened.

138
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,991
And if I can help out in any way,
I'll certainly be glad to do that.

139
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,989
Well, I guess that's about it.

140
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,431
You got anything to drink?

141
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,559
- We really should be going.
- Let me get a glass of water.

142
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,313
Hurry up.

143
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,352
Paquita?

144
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,278
Paquita?

145
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,236
His cat's gone.

146
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,399
Who left the door open?

147
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,118
Who left the door open?

148
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,872
Come on! Come on! Help me look!

149
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,518
You know, the cats,
they run away all the time.

150
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,878
You know, my aunt, she had a cat,
ran away, showed up three years later.

151
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,712
You never know.

152
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,917
They got things in their brains.
They remember where they're from.

153
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,030
Unless somebody starts feeding her.
See, that's what you gotta worry about.

154
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,955
Once again, Antonio,
I can't even begin to say...

155
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,148
...how deeply, deeply sorry
I am about everything.

156
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,154
The job...

157
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,719
...the cat...

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,274
The lamp.

159
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,756
There's wire sticking out.

160
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,553
Yeah.

161
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,550
Here's my card.

162
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,637
I'm in real estate.

163
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,190
So if you're ever looking for
something bigger, something nicer...

164
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,671
Maybe not right away.

165
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,717
Anyway...

166
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,990
You ought to get that wire fixed.

167
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,432
I got the door.

168
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,390
George, stop worrying about this guy.
It wasn't your fault.

169
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,438
Come on. He's not stalking you.

170
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,549
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,075
He doesn't even know where you live.

172
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,913
Who told you to give him
your business card?

173
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,878
That's Elaine.

174
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,632
Kramer.

175
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,678
George wants to know when
you wanna go look for the cat again.

176
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,991
Well, it's been a week.
It's up to the cat now.

177
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,954
Kramer says it's up to the cat now.

178
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,599
It'll be on your conscience.

179
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,639
- Oh, how do you figure?
- How do you figure?

180
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,392
You're the one who left
the door open.

181
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,790
Why was I in charge
of closing the door?

182
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,599
Why was he in charge
of closing the door?

183
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,113
Because you came in after him.

184
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,352
- So?
- So?

185
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,474
- Last person in should close the door.
- Let me talk to him.

186
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,710
Talk... Call him from your house.

187
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,476
He's calling you now.

188
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,119
Okay.

189
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,957
Ed's downstairs.
Can I have the car keys?

190
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,869
- No " hello"?
- You got any aspirin?

191
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,154
Hello.

192
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,719
Now, lookit, you guarantee me...

193
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,792
...this car's gonna get me
to the airport tomorrow, no problem?

194
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,030
Guarantee? Hey, it's a car.

195
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,749
Because if there's even
the slightest chance of any problem...

196
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,071
...I don't wanna take it. If I don't
get this guy on a plane to Seattle...

197
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,916
...and out of my life, I'm gonna kill him
and anyone who tries to stop me.

198
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,908
So did you have
a nice week together?

199
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,479
I heard a little ping in the car last time.
What was that ping?

200
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,995
There's no ping.
Why are you so wacky?

201
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,750
Jerry, you cannot imagine
how much I hate this guy.

202
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,037
And he hasn't even done anything.
It's this situation.

203
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,397
He's a wonderful guy,
but I hate his guts.

204
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,271
So have you two been...?

205
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,239
No!

206
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,794
I told him I've been having my period
the last five days.

207
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,872
And I'm sleeping all squished
over on the edge of my bed.

208
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,759
But I've only got 1 4 hours to go,
and nothing can go wrong now.

209
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,912
I've taken care of everything.
I've confirmed the plane reservation...

210
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,116
...checked weather...
- What's your airport route?

211
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,350
I got it all mapped out.
I'm taking the tunnel.

212
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,790
What about the Van Wyck?

213
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,749
I spoke to a cab driver.

214
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,913
For 5 bucks, he turned me onto
the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.

215
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,232
Now look, his plane leaves at 1 0: 1 5,
we're getting up at about 8.

216
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,119
- Gives us enough time, right?
- You still using that alarm clock?

217
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,953
No, I bought a new one today.
It's got everything.

218
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,159
If you oversleep, a hand comes out
and slaps you in the face.

219
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,357
Flying doesn't make me nervous.
Driving to the airport...

220
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,080
...can make you very nervous.

221
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,470
Because when you're flying,
getting on a plane...

222
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,108
...if you miss that plane,
there's no alternative.

223
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,599
On the ground, you have options.

224
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,228
You have buses, you have taxis,
you have trains.

225
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,392
But when you're taking a flight,
if you miss it, that's it.

226
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,518
No airline goes, "Well, you missed
the flight. We do have a cannon...

227
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,911
...leaving in 1 0 minutes.
Would you be interested in that?

228
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,676
It's not a direct cannon. You have
to change cannons after you land."

229
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,238
"Sir, where are you going,
Chicago?

230
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,789
Oh, Dallas. All right. Wait a second.

231
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,197
Dallas, that's about Dallas. Texas,
anyway. You should hit Texas. Ready?

232
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,113
Get out of the net immediately...

233
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,475
...because we shoot the luggage in
right after you."

234
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,433
Get up. The alarm didn't go off.
You're gonna miss the plane, it's 9: 1 5.

235
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,195
- 9: 1 5?
- Yeah. It's 9: 1 5!

236
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,078
We'll never make it.
I'll leave tomorrow.

237
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,993
Tomorrow? Are you crazy?
No. Now, now, let's go.

238
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,957
Let's go. You get dressed,
you get dressed.

239
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,714
- Can I shower?
- Shower? Are you out of your mind?

240
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,189
I gotta shower. I'll feel dirty all day.

241
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,955
Forget the shower. The shower's out.
Just move it. Put your clothes on.

242
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,239
- Where are you going?
- The kitchen.

243
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,391
- The kitchen?
- Got a bag of cashews in there.

244
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,358
No, they're not making it.
Here, put your pants on.

245
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,238
- Put your pants on.
- What's the big deal?

246
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,676
- I'll go tomorrow or the next day.
- No, you have your ticket.

247
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,637
- You have to go now.
- We'll never make it.

248
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,989
- Don't say that.
- Well, it takes 45 minutes to get...

249
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,512
It takes 45 minutes to get there.
That will only leave me five minutes...

250
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,750
...to get to the plane.
- Shut up and pack!

251
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,992
And what if I don't make the plane?
You'll have left. Then what do I do?

252
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,912
You're talking too much.

253
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,071
- Where's my sweater?
- What?

254
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,872
- My brown sweater.
- What sweater?

255
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,270
- My brown sweater.
- You didn't bring a brown sweater.

256
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,829
- I got a brown sweater.
- Here. You want a sweater?

257
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,116
You want a brown sweater,
you got a brown sweater.

258
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,477
- I can't take your sweater.
- It's brown!

259
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,679
What are you doing?

260
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,912
No. There's no time for folding,
no time for folding. I think that's it.

261
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,833
- My shoes, you packed my shoes.
- Shoes? Shoes?

262
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,230
Shoes weren't invented till
the fourth century.

263
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,834
People walked around
for thousands of years without them!

264
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,833
I have this! Let's go. Let's go.

265
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,749
- Anywhere in the city?
- Anywhere in the city.

266
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,717
I'll tell you the best public toilet.

267
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,279
Okay...

268
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,839
...54th and Sixth.

269
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,075
Sperry-Rand building,
1 4th floor, Morgan Apparel.

270
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,834
Mention my name,
she'll give you the key.

271
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,277
All right, 65th and 1 0th.

272
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,632
Are you kidding?

273
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,553
Lincoln Center, Alice Tully Hall,
the Met.

274
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,870
Magnificent facilities.

275
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,039
I never knew I could drive like that.

276
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,510
I was going faster
than I've ever gone before.

277
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,672
And yet it all seemed
to be happening in slow motion.

278
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,354
I was seeing three
and four moves ahead...

279
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,469
...weaving in and out of lanes like an
Olympic skier on a gold-medal run.

280
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,875
I knew I was challenging
the very laws of physics.

281
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,112
At Queens Boulevard,
I took the shoulder.

282
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,118
At Jewel Avenue, I used the median.

283
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,716
I had it. I was there. And then...

284
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,276
...I hit the Van Wyck.

285
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,079
They say no one's ever beaten
the Van Wyck...

286
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,235
...but, gentlemen, I tell you this:

287
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,634
I came as close as anyone ever has.

288
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,115
And if it hadn't been
for that five-car pileup...

289
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,272
...on Rockaway Boulevard...

290
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,193
...that numbskull...

291
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,956
...would be on a plane
for Seattle right now...

292
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,078
...instead of looking
for a parking space...

293
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,435
...downstairs.

294
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,833
- You did everything.
- You tried.

295
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,194
The busboy's coming.

296
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,030
- The busboy's coming.
- The busboy's coming?

297
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,839
- You don't mean here.
- I buzzed him in. He's on his way up.

298
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,797
He's coming up?
I'll check you out later.

299
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,837
- Where are you going?
- I'm the one he wants.

300
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,151
- He's coming to settle the score.
- No. You three all know each other.

301
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,595
There's no point in me
getting involved at this stage.

302
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,718
No, he's not gonna do anything.
I guarantee it.

303
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,189
The hell with it! Let him kill me, l...

304
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,393
Antonio! Antonio, in here.

305
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,430
Hey, Antonio, how's it going?

306
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,392
Three nights ago...

307
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,630
...a gas main beneath
the restaurant exploded...

308
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,598
...killing five people in my section...

309
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,990
...including the busboy
who replaced me.

310
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,954
If I'm not fired that night
because of you...

311
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,590
...and your thoughtless,
stupid, insensitive remarks...

312
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,319
...it would have been me.

313
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,198
You saved my life!

314
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,039
Come on.

315
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,077
- Yeah?
- It's Eddie.

316
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,432
- He's coming up.
- And the same night of the accident...

317
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,431
...while looking for Paquita...

318
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,830
...I find a job in a restaurant
where they pay me...

319
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,036
...almost twice
what I was making before.

320
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,913
And, when I returned
to the apartment...

321
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,833
...Paquita, perhaps frightened
from the explosion...

322
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,151
...had miraculously returned.

323
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,594
Well...

324
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:22,833
...now I must go, for today
I am starting my new, wonderful job...

325
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,719
...and I am very late.

326
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,159
Thank you.

327
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,710
Thank you. Thank you all.

328
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,758
Hey, watch where you're going.
You almost knocked my head off.

329
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,831
Why don't you watch
where you're going, okay?

330
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,390
- Because you bumped into me.
- Who do you think you're talking to?

331
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,074
Hey, get your hands off me!

332
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,639
You go to hell!

333
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,593
He'll get another job.

334
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,314
He's a busboy.

335
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,272
It won't be for a while.

336
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,237
At least not till after the cast
comes off.

337
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,391
That fall down the stairs,
that's what did it.

338
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,993
That's not how it happened.

339
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,230
It's when he fell on him
with his knee.

340
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,073
That was awful. Poor Antonio.

341
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,754
Thanks.

342
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,395
So, much longer?

343
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,436
Till when? Till he goes back to Seattle
or till he can feed himself?

344
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,158
I guess it's not important.

345
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,596
Take care of yourselves.

346
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,797
I should probably get going too.

347
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,669
If I don't feed Paquita by 7,
she goes all over everything.

348
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,792
Take it easy.

349
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,313
Yeah.

350
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,918
How you doing?

351
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,913
First of all, I can't believe
that people actually do fight.

352
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,878
People have fistfights in life.
I can't really believe...

353
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,679
...that we have boxing, either.
It's really an amazing thing.

354
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,720
The problem with boxing,
you have two guys having a fight...

355
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,632
...that have no prior argument.

356
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,593
Why don't they have the boxers
come into the ring in little cars...

357
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,354
...drive around a bit,
have a little accident, they get out:

358
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,590
" Didn't you see my signal?
Look at that fender!"

359
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,432
Then you'd see a real fight.

360
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,391
