1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,873
You get to a point
with your parents...

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,472
...where all you can do with them
is eat. You can't talk anymore...

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,837
...but you wanna at least try
and keep your mouths moving.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,309
And they're so anxious for it,
you know. You come in:

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,311
"How was the plane?
You must be hungry.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,152
How did you sleep?
Ready for breakfast?"

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,954
My mother will argue with me
about what I like.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,157
"Can I have a piece of pumpkin pie?"
"You don't like pumpkin pie."

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,550
"Yes, I do."
"Since when?"

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,312
"What's the difference?
Can I have it?"

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,916
"No. I have never seen you eat
a piece of pumpkin pie."

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,196
Mr. Peterman sent me over here
for a physical...

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,476
...because as you may
or may not know...

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,752
...he and I are going on a trip
to Kenya.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,312
Africa.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,553
It's my first such mission
for the company.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,800
The Masai Bushmen
wear these great sandals...

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,428
...and we're gonna knock them off.

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,268
Not the Masai, the sandals.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,632
- I'll need a urine sample.
- Right.

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,429
Africa? Do you know how hot
it gets there?

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,915
Like 150 degrees.

23
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,674
Your skin is gonna be
simmering with boils.

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,916
Oh, come on.

25
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,559
You coming to The Tonight Show?

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,870
Yeah, yeah. My parents wanna
come too, is that okay?

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,435
- Sure. My parents will be there.
- The Tonight Show?

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,113
Yeah, they're in town.
You wanna go?

29
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,151
- Are you doing new material?
- No.

30
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,594
I don't think so.

31
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,953
Hey, the super's in my bathroom
changing my showerhead.

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,628
- Have they changed yours?
- No, he's doing mine next.

33
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,076
- They're low-flow, you know.
- Low-flow?

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,595
Well, I don't like the sound of that.

35
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,470
So, what are your parents
doing here in New York?

36
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,954
Well, they were humiliated.

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,634
After the impeachment,
my father left office in disgrace.

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,914
- So, what are their plans?
- Well, this is the problem.

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,958
They're moving into this new
development. Here's the pamphlet.

40
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,720
"Del Boca Vista." But they're
not quite ready to go back...

41
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,713
...so they're in seclusion here
for a while at Uncle Leo's.

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,512
The three of them
in that tiny apartment?

43
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,280
No, Leo's not there.
He's got a girlfriend, Lydia.

44
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,228
- In fact, he moved in with her.
- Uncle Leo's having regular sex?

45
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,954
Yeah, I know, it devalues
the whole thing.

46
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,512
- Hello.
- What time do we have to be...

47
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,159
...at The Tonight Show on Thursday?

48
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,195
- You gotta be there at 4:30.
- But it comes on at 11:30.

49
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,676
Yeah, well, they tape it in the
afternoon and then they air it at 11:30.

50
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,031
- How long they been doing this?
- Thirty years.

51
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,277
Helen, did you know that they
tape this thing in the afternoon?

52
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,471
All right. I'll see you later.

53
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,875
Georgie, how come your parents
never moved to Florida?

54
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,192
Yeah, that is odd, isn't it?

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,391
- Yeah, it is.
- I mean, they're retired.

56
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,516
There's no economic reason
for them to be here.

57
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,399
They have no friends.

58
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,278
No social reason for them
to be here.

59
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,711
- You're all grown-up.
- Yeah, they're through ruining my life.

60
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,996
What the hell
are they still doing here?

61
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,111
Let me see this pamphlet.

62
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,318
All right, I'll...

63
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,277
I'll get back to you.

64
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,238
- Hello?
- Where can I buy some ice?

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,072
Your father likes a lot of ice.

66
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,235
I don't know.
Maybe get an ice tray?

67
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,000
- I can do that.
- You know, Dad just called me.

68
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,276
Yeah, I know.
His phlebitis is acting up.

69
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,596
Yeah. All right.
Well, I got some people here.

70
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,233
- Okay.
- All right, bye.

71
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,674
- You see this?
- What?

72
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,876
Any thought pops into their head,
they call me...

73
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,951
...because it's a local call now.

74
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,118
I'm used to a 1200-mile buffer zone.

75
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,397
I can't handle this. Plus, I got
the dinners, I got the pop-ins.

76
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,075
- They pop in. It's brutal.
- Any idea when they're going back?

77
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,754
The only way out is if
Leo breaks up with his girlfriend...

78
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,832
...and moves back in. Then they
would have to go back to Florida.

79
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,269
How's that gonna happen?

80
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,672
It's about time you called your uncle.
We gotta do this once a week.

81
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,956
Once a week?

82
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,719
So how's Lydia?

83
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,598
She's a real tiger.

84
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,439
I don't know how you do it.

85
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,228
- What?
- Well, a man like you...

86
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,188
...limiting yourself to one woman.
I don't know. It's none of my business.

87
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,356
What are you talking about?

88
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,353
- Well...
- Look at this.

89
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,080
I told them medium rare.
It's medium.

90
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,477
- It happens.
- I bet that cook is an anti-Semite.

91
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,159
He has no idea who you are.

92
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,835
They don't just overcook
a hamburger, Jerry.

93
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,951
Fine. Anyway, the point
I was making...

94
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,271
...before Goebbels
made your hamburger here is this:

95
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,716
A man like you could be
dating women 20 years younger.

96
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,639
Come on, Uncle Leo,
I've seen the way women look at you.

97
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,549
When's the last time you looked
in the mirror? You're an Adonis.

98
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,870
You've got beautiful features,
lovely skin.

99
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,516
You're in the prime of your life here.
You should be swinging.

100
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,280
If I were you,
I'd tell this Lydia character:

101
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,754
"It's been real."

102
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,639
Move back into that bachelor pad
and put out a sign:

103
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,314
"Open for business."

104
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,113
Believe me, I thought about it...

105
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,159
...but she is so perfect in every way,
I can't see a flaw.

106
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,316
Well, keep looking.

107
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,757
Oh, hi, Mr. Peterman.

108
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,599
Do you realize how short
the Kalahari Bushmen are?

109
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,712
I'm gonna look like a giant
to those guys.

110
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,918
I'm afraid I have
some bad news, Elaine.

111
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,995
It appears you will not be
accompanying me to Africa.

112
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,635
What? Why not?

113
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,229
I'm afraid it's your urine, Elaine.

114
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,437
You've tested positive for opium.

115
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,631
- Opium?
- That's right, Elaine.

116
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,876
White Lotus. Yam-yam.

117
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,270
Shanghai Sally.

118
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,472
Well, that's impossible.
I've never done a drug in my life.

119
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,631
Dr. Strugatz must have
made a mistake.

120
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,432
Not a chance.

121
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,876
I'm afraid I'll just have to find someone
else to accompany me on my journey.

122
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,713
The Dark Continent
is no place for an addict, Elaine.

123
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,073
Obviously, Mr. Peterman,
there's something wrong with this test.

124
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,157
I don't take opium.

125
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,118
Let me take another one, please?
I'll call the doctor right now.

126
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,191
I'll take a pop urine test.

127
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,279
- All right, Elaine.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. Peterman.

128
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,790
I'll be ready in three minutes.

129
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,277
Boy, it's cold outside, huh?

130
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,113
Oh, these New York winters.

131
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,633
Bitter cold. Bitter.

132
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,593
I was out for five minutes before.
I couldn't feel my extremities.

133
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,075
What extremities?

134
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,356
You know what the temperature
in Florida is today?

135
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,158
Seventy-nine.

136
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,078
That's almost 80.

137
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,712
Yeah, I read someplace,
the life expectancy in Florida...

138
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,919
...is 81. And in Queens, 73.

139
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,759
So, George, why are you here?

140
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,238
What, I can't stop by
and visit my parents?

141
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,913
What's this?

142
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,078
That's where the Seinfelds
are moving. They got a great deal.

143
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,390
- Yeah?
- You know what they got in Florida?

144
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,913
Jai alai.

145
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,594
You bet on the games,
you clean up.

146
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,314
- I don't bet.
- Well, what about the dolphins?

147
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,959
You can swim
with the dolphins there.

148
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,230
I don't swim.

149
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,198
Well, you could pet them.

150
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,555
They come right out of the water
onto the sidewalks.

151
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,752
Are you trying to get rid of us?

152
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,072
"Rid"? Ma, come on.
The word is "care." "Care."

153
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,719
I care about your comfort.

154
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,353
Be it here in Queens...

155
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,159
...or 1200 miles away.

156
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,513
No?

157
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,350
Jerry. Jerry!

158
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,396
- You too, huh?
- Yeah.

159
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,989
These showers are horrible.
There's no pressure.

160
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,754
- I can't get the shampoo out.
- Me either.

161
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,589
If I don't have a good shower, I am not
myself. I feel weak and ineffectual.

162
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,591
- I'm not Kramer.
- You? What about me?

163
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,079
I got The Tonight Show tonight.

164
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,549
I'm gonna have to shower
in the dressing room.

165
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,277
- Where you going?
- Well, I gotta find another shower.

166
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,195
- They got you too?
- This is awful.

167
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,918
I'm not Newman.

168
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,754
- Oh, Elaine. Yeah.
- Kramer, you look terrible.

169
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,878
Yeah. I need the keys to your
apartment. I gotta take a shower.

170
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,117
- What's wrong with your shower?
- There's no water pressure.

171
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,515
- Why didn't you go see Jerry?
- Jerry's got nothing.

172
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,558
Newman's got nothing. You're
the one who's got the good stuff.

173
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:29,196
And I need it bad, baby, because I feel
like I got bugs crawling up my skin.

174
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,278
- Now, you gotta help me out.
- Not on my watch!

175
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,914
I won't have you turning my office
into a den of iniquity!

176
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,355
- What's wrong with you?
- Get your fix somewhere else!

177
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,830
Go on, beat it!

178
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,431
- Mr. Peterman, what are you doing?
- Elaine, you're out of control.

179
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,999
You need help.

180
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,716
I know what you're going through.

181
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,678
I, too, once fell under the spell
of opium.

182
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,314
It was 1979.
I was traveling the Yangtze...

183
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,232
...in search
of a Mongolian horsehair vest.

184
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,919
Oh, for God's sake.

185
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,476
I had got to the market after sundown.
All of the clothing traders had gone.

186
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,596
But a different sort of trader
still lurked.

187
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,957
"Just a taste," he said.
That was all it took.

188
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,869
Mr. Peterman, I don't know
what's going on here.

189
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,237
I am not addicted to anything.

190
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,670
Oh, Elaine.

191
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,594
The toll road of denial
is a long and dangerous one.

192
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,394
The price? Your soul.

193
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,630
Oh, and by the way, you have
till 5:00 to clear out your desk.

194
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,233
You're fired.

195
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,078
- All they serve is chicken?
- There's more food down the hall.

196
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,430
Here, wrap it up. We'll take it home.

197
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,231
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hi.

198
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,594
Hello, Seinfelds.

199
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,637
- Hello.
- Hi, Estelle.

200
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,400
This is your dressing room?
They treat you like Toscanini.

201
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,152
Oh, Jerry, I don't know
how you can do this.

202
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,151
I'm so nervous for you.

203
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,713
Actually, I'm drunk.

204
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,190
Hey. Hey, how is Florida, huh?

205
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,152
We just bought a new place
down there.

206
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,430
I know. We were looking
at the brochure.

207
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,312
- You what?
- Why, you thinking of moving?

208
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,556
- Not really.
- Because if you are, you shouldn't.

209
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,312
There's nothing available there.

210
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,399
Are you telling me there's not one
condo available in Del Boca Vista?

211
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,398
That's right.
They went like hotcakes.

212
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,232
- How'd you get yours?
- Got lucky.

213
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,473
Are you trying to keep us out
of Del Boca Vista?

214
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,511
I know this doesn't seem
like work to you...

215
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,717
...but if you'd conduct the psychopath
convention down the hall...

216
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,117
...so I could just get
a little personal space.

217
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,515
How could I have
tested positive twice?

218
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,518
Once, I can understand.
That's a mistake. But twice?

219
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,312
Yeah, it's hard to figure.

220
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,153
I mean, I've lost my job.
I can't go to Africa.

221
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,590
I was gonna meet
the Bushmen of the Kalahari.

222
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,756
- The Bushmen?
- And the Bushwomen.

223
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,155
Excuse me.
I couldn't help overhearing.

224
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,396
I notice you're eating
a poppy seed muffin there.

225
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,192
Yeah, I eat these muffins
all the time.

226
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,277
Well, you know what opium
is made from.

227
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,273
Poppies!

228
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,151
Welcome back.
Talking with Jerry Seinfeld.

229
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,629
Jerry, let me ask you,
I saw some people back there...

230
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,872
...they look lik e family. Is that family?
- I got some family backstage.

231
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,393
My family's nuts. They're crazy.

232
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,471
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

233
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,676
My Uncle Leo,
I had lunch with him the other day.

234
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,910
He's one of these guys
that anything goes wrong...

235
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,354
...he blames anti-Semitism.

236
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,597
Know what I mean? The spaghetti's
not al dente? Cook, anti-Semite.

237
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,637
- Right there, yeah.
- Loses a bet on a horse?

238
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,349
- Secretariat, anti-Semitic.
- Even the horse... Even the animal.

239
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,829
The High Holy Days in the temple?
Rabbi, anti-Semite.

240
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,590
Listen to this. My Uncle Leo broke up
with his girlfriend because of my bit.

241
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,638
She thought it was funny, so he
accused her of being an anti-Semite.

242
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,189
They had a fight, now he's
moving back to his apartment.

243
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,828
Know what this means? My parents
are gonna go back to Florida.

244
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,353
What?

245
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,351
What number is this?

246
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,470
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

247
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,596
Kramer, my parents are gonna have to
move back to Florida. Isn't that great?

248
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,558
Yeah, well, I'm really happy for you.

249
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,790
Hey, you're not giving it to me, man.
What's wrong?

250
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,873
I just took a bath, Jerry. A bath.

251
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,993
- No good?
- It's disgusting.

252
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,914
I'm sitting there in a tepid pool
of my own filth.

253
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,596
All kinds of microscopic parasites
and organisms...

254
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,990
...having sex all around me.

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,877
Well, you used to sit
in that hot tub.

256
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,868
Jerry, that was super-heated water.
Nothing could live in that.

257
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,514
- Chicken?
- Oh, yeah.

258
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,038
Well, this you're not gonna believe.

259
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,879
I found out why
I was testing positive for opium.

260
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,349
- Poppy seeds.
- Poppy seeds.

261
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,391
- Yep, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

262
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,391
- Here you want some chicken?
- Yeah, thanks.

263
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,319
So I'm gonna get tested again later.

264
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,871
Hopefully I'll get my job back,
and I will be on my way to Africa.

265
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,676
Hello, Newman.

266
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:08,598
Hello, Jerry. Well, I may have
a solution to our little problem.

267
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,470
- Elaine, will you excuse us?
- Oh, come on, Newman.

268
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,114
I have a private matter to discuss
with my fellow tenants.

269
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,759
If you don't mind...

270
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,712
- Jerry...
- Look, sister, go get yourself...

271
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,871
...a cup of coffee, all right? Beat it.

272
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,793
All right. Now, here's the lowdown.
Through a certain connection...

273
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,520
...l've been able to locate
some black-market showerheads.

274
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,836
They're all made
in the former Yugoslavia.

275
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,032
And from what I hear, the Serbs
are fanatic about their showers.

276
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,435
Not from the footage I've seen.

277
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,719
Nevertheless,
sometime this afternoon...

278
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,952
...behind the market diner,
an unmarked van will be waiting.

279
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,680
I'm expecting the call at any time.

280
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,115
- Are you in?
- I'm down.

281
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,793
Jerry?

282
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,232
So, Georgie,
we have some big news for you.

283
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,233
- Big news?
- We're moving to Florida.

284
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,313
What?

285
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,909
You're moving to Florida?

286
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,470
That's wonderful. I'm so happy!

287
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,995
For you! I'm so happy for you!

288
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,549
Oh, what do you need
this cold weather for?

289
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,034
Has nothing to do with weather.

290
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,236
- It's because of the Seinfelds.
- What do you mean?

291
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,954
They don't want us there,
so we're going.

292
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,356
We're moving right into
Del Boca Vista!

293
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,630
- So you're moving there for spite.
- Absolutely.

294
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,599
No one tells Frank Costanza
what to do!

295
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,190
That's right! Who the hell are they?
How dare they?

296
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,279
So, Georgie, are you gonna
come to visit us?

297
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,433
Oh, every chance I get.

298
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,119
Jerry, Jerry!
I'm busting, I'm busting!

299
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,959
- Well, what's going on?
- My parents are moving to Florida!

300
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,674
- Are you kidding?
- Can you believe it? It's happening!

301
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,229
It's finally happening, I'm free!

302
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,113
- Well, where are they moving to?
- Del Boca Vista.

303
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,958
That's where my parents
are gonna live.

304
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,752
- I know.
- We can visit together.

305
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,234
Every five years!

306
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,392
- That's incredible.
- You know why they're moving there?

307
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,278
- Why?
- To spite your parents.

308
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,714
- To spite my parents?
- Yeah.

309
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,440
- Your parents are crazy.
- I know, they're out of their mind.

310
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,993
- I don't believe it.
- Fantastic.

311
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,316
- My parents are moving back too.
- Beautiful!

312
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,234
I'm sorry Leo's moving back here.
I'm not ready to go back to Florida.

313
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,433
He was getting along so well
with that woman. What happened?

314
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,074
Hello?

315
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,710
- This is Frank Costanza.
- What do you want?

316
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,599
You think you can k eep us
out of Florida?

317
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,156
We're moving in
lock, stock and barrel.

318
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,038
We're gonna be in the pool.

319
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,031
We're gonna be in the clubhouse.

320
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,919
We're gonna be all over
that shuffleboard court...

321
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,629
...and I dare you to keep me out!

322
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,755
I'm sorry, we can't go back
to Florida.

323
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,557
I can't believe
I didn't push for this sooner.

324
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,672
You have no idea how your life
is gonna improve as a result of this.

325
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,398
Food tastes better.

326
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,596
The air seems fresher.
You'll have more energy...

327
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,479
...and self-confidence
than you ever dreamed of.

328
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,037
- Hello.
- Hello, Jerry, it's your father.

329
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,593
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Is it all right...

330
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,399
...if we move in with you
for a little while?

331
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,670
- What was that?
- Nothing. A bottle broke, that's all.

332
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,796
What do you mean,
you're gonna move in here?

333
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,468
Because the Costanzas
are moving in to Del Boca Vista.

334
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,240
- But it's a big complex.
- You don't understand.

335
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,635
You gotta have a buffer zone.

336
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,311
All right, fine. Come over here.

337
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,473
What?

338
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,200
They're not going back to Florida.

339
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,476
- They're moving here.
- What? Why?

340
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,910
Because your parents
are going down there.

341
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,470
My buffer zone just went from
1200 miles down to two feet.

342
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,629
You gotta do something.

343
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,749
Hey, I'm sorry. You had
your buffer zone for many years.

344
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,309
It's my time to live, baby.

345
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,632
You know what you're doing,
don't you?

346
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,358
You're killing independent Jerry.

347
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,309
I gotta go see my Uncle Leo.

348
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,119
I think he may have made
a big mistake.

349
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,757
- Move back with Lydia?
- Come on.

350
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,512
You're lucky to have anybody.

351
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,631
Last week you told me I was
in my prime. I should be swinging.

352
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,308
Swinging?
What, are you out of your mind?

353
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,198
Look at you. You're disgusting.

354
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,514
You're bald. You're paunchy.

355
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,917
All kinds of sounds are emanating
from your body 24 hours a day.

356
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,835
If there's a woman that can take your
presence for more than 10 seconds...

357
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,070
...you should hang on to her
like grim death.

358
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,549
Which is not far off, by the way.

359
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,309
- But she's an anti-Semite.
- Can you blame her?

360
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,675
You don't think he minds
us staying here, do you?

361
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,633
Why would he mind?
We're his parents.

362
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,838
- Hi, Elaine.
- Hello.

363
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,959
- Jerry's not here?
- No.

364
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,357
- Oh, my God.
- What?

365
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,636
A poppy seed.

366
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,950
It must have been in the chicken.

367
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,872
Oh, I'm dead.

368
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,996
I'm going to the doctor's
in a half an hour.

369
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,475
- Why?
- It's a long story.

370
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,750
Just a second.
I have to go to the bathroom.

371
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,750
Wait. What are you gonna do
in there?

372
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,399
What am I gonna do
in the bathroom?

373
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,595
You gotta do me a favour.

374
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,554
- Elaine, I really have...
- Hold on a second, Mrs. Seinfeld.

375
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,955
I need your sample.

376
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,519
You want my urine?

377
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,836
I need a clean urine sample
from a woman.

378
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,713
- I don't know.
- Oh, please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?

379
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,512
Well, what am I gonna do it in?

380
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,518
- Well, one of those glasses.
- Jerry's glasses?

381
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,759
Oh, yeah. He won't mind.
Come on, you're his mom.

382
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,514
I could... Should I use a coffee cup?

383
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,353
- Yeah, coffee cup's fine.
- Or maybe I could use a juice glass.

384
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,636
Yes, yes. Fine, fine.
A juice glass. It's perfect.

385
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,115
- This one is kind of scratched.
- It doesn't matter.

386
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,352
- All right. How...? A milk glass.
- A milk glass, a juice glass.

387
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,353
- Any glass, just pick a glass.
- Jerry really doesn't...

388
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,398
...wash these very well.
- Mrs. Seinfeld, choose a glass.

389
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,955
Pick a glass, Mrs. Seinfeld.

390
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,992
All right. I got everything here.

391
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,957
I got the Cyclone F series...

392
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,118
...Hydra Jet Flow, Stockholm
Superstream, you name it.

393
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,719
What do you recommend?

394
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,275
- What are you looking for?
- Power, man, power.

395
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,714
Like Silkwood.

396
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,758
- That's for radiation.
- That's right.

397
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,791
Now, what is this?

398
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,991
That's the Commando 450.
I don't sell that one.

399
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,952
No, that's what we want,
the Commando 450.

400
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,754
No, believe me. That's only used
in the circus for elephants.

401
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,757
- Just give it to us.
- We'll pay anything.

402
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,036
- Give me the money.
- We've got the...

403
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,714
- What about Jerry?
- He couldn't handle that.

404
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,154
He's delicate.

405
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,432
It's nice being back at Leo's.
Jerry's place was too small.

406
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,392
First Leo breaks up,
then he goes back.

407
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,551
What the hell's going on?

408
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,711
- Who is it?
- It's the super.

409
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,998
We're installing new low-flow
showerheads in all the bathrooms.

410
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,559
Low-flow?

411
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,836
I don't like the sound of that.

412
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,837
So as a result of your test
being free of opium...

413
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,276
...I am reinstating you.
- Oh, yes!

414
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,396
What a load off.

415
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,795
So when are we going to Africa?

416
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,518
I'm afraid I can't take you.

417
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,073
What? Why not?

418
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,277
Elaine, according to your
urine analysis, you're menopausal.

419
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,349
You have the metabolism
of a 68-year-old woman.

420
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,193
But I wanted to see the Bushmen.

421
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,312
Oh, and one more thing.

422
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,879
You may have osteoporosis.

423
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,355
- Well, it's been a great visit.
- Jerry, I'll tell you.

424
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,557
First thing I'm gonna do when
I get back to Florida is take a shower.

425
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,115
At least the Costanzas
changed their mind about moving.

426
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,471
- They couldn't bear leaving George.
- George must be happy about that.

427
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,911
You have no idea.

428
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,790
Take my swim trunks.
I won't need them.

429
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,594
What does he want
with your swim trunks?

430
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,552
Why should they go to waste?

431
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,477
Oh, yeah.
