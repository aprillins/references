1
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:07,505
Give me an explanation
why the pharmacist has to be...

2
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:11,075
...two and a half feet up
above everybody else.

3
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:15,210
What the hell is he doing he can't be
on the floor with you and me?

4
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:19,250
Brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear
physicists, we're on the same level.

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,782
Oh, no, he's gotta be
two and a half feet up.

6
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:26,448
"Look out, everybody,
I'm working with pills.

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,785
Spread out, give me some room."

8
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,059
The only hard part of his whole job
that I could see...

9
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:35,098
...is typing everything
onto that little, tiny label.

10
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:38,297
And has to try and get
all the words on there...

11
00:00:38,471 --> 00:00:42,032
...keep the little piece of paper
in the roller of the typewriter.

12
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,302
Oh, no. He's gotta be
two and a half feet up.

13
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:49,744
"Yeah, I'd like to get this
prescription filled."

14
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:53,408
"All right. You wait down there.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,381
Only I'm allowed up here."

16
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:04,259
-Where'd you meet her?
-I met her on an elevator.

17
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:07,264
On an elevator?
You met a woman on an elevator?

18
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:10,301
-lmpossible, right?
-You got less than 60 seconds.

19
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,938
That's like dismantling a time bomb.

20
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,069
-What got into you?
-I don't know. She was so beautiful...

21
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,039
...it was a pure reflex. The words...

22
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,146
-...just came out of my mouth.
-Wow. What did you say?

23
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:26,645
You know, I'm the one responsible
for those crop circles in England.

24
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,420
-Can you believe I did that?
-What did she say?

25
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,684
What crop circles?

26
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:37,894
-Not a good sign.
-Not everybody knows...

27
00:01:38,064 --> 00:01:41,192
...what the crop circles are.
You know what the crop circles are?

28
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:43,494
Crop circles?
Why don't you buy something?

29
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,494
You got something in your teeth.

30
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:47,769
-What?
-It's green.

31
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:52,105
Oh, man, spinach. I've been
walking around like this all afternoon.

32
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:56,078
-You bump into anybody you knew?
-I had a job interview.

33
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,883
-How did it go?
-Take a guess.

34
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,215
Well, Mr. Costanza, we have nothing
available at the present time...

35
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,652
...but should anything open up,
we'll be in touch.

36
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:06,956
Okay, thanks.

37
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,857
You don't need a job.
You got Audrey.

38
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,860
Yeah. Right.

39
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,623
-What's the matter?
-No. Nothing.

40
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,496
-What?
-You won't think I'm a bad person?

41
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,361
Too late for that.

42
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:23,475
Because, believe me, I would only say
this to you and maybe a psychiatrist.

43
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,435
What is it?

44
00:02:25,612 --> 00:02:27,102
Well....

45
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,646
Her nose is a little big.

46
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,717
Yeah, she's got a big nose.

47
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,356
I mean, big would even be okay.

48
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:39,186
It's beyond big.

49
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:42,558
It's a schnoz.

50
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,387
I'm aware that my own
physical dimensions...

51
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,329
-...are a little short of perfection.
-A little.

52
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,833
Who am I to be thinking
about someone's nose?

53
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:55,236
I should be grateful someone like her
looks at me. I have no job, nothing.

54
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,807
But I have to say,
I think about the nose.

55
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:02,075
I don't wanna think about it, I don't ask
to think about it, but I think about it.

56
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:06,378
I go to bed, I tell myself, "Don't
think about the nose." I think about it.

57
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:09,612
I look at her, I see the nose.

58
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:13,025
Stop being so concerned with looks.

59
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,597
-Have you said anything to her?
-No. Could never do that.

60
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,898
The ironic thing is,
if she had a smaller nose...

61
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:31,339
...I never could've dated her. She'd be
out of my league with a smaller nose.

62
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:35,039
And I really like her. I know that.

63
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,240
And I know one other thing:

64
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,877
I'm not getting past that nose.

65
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,216
All right, shut up. Here they come.

66
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:46,552
How can I not think about it?
Look at the size of this thing.

67
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:52,727
My mother's going out with this guy
who leaves a jacket in her house.

68
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:57,199
She gives to me. Well, two years later,
he shows up and takes it back.

69
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,233
Now he's in prison.
Got arrested for mail fraud.

70
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:06,407
So, Elaine, go over to the apartment,
tell the landlord you're his daughter...

71
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,410
...and you wanna bring him
the jacket.

72
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,175
Won't the landlord know
I'm not the daughter?

73
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,842
No, he's never met her.
She's in California.

74
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:18,480
-Are you coming with me?
-Yeah, I have to. I'm your fiance.

75
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,621
Peter Von Nostrand.

76
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,922
Why don't you just
commit yourself already?

77
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,927
What is so special
about this jacket?

78
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,399
-No, you don't wanna know.
-God....

79
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,700
He believes it possesses some
extraordinary power over women.

80
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,671
What's that splotch on your hand?

81
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,812
I got stamped at the
reggae lounge last night.

82
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,437
I'm going back there tonight. I'm not
gonna pay another cover charge.

83
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,282
You didn't wash all day?

84
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,782
Yeah, I washed. Just not the hand.

85
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:54,593
You wouldn't believe the women
at this club. Man.

86
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,728
It's amazing how many
beautiful women live in New York.

87
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,864
I actually find it kind of intimidating.

88
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,900
You're as pretty as any of them.
Just need a nose job.

89
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,205
-Kramer!
-What? What?

90
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,539
How could you say
something like that?

91
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,080
What do you mean?
I just said she needs a nose job.

92
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,151
No, no. There's nothing wrong
with her nose.

93
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,153
-God, I'm so sorry, Audrey.
-Oh, it's okay.

94
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,724
-What did you have to say that for?
-I was just trying to help out.

95
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:31,893
Yeah, well, you can kiss that jacket
goodbye, Mr. Von Nausen.

96
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:35,993
You see what happens
when you try to be nice?

97
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,696
But what would the world be like...

98
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,136
...if people said whatever
they were thinking...

99
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,073
...all the time,
whenever it came to them?

100
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,608
How long would a blind date last?

101
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,772
About 13 seconds, I think.

102
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,051
"Sorry, your rear end is too big."
"Okay, your breath stinks."

103
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,314
"See you later. No problem. Goodbye."
"Okay, thank you very much."

104
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,926
Elaine said I can stay with her
another month till Tina gets back.

105
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:03,418
What are you thinking about?

106
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,161
Thinking? Nothing.

107
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,596
What could I possibly be thinking?

108
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,561
You look like you've got something
on your mind.

109
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:15,799
Yeah, right. I wish I had
something on my mind.

110
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,313
So how about that Kramer?

111
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,941
Yeah, how about him?

112
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,918
-The way he just says stuff.
-He sure does.

113
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,953
Yeah, yeah.

114
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,917
Yeah, he's quite a character.

115
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,122
So, what did you think?

116
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,929
About the pizza?

117
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,931
No. About the nose job.

118
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:45,867
Oh, the nose job. Yeah....

119
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:47,639
I don't know. I--

120
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:52,142
-Well, what did you think?
-Well, I've thought about it...

121
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,176
-...but I don't know.
-Yeah.

122
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,481
You know, not that I care
one way or the other...

123
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,521
...but these doctors today do amazing
things. If you were so inclined.

124
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:09,320
-And again, I'm not suggesting.
-I know. They're good.

125
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,156
Peter Jennings had one.

126
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,491
-Really?
-Probably. They all do.

127
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,726
In my high school,
half my graduating class had them.

128
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,269
Of course,
I'm from Long lsland, so....

129
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,674
It's really nothing.
It's like going to the dentist.

130
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,779
-I hate the dentist.
-It's a cleaning.

131
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,346
So you really think I should do this.

132
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:38,182
If it makes you happy.
I don't focus on these things.

133
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,823
I will tell you this, though.

134
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,088
Unfortunately...

135
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,960
...we live in a very
superficial society.

136
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,963
I don't condone it...

137
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,366
...but it's a fact of life.

138
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:56,674
Well, maybe I should.

139
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,407
-What the hell?
-Now you talked her into a nose job?

140
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,708
-Me? I didn't say anything.
-You encouraged her to get one.

141
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:06,716
-I didn't encourage. No encourage.
-"Peter Jennings had one"?

142
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,715
It's possible.

143
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:12,513
-You should accept her for who she is.
-No, George is right.

144
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,092
-I wanna get one.
-I think it's a mistake.

145
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,922
Me too. Really.

146
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,398
Unless you'd really like one, then....

147
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,636
I'm going straight to hell.

148
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,101
No two ways about it.

149
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:31,038
It might not be hell,
but you're gonna run into bad dudes.

150
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,746
Get the check.
She takes the bandages off at 4:00.

151
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:37,576
We have time.

152
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,711
It's exciting.
She's gonna have a new face.

153
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,917
-lt is exciting.
-Not as exciting as Miss Crop Circles.

154
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,592
Please, please. Isabel?

155
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:52,128
She is the most despicable woman
I have ever met in my life.

156
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,098
I have never been so repulsed
by someone mentally...

157
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,932
...and so attracted to them physically
at the same time.

158
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,769
It's like my brain is facing my penis
in a chess game.

159
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:10,309
And I'm letting him win.

160
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,446
You're not letting him win.
He wins till you're 40.

161
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:17,214
-Then what?
-He still wins, but it's not a blowout.

162
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:20,982
She wants to be an actress.

163
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,062
She makes me read these moronic
acting scenes with her, and I do it.

164
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:30,130
Because I'm so addicted to the sex,
I'm helpless. I'll do anything.

165
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,667
So, finally, Kramer comes in
the other day.

166
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:35,232
I don't want to see this woman
anymore...

167
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,002
...but I haven't got the willpower
to throw out her number.

168
00:09:38,177 --> 00:09:39,872
Please help me.

169
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,179
Help me.

170
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,348
I'm proud of you.

171
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:53,856
So I'm never gonna see her again.
I'm going cold turkey.

172
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,391
Good for you.

173
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:59,490
I'll tell you, the sex....

174
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,492
I was like an animal.

175
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,830
I mean, it was just
completely uninhibited.

176
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:11,368
It's like going to the bathroom in front
of a lot of people, and not caring.

177
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,006
It's not like that at all.

178
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,647
How do you even know
the jacket is there?

179
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,889
Well, I don't. I'm guessing.

180
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,529
Okay, look, Audrey,
before you take the bandage off...

181
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,932
...just remember, I was the one
that encouraged you to do this.

182
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,967
Now that you're gonna be a great
beauty, let's not forget how this began.

183
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,503
-lf you listened to your friend Elaine--
-George.

184
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,273
-Yeah?
-Enough.

185
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:43,908
-Right, enough.
-Are we ready?

186
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,941
Come on,
let's get this show on the road.

187
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:48,636
-You sure you want us here for this?
-Yes.

188
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,417
-Shouldn't a doctor do it?
-No, he said I could do it.

189
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:54,382
Okay, here goes.

190
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:58,216
This is very exciting. Very exciting.
It's like watching a birth.

191
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,892
It looks good.

192
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,491
-Great job.
-You got butchered.

193
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,934
Head hurt.
No, I'm good. I'm fine.

194
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,145
Let's put him over here.

195
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:23,408
-Where are you going?
-To that doctor.

196
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:25,549
Wait, wait, wait! I'll go with you.

197
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:37,259
How you feeling?

198
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:40,993
Too much salt in my diet.

199
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,268
-Can I get you anything?
-I'm good.

200
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,102
You sure? Anything.

201
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,731
No.

202
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,838
Boy, it really didn't come out
too well, did it?

203
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,574
No, it didn't. No, it didn't.

204
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,188
It's, like, all dented.

205
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,587
Seems to be.

206
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,354
Well, I'm sure
they'll be able to fix it.

207
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:16,500
You can't stop modern science.
Can't stop it. Can't stop science.

208
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,661
Can't be stopped. No way, no how.
Science just marches--

209
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,864
Shut up, George.

210
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,273
-Shut up?
-Yeah.

211
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:30,074
Interesting.

212
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,144
Come on, Kramer.
Seriously, give me her number!

213
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,913
-I threw it out.
-You're lying.

214
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,353
-You've got it. I want the number.
-I threw it out.

215
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,617
-Give it to me.
-You said not to.

216
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,490
-You made me promise.
-I changed my mind. I want it.

217
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,631
You said no matter what,
I'm not to give it to you.

218
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,960
-I was lying. Give it to me.
-You told me not to.

219
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:52,070
-I want the number!
-All right! You want it? Yeah!

220
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:55,668
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah.
Yeah, look at you.

221
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,966
Look at what you've sunk to.

222
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,509
Look at what you've become.

223
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:02,838
Look in the mirror, because you
need help, Jerry. You need help.

224
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:07,217
Because I can't stand by and do it
anymore. It's turning my stomach.

225
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:10,822
I can't stand around here
watching you destroy yourself!

226
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,356
It's eating me up inside!

227
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:30,069
The doctor said they need to build the
lateral wall of the septum. Over here.

228
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,538
Yeah.

229
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,508
-You see this paranasal sinus cavity?
-Oh, I got it.

230
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,242
See how it's collapsed?
That's what's causing this huge dent.

231
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,784
Yeah. Rough, rough.

232
00:13:43,088 --> 00:13:45,181
So anyway, you know what
I was thinking about?

233
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,020
What?

234
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:50,060
Remember we talked
about taking a trip together?

235
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:54,528
-We did?
-We talked about going to Hawaii.

236
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,194
-Hawaii?
-Anyway, I think it would be great...

237
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,963
...to get away after all this.

238
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,073
Well, you--

239
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,778
You know, Hawaii could be
a little tricky now.

240
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:09,744
There's high-pressure winds
down there this time of year.

241
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,043
There's a lot of debris
constantly flying around, a lot of...

242
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:15,346
...wood and lava.

243
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,279
It could be dangerous.

244
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:21,050
-I never heard that.
-Oh, yeah. My friend lived there, so....

245
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,953
We could go to the Caribbean.

246
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,022
I have to tell you something.
You couldn't get me on a plane now.

247
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,302
I get those FAA reports directly.

248
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,471
My uncle sends them to me.
He used to be a pilot, so....

249
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,769
Big investigation in the....

250
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:41,037
What's the word there?
Offing. It's in the offing.

251
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:46,943
But you shouldn't let that stop you
from going. You could go. I don't mind.

252
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,855
-George?
-Yeah.

253
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:52,350
I don't think this is working.

254
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:58,590
Ever since you came back from
the Army, you've changed.

255
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:04,165
I swear, Nelson, I don't even know
who you are anymore.

256
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,462
I'm Nelson.

257
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,503
-That's not the line, Jerry.
-All right, all right, I'm sorry.

258
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:17,009
Nothing's changed, Elma.
I just need more time.

259
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:22,951
I swear, Nelson, sometimes at
night when you're not around...

260
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,317
...I just go crazy thinking
about you.

261
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,284
Well, you just need to relax.

262
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,859
Maybe a hobby. Bowling is fun.

263
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:37,663
Yeah, bowling's good,
if you're really gross and ugly.

264
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,838
Uh-oh. My organs
are playing chess again.

265
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:44,999
I'm getting tired of this. What do you
say we play one for all the marbles?

266
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:48,704
Oh, brain, what are you doing?
You cannot beat me.

267
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:52,373
Do you have any idea who you're
dealing with? Forget about it.

268
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,041
I can't take her anymore.

269
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:57,882
-I hate reading her little acting scenes.
-Oh, so what?

270
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,820
So you read from a little play.

271
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,484
You can't put up with that for an hour
to make me happy? You're so selfish.

272
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,323
Give me one hour.

273
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,699
Then I will take over. You won't
have to think for the rest of the night.

274
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,300
What about tomorrow morning?

275
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,030
Do you have any idea what
that's like for me? Do you care?

276
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:15,696
No, you don't care.

277
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:19,469
So long as you get to do
whatever it is you do.

278
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,170
-You disgust me.
-Oh, go read a book.

279
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:25,340
Enough chatter. Let's play.

280
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:29,187
I'm only doing this because
you took Audrey to the hospital.

281
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,754
Yeah. Yeah. Okay, now, you're clear?
You got everything?

282
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,483
-Yeah.
-Wait, wait, wait.

283
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:37,425
Here.

284
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:41,230
-What do I need this for?
-Because we're engaged.

285
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,061
We're engaged?

286
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,199
Kramer, this is too big.

287
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:50,038
-It's my mom's.
-Hello!

288
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:54,669
Oh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper.
I'm Albert Pepper's daughter.

289
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,441
My father asked me to pick up
his jacket for him.

290
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,948
Hello, Miss Pepper.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

291
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,517
And you must be
Professor Von Nostrand.

292
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,950
Yes. Yes, I am.

293
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:08,386
I've read your book, professor,
and I was quite intrigued by it.

294
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:11,863
-Yes, well, it's very intriguing.
-Tell me...

295
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,296
...is it your contention that
Shakespeare was an imposter?

296
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:16,934
-My contention?
-Your contention.

297
00:17:17,102 --> 00:17:20,230
-Well, yes, that's my contention.
-I heard him contend that.

298
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,506
It's too bad about your father.

299
00:17:22,674 --> 00:17:26,405
-lt was a frame-up.
-A fine man. He spoke often of you.

300
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,910
He's very proud of the work
you're doing.

301
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:33,080
-We're all proud of the work I'm doing.
-Yes, she does fine work.

302
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:37,779
Your father gave me strict orders
not to turn the jacket over to anyone...

303
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,618
...but I suppose I can make
an exception in your case.

304
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,954
-The closet's this way.
-How kind of you.

305
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:46,289
You know, your father has a very
extensive wardrobe.

306
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,126
Yes.

307
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:54,995
What's the matter, fella?
You look a little tired.

308
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:57,999
Nelson, don't you see?

309
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:01,742
You are a part of me.

310
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,244
And l....

311
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:07,477
I am a part of you.

312
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,686
She's killing me.

313
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,661
That's your move?

314
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,594
-Yeah.
-Well, that's trouble, my friend.

315
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,597
That's big trouble.

316
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,300
Checkmate.

317
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,667
Getting weak. Losing power.

318
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,708
You haven't seen the last of me.
I'll be back.

319
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,979
You're nothing without me.
Nothing.

320
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:41,882
Little punk.

321
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,789
Isabel, I don't think this is working.

322
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,628
Daddy certainly does have
an extensive wardrobe.

323
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,703
He is a fine dresser. I don't have to tell
you he's quite popular with the ladies.

324
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,430
My father? Really? I had no idea.

325
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:04,906
They're crazy about him.

326
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:08,535
One in particular came around
about two years ago.

327
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,981
Looked a lot like you, professor.
Could have been your mother.

328
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,648
What was her name again?

329
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,418
Carter? Kramer. That's it.

330
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,920
Babs Kramer. Nasty woman.

331
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,323
Many a night I had to
throw her on the street...

332
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,986
-...drunken stumblebum.
-You don't say.

333
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:29,532
-I found it!
-She walked around here half-naked...

334
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:33,000
...sucking Colt 45 from a can.

335
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:37,233
Her big, fat stomach hanging out,
orthopedic hose up to her knees...

336
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:39,206
...screaming down the hall:

337
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,245
"Come back to bed, Albert,
you big hairy ape!

338
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:46,180
And bring back that box of Danish!"

339
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:50,449
-So I grabbed the guy by the collar.
-Yeah, and I yelled out:

340
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,056
"Kramer, Kramer, you're killing him."

341
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,253
-So I assume the jig was up.
-Yeah, pretty much.

342
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:58,191
But look.

343
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,020
Yes.

344
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,201
-Hi. Here are your keys.
-Hi. Thank you.

345
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,360
-Hello.
-Audrey.

346
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:10,701
My God, you look incredible.
I can't believe it.

347
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:14,571
Well, it was his doctor.
He was wonderful.

348
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,711
So will I see you later tonight?

349
00:20:17,249 --> 00:20:19,308
Not sure.

350
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,881
Well, I'll check you guys out later.

351
00:20:24,656 --> 00:20:26,556
-Ready?
-I didn't wash.

352
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,659
Neither did l.

353
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,662
We're off to the reggae lounge.

354
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:42,737
My nose, my nose.
My kingdom for a nose.

355
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:47,869
Isn't she beautiful? Her nose
is in such perfect proportions...

356
00:20:48,046 --> 00:20:50,674
...to the rest of her face.
She's breathtaking.

357
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,317
-Who would have thought, she's--?
-Elaine...

358
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,512
...shut up.

359
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,056
The technical term
for a nose job is...?

360
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,285
-Rhinoplasty.
-Rhinoplasty.

361
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,260
Rhino. Okay?

362
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:13,327
Do we really need to insult the person
at this moment of their lives?

363
00:21:13,505 --> 00:21:16,565
They know they have a big nose.
That's why they're coming in.

364
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:20,234
Do they really need the abuse
of being compared to a rhinoceros...

365
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,606
...on top of everything else?

366
00:21:22,981 --> 00:21:25,313
When someone has a
hair transplant, they don't go:

367
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:28,851
"We're going to perform a
cue ball-ectomy on you, Mr. Johnson.

368
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:33,318
We're going to attempt to remove
the skinheadia...

369
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,893
...of your chromedomus,
which is what we--

370
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,587
The technical term...."
