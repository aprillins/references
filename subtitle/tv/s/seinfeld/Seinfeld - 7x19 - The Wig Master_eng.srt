1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,992
I was thinking about the wig
historically.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,875
The Revolutionary War
was the last war fought in wigs...

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,237
...and it seems like that must have
been hard. They're going into battle:

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,994
"Well, do I have my bullets?
Do I have my bobby pins?"

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,958
You gotta make sure you have
everything. Lot more to worry about.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,078
"What if I get killed?
Is my wig on straight?"

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,077
I don't know when the whole wig thing
came into style for a man...

8
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,673
...but I know when it went out:

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,434
When the mirror was invented.

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,158
No guy is looking in a mirror...

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,278
...powdering a thatch of horsehair
on his head, going:

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,274
"All right, let's go
rap to the ladies."

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,958
- I'm looking for a crested blazer.
- A crested blazer.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,476
I wore one once, and I really think
it did something for me.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,392
Yes, I think we might
have something.

16
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,873
The Joseph Abboud crested blazer
is the finest.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,474
That's hand ticking
around the crest...

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,110
...and these are the world-famous
corisso buttons...

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,032
...made from
the finest antelope horn.

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,310
Then they'll match my sneakers.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,278
It looks fabulous on you.
Shall I wrap it up?

22
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,113
You know, I'm not sure.

23
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,759
I'll tell you what.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,798
I'll come back later with someone,
see what they think.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,997
- Really, I'll be back.
- Yeah.

26
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,230
So I didn't like the crest all that much,
but the guy spent 15 minutes with me.

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,756
To get out of the store, I said I wanted
to see what someone else thought.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,195
Then he makes a face
like he doesn't believe me.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,952
So he knew
you were making it up?

30
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,155
Yeah, he caught me.

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,199
So here's what I want you to do.

32
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,193
Come with me to the store,
and we'll pretend to look at the coat.

33
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,828
That's ridiculous.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,911
Why go back there
if you don't want the coat?

35
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,676
Because he thinks I was lying.
I wanna show him I wasn't.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,194
But you were.

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,318
But if you go back with me,
then I'm not.

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,717
All right, fine. Whatever.

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,198
Problems with the houseguest?

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,554
What houseguest?

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,473
This friend of Susan's
is staying with us for two weeks.

42
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,551
Now, am I wrong,
or is that excessive?

43
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,194
Well, Bob Sacamano, he stayed
with me once for a year and a half.

44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,075
- Who is he?
- He's a wig master.

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,719
- What is a wig master?
- He's with the touring company...

46
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,474
...of Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat.

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,278
He's the guy in charge of the wigs.

48
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,397
Boy, imagine liking wigs to the point
it becomes a career choice.

49
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,313
So how about some tickets, George?
You know, I'd kill for a peek.

50
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,438
Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.
I gotta drop my car off at the new lot.

51
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,955
- What lot's that?
- Jiffy Park. It's incredible.

52
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,439
Seventy-five dollars a month.

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,158
Seventy-five bucks a month?

54
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,117
You get this cool T-shirt
when you sign up.

55
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,349
Oh, I'm down.

56
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,752
Remember me? I said I'd come back
with someone, and I did.

57
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,750
- Surprised?
- No, I believed you.

58
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,552
This is Elaine.

59
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,188
Oh, hello. I'm Craig.

60
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,793
Oh, hi.

61
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,676
Well, here it is.

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,676
Joseph Abboud.

63
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,593
And look at this hand ticking
around the crest.

64
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,193
You know your clothes.

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,636
Well, I'm in the biz.
I work for J. Peterman.

66
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,156
I love J. Peterman.
I especially enjoy the catalog.

67
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,436
Those fanciful narratives
really take me away.

68
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,749
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

69
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,399
- You know what? I write those.
- No.

70
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,632
Elaine, what about the crest?
What do you think of the crest here?

71
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,392
Well, I love it.

72
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,073
- You what?
- I think it's great.

73
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,993
- I think you should get it.
- Well...

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,317
- Will it be check or credit card?
- Check.

75
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,952
I'll need you to write down your
phone number on the check for me.

76
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,758
Perhaps you could do the same.

77
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,279
You weren't supposed to say that.

78
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,635
- But I really did like it.
- That's not the point.

79
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,360
You put me in a position
where I had no choice.

80
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,555
Sorry.

81
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,354
What about that guy
asking you out right in front of me?

82
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,431
What is the big deal?

83
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,717
It was very emasculating. He doesn't
know the nature of our relationship.

84
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,111
You're there approving new clothes.
That's a girlfriend job.

85
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,474
How dare he?

86
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,551
He dared.

87
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,399
Hi, George. How was your day?

88
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,116
Good. Good day.

89
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,196
- You?
- I am getting so much work done.

90
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,397
- See?
- Very nice.

91
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,471
Hey, sweetie, how was your day?

92
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,870
I already asked him that.
He said, "Good. Good day."

93
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,958
Thank God you're home.
I'm locked out.

94
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,712
I dropped my car at Jiffy Park...

95
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,189
...and I forgot to take
my apartment key off the ring.

96
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,796
- So you got my spare?
- No, I gave it back to you.

97
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,109
You did?

98
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,589
Well, look,
can you take me over there?

99
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,159
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, come on, Jerry.

100
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,392
- It's all the way over to 12th Avenue.
- I didn't tell you to park there.

101
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,120
Now someone's gotta drive you
every time you need your car?

102
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,635
- Take the bus.
- I'm not gonna take the bus.

103
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,756
That's why I got a car.

104
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,749
- Forget it.
- I'm gonna get George to pick me up.

105
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,672
He won't take you.

106
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,480
Got it, got it. Hello?

107
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,153
Can you take me over to Jiffy Park?

108
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,915
Yeah, I'll pick you up right now.
All right. Okay. Gotta go.

109
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,718
So the wig mas...

110
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,474
The wig master said
you could stop by the theater tonight...

111
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,517
...and he'll show you around.

112
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,639
Would you pick a station!

113
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,189
I like them all.

114
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,189
Oh, great.

115
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,749
Now the volume knob fell off.

116
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,909
What's this?

117
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,389
- Oh, God.
- What?

118
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,039
It's a c...

119
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,475
It's a condom!

120
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,399
How do you like working there
at The Andover Shop?

121
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,791
I mean, it's pretty swanky.
Upscale clientele.

122
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,837
Except for Jerry.

123
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,831
So did you see anything you liked?

124
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,111
Because I can get you
a considerable discount.

125
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,516
Really? Well, actually,
yeah, I did see...

126
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,389
...this amazing little black dress.
It was sleeveless.

127
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,357
- The Nicole Miller.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

128
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,351
- I'll take care of it.
- Really?

129
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,714
But I barely know you.

130
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,032
Well, we'll just have to
do something about that, won't we?

131
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,071
- Hey, Greg.
- It's Craig.

132
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,037
Oh, right. Nice lunch with Elaine?

133
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,274
Yes, lovely.

134
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,398
You know, I'm just curious, how did
you know she wasn't my girlfriend?

135
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,949
Well, I could just sense it.

136
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,553
You know, we used to go out.

137
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,759
- Oh, you did?
- Oh, yeah, we went way out and wild.

138
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,029
- Hey, Jer.
- Hi, Elaine.

139
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,351
Would you like to buy a rose
for your wife?

140
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,269
How do you know
she's not my wife?

141
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,156
I wanna know,
how did that get into my car?

142
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,915
Hey, look, you walk in this city,
things are gonna stick to your foot.

143
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,594
You open your car and... condom.

144
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,030
That doesn't explain
the lipstick on the dashboard.

145
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,317
Here, take a few shirts.

146
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,511
- What?
- I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Kramer...

147
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,717
...but we can't get your car now.
The keys have been misplaced.

148
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,440
I need those keys. I won't be able
to get into my apartment.

149
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,956
Mr. Kramer, you like Cadillacs?

150
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,548
Yeah, I like Cadillacs.
Why, what do you got on your mind?

151
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,073
Take that pink Cadillac Eldorado
over there.

152
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,673
It's a Mary Kay car.

153
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,274
- Mary Kay?
- Mary Kay car.

154
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,317
I'll see you later.
Thanks for driving me.

155
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,789
Hey, what's happening?

156
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,996
I'm gonna hang around here
a little while.

157
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,912
Something funny going on here.

158
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,198
You were wrong about Craig.
He's a very sweet guy.

159
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,713
Well, what about the ponytail?

160
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,313
- What about it?
- Come on.

161
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,755
Ponytail? Get real.

162
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,397
All I know is he promised me
a discount on that dress.

163
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,278
Of course he did.
The guy's working you.

164
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,432
Oh, Jerry, I've been around enough
to know when I'm being worked.

165
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,275
- Have you slept with him yet?
- I just met him this morning.

166
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,354
It's been known to happen.

167
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,152
I'm telling you right now, Elaine...

168
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,675
...this guy's gonna dangle that dress
in front of you...

169
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,718
...like a dirt farmer
dangles a carrot in front of a mule.

170
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,072
Well, this is all very flattering...

171
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,357
- Like a shark fisherman with chum.
- Okay.

172
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,318
- Like a shrimp farmer...
- Okay.

173
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,711
Well, that's the grand tour...

174
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,189
...but I saved the best for last.
- Oh, yeah.

175
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,196
Behold, the Technicolor Dreamcoat.

176
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,838
Spectacular.

177
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,039
Excuse me. Would you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

178
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,348
Are you a cop?

179
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,717
Oh, no, no. No, I'm not a cop.
I work for the Yankees.

180
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,674
They stink.

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,438
Nevertheless, I was wondering
if you and your friends...

182
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,398
...are doing business
here at the Jiffy Park?

183
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,677
You know,
what do you people call it?

184
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,717
Turning tricks?

185
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,153
Anyway, see, the thing is,
I found a condom in my car.

186
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,833
Now, I'm not saying it's yours...

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,309
...I just wanna know
if I should change parking lots.

188
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,354
Get lost, mister.
I'm trying to make a living here.

189
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,159
I'll pay for your time.
I just need some information.

190
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,390
How much do you want?
Ten? Fifteen?

191
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,278
- You have change for 20?
- Fifteen?

192
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,759
- Well...
- George?

193
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,399
Hi, honey.

194
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,631
- I hope that you're telling me the truth.
- Of course I'm telling the truth.

195
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,756
Because I have to be able
to trust you.

196
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,832
If I can't trust you,
there's no way that this can work.

197
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,318
Really?

198
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,913
Yeah.

199
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,829
Well, then you really have
something to think about...

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,639
...because, you know,
if there's any doubt in your mind...

201
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,030
And it doesn't even have
to be a big doubt, you know.

202
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,838
Even a tiny doubt,
a dot of a doubt...

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,989
There's no doubt.

204
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,277
Because if there's any doubt at all,
I feel that we should cultivate it.

205
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,874
Cultivate it?

206
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,318
Yes, you know, deal with it.
We have to deal with the doubt, Susan.

207
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,550
The doubt must be dealt with.

208
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,359
I have no doubt, George. Do you?

209
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,391
No.

210
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,956
You know, I can't wait
to get that dress.

211
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,157
Yeah, it should arrive imminently.

212
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,548
Arrive?

213
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,393
- Yes, from Milan.
- But you said it was in the store.

214
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,074
No, no, no. We sold out.
We've had to order some more.

215
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,232
- But I thought Nicole Miller was ma...
- Well...

216
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,595
- lan.
- Hey, Craig.

217
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,079
Elaine, this is lan.

218
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,196
- Oh, hi, lan.
- lan.

219
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,191
- lan.
- lan.

220
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,590
He's a friend of mine from England.

221
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,113
So tell me, how are you doing?

222
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,510
Well, I'm working over
at The Andover Shop, actually.

223
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,999
You should come by.

224
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,798
I'll get you a great discount.

225
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,393
Maybe I will.

226
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,315
- Nice meeting you.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

227
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,914
- Cheerio.
- Bye, lan.

228
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,511
So you getting him a discount too?

229
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,591
Well, why so surprised?

230
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,318
No reason.

231
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,797
That clothing salesman had a lot of
nerve hitting on Elaine in front of me.

232
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,511
He stands to make a big commission
too, on that jacket with the crest...

233
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,432
...that nobody seems to like.

234
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,231
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna take that jacket back.

235
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,233
I'm putting this guy
right out of commission.

236
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,238
All right. I'm gonna turn in.

237
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,039
- Turn in?
- Yeah, I had a tough day.

238
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,268
It's only 9:00.

239
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,076
Yeah, well, you know,
I don't argue with the body, Jerry.

240
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,674
That's an argument you can't win.

241
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,273
I can't go to sleep at 9:00.

242
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,111
Well, you can
go to your room and read.

243
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,434
Hey, look, you know,
you're the one who's locked out.

244
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,909
I'm letting you stay here.
You're wearing my bathrobe.

245
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,274
You should adapt to me.

246
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,112
But I'm tired.

247
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,032
Why don't you go sleep
at Newman's?

248
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,872
Oh, he's got a girl up there.

249
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,510
This quilt is too thin.
I know I'm gonna get cold.

250
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,433
I don't even fit on this couch.

251
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,872
I don't even know if I'm gonna sleep.

252
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,234
Well, that's all I've got.

253
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,476
Well, can I sleep with you?

254
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,476
Well, you've got that big,
comfortable bed...

255
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,596
...and that nice, warm quilt.

256
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,877
Kramer, there's no way
you're sleeping with me.

257
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,439
- Why?
- Why?

258
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,751
- Yeah.
- Do I really have to explain why?

259
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,353
- Well, l...
- Hey.

260
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,909
- Hey.
- What's that?

261
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,148
Squire's walking stick.
I had to write about it for the catalog.

262
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,518
- You want it?
- Yeah.

263
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,477
You can have it.
I don't need it anymore.

264
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,200
Oh, mama.

265
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,352
Okay, so I am positive
you are wrong about Craig.

266
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,669
Yeah, why?

267
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,833
Because he told a man he'd give him
a discount too. A man, Jerry.

268
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,230
- So? Who is he?
- Some friend of his from England.

269
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,311
Don't you see?

270
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,517
- It's all a big scam.
- You're nuts.

271
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,558
Well, how do you know he's not
wondering the same thing about you?

272
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,396
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

273
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,109
Well, perhaps he thinks that
you're working him for the discount.

274
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,637
Shaking that little butt of yours
into big, big savings.

275
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,633
Then when you get it, you know,
you drop him like a hot potato.

276
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,915
Oh, please.

277
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,594
No, see, the two of you
need to work on trust.

278
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,113
And then, and only then...

279
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,511
...will there be a free exchange
of sex and discounts.

280
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,918
The cornerstones
of a healthy relationship.

281
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,039
And now, if you would excuse us...

282
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,756
...we need to get to bed.

283
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,352
Yeah.

284
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,193
This patio furniture's on sale.

285
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,998
Excuse me.
I think I made a big mistake.

286
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,152
- I'd like my deposit back, please.
- What's the problem?

287
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,153
You got hookers turning tricks
in my car. How's that for starters?

288
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,639
That is all hearsay.

289
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,948
All right, very good.
I'd like my car and deposit back.

290
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,869
- Can't do it.
- What do you mean?

291
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,679
If you read the agreement,
the deposit is nonrefundable.

292
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,832
Does it say anything
in the contract...

293
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,797
...about my car
being used as a whorehouse?

294
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,837
I don't remember reading
that clause either.

295
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,359
What can I tell you, buddy?
Take it up with Consumer Affairs.

296
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,273
All right, just give me my car
and let me get the hell out of here.

297
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,510
That's going to be a problem.

298
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,072
- Why?
- It's all the way in the back.

299
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,992
We can't get it out
for a couple of days.

300
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,592
What are you talking about?
I want my car.

301
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,910
We ask that you
please bear with us.

302
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,958
Bear with you?

303
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,473
This is a parking lot.

304
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,790
People are supposed
to be able to get their cars.

305
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,032
Ideally.

306
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,912
Excuse me,
I'd like to return this jacket.

307
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,672
Certainly. May I ask why?

308
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,112
For spite.

309
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,478
Spite?

310
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,757
That's right. I don't care for
the salesman that sold it to me.

311
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,753
I don't think you can
return an item for spite.

312
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,840
- What do you mean?
- lf there was some problem with it...

313
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,958
...if it were unsatisfactory in some way,
then we could do it for you.

314
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,749
But I'm afraid spite doesn't fit
any of our conditions for a refund.

315
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,480
I wanna return it. What's the difference
what the reason is?

316
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,348
Let me speak with the manager.
Excuse me.

317
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,919
Bob?

318
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,356
This gentleman...
Spite.

319
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,240
- What seems to be the problem?
- I wanna return this jacket.

320
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,437
She asked me why, I said, "For spite,"
and now she won't take it back.

321
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,110
That's true. We can't return an item
based purely on spite.

322
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,677
Well, so fine, then. Then I don't
want it. That's why I'm returning it.

323
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,877
Well, you already said spite, so...

324
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,757
- But I changed my mind.
- No, you said spite.

325
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,638
Too late.

326
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,998
- Nice hat.
- Get a calendar, honey. It's the '90s.

327
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,788
- Elaine.
- Oh, hey.

328
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,678
These are my friends,
Jerry and Elaine.

329
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,114
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you doing?

330
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,872
- I'm Charmaine.
- I'm Ethan.

331
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,077
Yeah, she's the costume designer,
and he's the wig master for the show.

332
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,515
- Oh, you're staying with George.
- Right, George.

333
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,477
I get the feeling
he doesn't want me there.

334
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,631
He doesn't even want himself there.

335
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,676
- Why don't you sit down and join us?
- All right.

336
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,592
I can't. I've gotta go meet a friend.

337
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,149
Well, what are we, dog meat?

338
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,390
Another champagne coolie, please.

339
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,677
- You have really beautiful hair.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks very much.

340
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,308
Ever thought of selling it?
It would make a brilliant wig.

341
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,358
- They make wigs out of human hair?
- And pay plenty for them.

342
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,431
Okay, well, you guys
are gonna have fun here.

343
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,511
- All right.
- See you later.

344
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,558
I just remembered, I gotta get
the Dreamcoat from the dry cleaner.

345
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,678
- You'll let me wear the other one?
- Yeah, but you have to be careful.

346
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,434
- It's my only backup.
- Who do you think you're talking to?

347
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,749
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye.

348
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,319
Bye.

349
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,910
There's your champagne coolie.

350
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,029
Well, looks like
it's just you and me, cowboy.

351
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,633
Yeah, I guess so.

352
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,594
Well, here we are.

353
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,274
I am beat.

354
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,032
That's nice.

355
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,993
So...

356
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,073
So do you have any idea when
the Nicole Millers are coming in?

357
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,796
Oh, yeah, the Nicole Millers.

358
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,473
Well, the funniest thing.

359
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,949
I've learned that the new shipment's
coming by boat...

360
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,396
...which does tend to take a bit longer,
what with the waves and all.

361
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,518
So you'll just have to be
a little bit patient.

362
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,478
So you have no idea
when they'll arrive?

363
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,790
No, I'm really not sure.

364
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,829
How can you love a guy like that?
He's a mess.

365
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,433
I don't see them together at all.

366
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,071
- Ethan?
- Yes?

367
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,390
Hi, it's me, Jesse.

368
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,118
George Hamilton's
personal assistant.

369
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,636
- Right, right. How are you?
- Good. Good to see you.

370
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,199
- This is Jerry.
- Hello.

371
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,793
Yeah.

372
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,313
Ethan, what brings you to town?

373
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,710
Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat.

374
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,953
You're kidding. Listen, maybe
you and I should get together.

375
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,873
Have you been on the slide
at Club USA? It's intense.

376
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,952
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Are you asking him out?

377
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,873
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

378
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,632
Right in front of me?

379
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,392
How do you know
we're not together?

380
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,438
Two guys sitting, laughing,
drinking champagne coolies.

381
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,991
I don't know.
I just didn't think you were.

382
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,116
Well, we're sitting here together.

383
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,474
Why wouldn't you think that?

384
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,879
I don't know. I just didn't.

385
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,110
Well, it's very emasculating.

386
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,834
- Hello?
- This is Bob from The Andover Shop.

387
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,673
I'm trying to reach Craig Stewart.
He left this number.

388
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,110
Oh, is it important?

389
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,874
- Well...
- Hey, let me ask you something.

390
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,918
Do you know when the Nicole Millers
are coming in from Milan?

391
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,069
Nicole Millers?

392
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,392
We aren't expecting any Nicole Millers.
In fact, we have too many as it is.

393
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,191
Well, do you have any
in a size four?

394
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,079
Yes, several.

395
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,073
Just tell him he doesn't have
to be in tomorrow until 11.

396
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,357
Oh, yeah, I'll make sure
he gets the message.

397
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,638
They mak e wigs out of human hair?

398
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,916
And pay plenty for them.

399
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,993
Oh, sweet Maria.

400
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:46,388
Hey, let's go.

401
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,433
What are you doing in my car?

402
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,318
Hey, hey, where are you going?

403
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,835
- Hey, you just cost me some money.
- Hey, cool it, lady.

404
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,074
Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.

405
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,879
Police officers, freeze right there.

406
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,153
Okay, big daddy, take the hat off.

407
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,076
All right, turn to your right.

408
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,629
I said turn, pimp!

409
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,676
I'm not a pimp.
