1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,078
I love it when people
are complimented on their clothes.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,148
And they accept the compliment
as if it was about them.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,517
Nice tie. Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,391
The compliment is for the tie.
It's not for you. But we take it.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,831
And that's the job of clothes.
To get compliments for us.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,116
Because it's very hard
to get compliments...

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,590
...based on your human qualities.
Right? Let's face it.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,955
No matter how nice you are,
nobody is gonna say:

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,076
"Hey, nice person."

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,639
It's much easier to be a bastard and
just try and match the colours up.

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,833
Oh, look at this.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,356
Boy. Oh, I miss the days when
they made toys that could kill a kid.

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,390
Oh, cool. Look at that.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,591
Yeah, I'm right there with you.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,151
That is a Schwinn Sting-Ray.
And it's the girls' model.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,153
Oh, I always wanted one
of these when I was little.

17
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,794
What do you think, Jerry?

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,673
Jerry. What do you think?

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,479
Oh, yeah, it would be great
for your paper route.

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,039
I love it. I'm getting it.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,710
Can you help me get it down, Jerr?
Jerry.

22
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,753
- Your friend needs some help.
- The only way to really help her...

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,672
...is to just let her be.

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,392
Hey.

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,433
- A little baby girl?
- Doctor says it could be any day now.

26
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,319
So, Carrie, you and Susan
are cousins.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,709
So your baby daughter is gonna be
Susan's second cousin, right?

28
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,917
- So, what does that make me?
- It doesn't make you anything.

29
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,156
Well, so, legally, I could
marry your daughter.

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,318
So have you picked out a name yet?

31
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,670
Well, we've narrowed
it down to a few.

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,068
We like Kimberly.

33
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,715
Oh, boy.

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,797
You don't like Kimberly?

35
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,311
- What else you got?
- How about Joan?

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,829
- Come on, I'm eating here.
- George.

37
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,713
- Pamela?
- Pamela?

38
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,033
All right. I'll tell you what.

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,509
You look like nice people.
I'm gonna help you out.

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,672
You want a beautiful name? Soda.

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,758
- What?
- Soda.

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,031
S-O-D-A. Soda.

43
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,390
I don't know.
It sounds a little strange.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,594
All names sound strange
the first time you hear them.

45
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,955
Are you telling me people
loved the name Blanche...

46
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,315
...the first time they heard it?

47
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,512
- Yeah, but Soda?
- Yeah, that's right.

48
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,796
- It's working.
- We'll put it on the list.

49
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,831
I solve problems.
That's just what I do.

50
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,748
Yeah, let's look at that boy.

51
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,754
That's good.

52
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,558
You're going to town with that turkey.

53
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,790
Oh, yeah. I got a big appetite.

54
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,998
Oh, Jerry. You got no mustard.

55
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,873
- It's on the door.
- What, this yellow stuff?

56
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,871
No, I said, mustard, Jerry. Dijon.

57
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,112
I still wanna do it.

58
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,279
No.

59
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,394
That's bush league. No.

60
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,071
Hey, wait. You're just gonna
leave it there?

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,390
- It's half a pound of turkey.
- I can't eat that.

62
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,312
You can't eat a sandwich
without Dijon.

63
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,950
Yeah, you're right. I really should keep
more of your favourites on hand.

64
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,593
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm getting a vibe here.

65
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,231
What, are you unhappy
with our arrangement?

66
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,712
What arrangement?

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,718
I was under the impression that
I could take anything I wanted...

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,950
...from your fridge. You take
whatever from mine.

69
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,515
Let me know when you get
something in there, and I will.

70
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,394
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

71
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,393
Hey. What's with your neck?

72
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,869
It's still killing me from having
to get that bike off the wall...

73
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,359
...by myself.

74
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,393
Well, if it's any consolation,
I did get her number.

75
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,636
I think I really strained it.

76
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,916
Oh, I doubt you strained it.
Maybe you pulled it.

77
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,672
- Maybe.
- Did you twist it?

78
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,671
- You could have twisted it?
- I don't know.

79
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,552
Did you wrench it?
Did you jam it?

80
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,075
- Maybe you squeezed it and turned it?
- Why don't you...

81
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,515
...just shut the hell up.
- All right.

82
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,152
God, man, this is killing me.

83
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,995
I would give that bike to the person
who could make this pain go away.

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,432
- You're really hurting, huh?
- Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.

85
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,670
Well, you're arterioles
have constricted.

86
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,438
All right, lean forward. Relax.

87
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,716
- What? What?
- Encounter shiatsu.

88
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,791
Wait a minute. You know
what you're doing?

89
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,350
Oh, yeah. A wise man once
taught me the healing power...

90
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,875
...of the body's
natural pressure points.

91
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,071
He sells T-shirts near
the World Trade Center.

92
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,959
He's a genius.

93
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,599
Here we go.
Here we go.

94
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,637
All right, from pain
will come pleasure.

95
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,839
Voilà.

96
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,312
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

97
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:06,268
Wow, that is unbelievable.

98
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,635
That pain is totally gone.

99
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,475
What's even more amazing is
his formal training is in paediatrics.

100
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,553
All right. My work is done here.

101
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,836
Oh, man. Kramer, thank you.

102
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,634
- You can send that bike over any time.
- What?

103
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,549
- What is he talking about?
- I don't know.

104
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,109
You said you'd give the bike
to whoever fixes your neck.

105
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,788
- You really think he wants the bike?
- Oh, yeah.

106
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,313
But it took him like 10 seconds.

107
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,478
Well, that's the most he's
worked in the last four months.

108
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,239
- I think they really went for that Soda.
- What are you, crazy?

109
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,595
They hated it.
They were just humouring you.

110
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,876
All right. Very good.
Believe me.

111
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,793
- That kid's going to be called Soda.
- I can tell you...

112
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,757
...I would never name my child Soda.

113
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,871
Oh, no, no, no.
No, of course not.

114
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,759
I got a great name for our kids,
a real original.

115
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,837
You wanna hear what it is?
Are you ready?

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,399
Yeah.

117
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,199
- What is that, sign language?
- No.

118
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,591
Seven.

119
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,950
Seven Costanza. You're serious?

120
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,628
Yeah, it's a beautiful name
for a boy or a girl.

121
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,951
- Especially a girl. Or a boy.
- I don't think so.

122
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,516
- What, you don't like the name?
- It's not a name. It's a number.

123
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,711
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number.

124
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,030
So not only is it
an all-around beautiful name...

125
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,397
...it is also a living tribute.
- It's awful. I hate it.

126
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,038
- Well, that's the name.
- Oh, no it is not.

127
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,755
No child of mine is ever going
to be named Seven.

128
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,757
All right. Let's just
stay calm here.

129
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,275
Don't get all crazy on me.

130
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,511
Seven? Yeah, I guess
I could see it.

131
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,319
Seven. Seven periods of school.
Seven beatings a day.

132
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,950
Roughly seven stitches a beating,
and, eventually, seven years to life.

133
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,758
You're doing that child
quite a service.

134
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,359
Yes, I am.

135
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,909
I defy you to come up
with a better name than Seven.

136
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,559
All right. Let's see.

137
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,790
How about Mug?

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,991
Mug Costanza.

139
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,388
That's original.

140
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,438
- Ketchup. Pretty name for a girl.
- Right. You having a good time?

141
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,239
I got 50 right here in the cupboard.
How about Bisquick?

142
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,349
Pimento? Gherkin? Sauce?

143
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,910
- Maxwell House?
- All right, already.

144
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,838
This is a very key issue with me,
Jerry.

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,399
I had this name for a long time.

146
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,959
Oh, I forgot to call Christie.

147
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,673
That's the one you met in the store?

148
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,479
She had this great black and white
dress with a scoop neck.

149
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,551
She looked like some
kind of superhero.

150
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,593
And you met her in an antique store.
I don't know how you do it.

151
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,233
I'm not engaged.

152
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,438
- I got it.
- Got what?

153
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,194
I got the answer, Jerry.
Refrigerator problem is solved.

154
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,795
Oh, it's no problem.
You can take whatever you want.

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,150
I will. But now I'm accountable.

156
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,151
All right, I take what I want. Here.

157
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,639
And I write it down.

158
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,950
One cupcake.

159
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,714
And then I put it in the bowl.

160
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,075
There. Very simple.

161
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,876
- Sort of a mooching inventory.
- No, not mooching.

162
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,871
Because at the end of the week
you add them.

163
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,758
- And you give me the bill.
- All right.

164
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,319
Look, I gotta run some errands.

165
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,034
When Elaine comes by with that bike,
hang on to it for me.

166
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,276
Kramer, I don't know
if you're getting that bike.

167
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,238
Oh, yes, I am.
We had a verbal contract.

168
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,551
If we can't take each other
at our word, all is lost.

169
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,398
Oh, yeah, yeah, put that on my tab.

170
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,635
Well, this is it.
The food is atrocious.

171
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,633
But the busboys
are the best in the city.

172
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,753
- May I take your coat, miss?
- Yes, thank you.

173
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,195
- The same outfit?
- The exact same outfit.

174
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,675
- How many days between encounters?
- Three.

175
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,311
Three days. Well, maybe you caught
her on the cusp of a new wash cycle.

176
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,955
You know, she did laundry
the day after she met you.

177
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,156
Everything got clean.
She started all over again.

178
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,669
Possibly. But then shouldn't the outfit
only reappear at the end of the cycle?

179
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,075
Maybe she moved it up
in the rotation.

180
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,396
Why? It's our first date.
She's already in reruns.

181
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,435
- Very curious.
- Indeed.

182
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,676
Einstein wore the exact same outfit
every day.

183
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,713
Well, if she splits the atom,
I'll let it slide.

184
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,994
- All right. I'm heading home.
- Did Susan change her mind...

185
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,276
...about the name?
- Not yet, but she's weakening.

186
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,072
Just because your life is destroyed...

187
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,470
...don't destroy someone else's.

188
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,319
It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry.
My idol.

189
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,233
- How about Mickey?
- Mickey?

190
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,598
Mickey...

191
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,272
- Is this your half a can of soda?
- Nope, that's yours.

192
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,317
My half is gone.

193
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,473
- What?
- Yeah.

194
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,114
I put my half a can here in the tab.

195
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:54,159
- Why? What's your beef?
- You cannot buy half a can of soda.

196
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,357
- Well, why not?
- I don't wanna get into the physics of it.

197
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,909
But you know the sound
a can makes when you open it?

198
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,354
- Yeah.
- That is the sound...

199
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,192
...of you buying a whole can.

200
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,750
And the same goes for this.
Okay?

201
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,356
When you pierce the skin of a piece
of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit.

202
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,954
Not a third of an apple.
Not a half of a banana.

203
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,838
- All right.
- You bite it, you bought it.

204
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,235
All right. I'll make
the necessary adjustments.

205
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,231
- All right.
- Thank you.

206
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,755
Oh, so how's the neck?

207
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,188
Nice and loose?

208
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,595
Lookit, Kramer, you are
not getting this bike.

209
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,911
I don't even know why you want it.
I mean, it's a girls' bike.

210
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,991
It's a verbal contract.
We had a deal.

211
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,428
No, we didn't.

212
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,113
You take these things too literally.

213
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:37,511
It's like saying you're hungry
enough to eat horse.

214
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,792
Well my friend Jay Riemenschneider
eats horse all the time.

215
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,315
He gets it from his butcher.

216
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,913
This is not the point.

217
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,470
The point is,
you just can't have the bike.

218
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,870
Boy, I am really surprised at you.

219
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,077
You are the last person I figured
would do something like this.

220
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,670
I mean, George, yeah, I can see that.
Even Jerry.

221
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,709
But not you, Elaine.
I always put you up here.

222
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,189
They're over here.

223
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,909
Now you're all:

224
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,830
- All right.
- Yeah.

225
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,669
Come on. It's a fantastic name.

226
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,270
It's a real original. Nobody else is
gonna have it. And I absolutely love it.

227
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,391
Well, I don't know how original
it's gonna be.

228
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,355
- Why not?
- Well, I was telling Carrie...

229
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,751
...about our argument. And when I
told them the name, they just loved it.

230
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,991
- So, what are you saying?
- They're naming their baby Seven.

231
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,276
What? They're stealing the name?

232
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,668
That's my name. I made it up.

233
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,393
I can't believe they're using it.

234
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,158
Now, it's not gonna be original.

235
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,833
It's gonna lose all its cachet.

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,070
I don't know how much
cachet it had to begin with.

237
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,713
Oh, it's got cachet, baby.

238
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,553
It's got cachet up the ying-yang.

239
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,717
Oh, God.

240
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,788
Oh, God.

241
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,599
Kramer.

242
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,672
Watch your step.

243
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,713
Oh, stupid Kramer.

244
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,559
Excuse me, Elaine.

245
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,278
Over here.

246
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,317
I thought that was you.
You're Jerry's friend.

247
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,351
Yeah. Yeah.

248
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,239
- Christie?
- Yes, how you doing?

249
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,078
I'm fine.

250
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,390
Well, I gotta run.
It was good to see you.

251
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,160
Okay. It was good to...

252
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,117
Good to see you.

253
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,589
- Looking good.
- Hey, Cosmo.

254
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,228
- Nice wheels.
- You got that right.

255
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,073
- Hey, you're riding a girls' bike.
- Kramer.

256
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,078
Kramer.

257
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,917
- Hello.
- Hello, Ken.

258
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,150
It's George Costanza.

259
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,197
I think we need to talk.

260
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,312
Kramer.

261
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,830
- Kramer!
- Hey.

262
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,878
God. Is Kramer back
from his little joyride yet?

263
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,750
- Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
- His chiropractic job was a crock.

264
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,229
I mean, it's even worse
than it was before.

265
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,158
I'd think Kramer
would have a knack...

266
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,197
...for moving a person's spine
around.

267
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,039
Hey, you know what?

268
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,430
I think I ran into that girl
from the antique store.

269
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,751
- What's her name, Christie?
- You saw her? What was she wearing?

270
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,039
I don't know. I couldn't see.
I couldn't look down...

271
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,555
...because of my neck.
- Didn't you get a glimpse?

272
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,438
- An impression?
- What do you care?

273
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,835
Both times I've seen her,
she's worn the same dress.

274
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,880
- Did you have a nice ride?
- Oh, great ride.

275
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,918
Oh, that's good,
because it was your last.

276
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,797
What are you talking about?
We had a deal.

277
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,912
You gotta give me back that bike.
Look at this! Look!

278
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,991
I couldn't even crawl
out of bed this morning.

279
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,152
Bed? You should be sleeping on
a wooden board for at least a week.

280
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,716
- What? You never told me that.
- Well, it's common sense.

281
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,030
What is he talking about?
He's being ridiculous.

282
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,792
Look, Jerry, you know
the whole story.

283
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,359
- You should settle this.
- Yeah.

284
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,272
I'm flattered you'd
appeal to my wisdom.

285
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,670
But, unfortunately,
my friendship to each of you...

286
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,671
...precludes my getting involved.

287
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,149
What you need is
an impartial mediator.

288
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,749
Yeah, I'd go for that.
Would you go for that?

289
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,797
All right, I'm down.

290
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,675
It would have to be someone
who hasn't heard the story.

291
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,832
Someone who is unencumbered
by any emotional attachment.

292
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,479
Someone whose heart is so dark...

293
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,599
...it cannot be swayed by pity, emotion
or human compassion of any kind.

294
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,798
So that's the situation.

295
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,437
You present an interesting dilemma.

296
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,476
Each of you seemingly
has a legitimate claim to the bicycle.

297
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,112
And yet the bicycle can have
only one rightful owner.

298
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,396
Quite the conundrum.

299
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,190
As a federal employee,
I believe the law is all we have.

300
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,476
It's all that separates us
from the savages...

301
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,551
...who don't deserve
the privilege of mail.

302
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,029
Stuffing parcels in mailboxes,
where they don't belong.

303
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,912
Newman!

304
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,151
But you must promise
that you will abide by my decision...

305
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,199
...no matter how unjust
it may seem to either of you.

306
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,271
Do I have your word?

307
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,271
- All right, yeah.
- Yeah.

308
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,557
All right. Let's begin.

309
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,638
My cocoa.

310
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,273
Why can't we use Seven?

311
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,756
It's my name. I made it up.
You can't just steal it.

312
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,951
Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant.

313
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,918
You already postponed the wedding.
Who knows if you'll get married.

314
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,317
Hey, hey, don't worry about me.
I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle.

315
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,391
Look, we're both big
Mickey Mantle fans.

316
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,278
And we love the name.
It's very unusual.

317
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,000
What happened to Soda?
I thought we all agreed on Soda.

318
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,509
- We don't care for Soda.
- You don't care for Soda?

319
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,438
No, no. We don't like Soda at all.

320
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,632
How do you not like Soda?
It's bubbly. It's refreshing.

321
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,119
- What is it?
- I felt something.

322
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,077
- Are you okay?
- I'm going into labour.

323
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,038
Oh, God. Okay, let's not panic.
Let's just get to the hospital.

324
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,555
- Okay.
- I got the suitcase packed right here.

325
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,756
- Let's go.
- What about Six?

326
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,515
Nine? Thirteen?
Thirteen is no good.

327
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,796
Fourteen. Fourteen.

328
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,349
Are you okay, Jerry?
You seem quiet.

329
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,314
No, I'm just a little worn-out.

330
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,751
- I know exactly what you mean.
- Oh, I'm sure you do.

331
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,235
What in God's name
is going on here?

332
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,595
Is she wearing the same thing
over and over again?

333
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,228
Or does she have a closet full
of these lik e Superman?

334
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,595
I've got to unlock this mystery.

335
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,830
Oh, my God.

336
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,678
I can't go to the movies like this.

337
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,274
Do you mind if we go back
to my apartment so I can change?

338
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,839
Change? Yes, I think
that's a super idea.

339
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,478
- Are we almost there?
- Just keep breathing, okay?

340
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,358
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

341
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,559
You know, the thing is, I kind
of promised the widow Mantle...

342
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,597
...that I would name my baby Seven.

343
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,274
Now's not the best time, George.

344
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,829
It's just that I know her.
And, boy...

345
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,877
George, she's in labour.

346
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,512
So am I.

347
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,628
Well, you both presented
very convincing arguments.

348
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,076
On the one hand, Elaine...

349
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,674
...your promise was given in haste.

350
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,075
But was it not still a promise?

351
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,038
And, Kramer, you did provide a
service in exchange for compensation.

352
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,829
But does the fee, once paid,
not entitle the buyer...

353
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,276
...to some assurance
of reliability?

354
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,318
These were not easy questions
to answer.

355
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,833
Not for any man.

356
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,880
But I have made a decision.

357
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,591
We will cut the bike
down the middle...

358
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,671
...and give half to each of you.

359
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,916
What? This is your solution?

360
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,798
To ruin the bike?

361
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,349
All right. Fine, fine.
Go ahead.

362
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,398
- Cut the stupid thing in half.
- No, no, no. Give it to her.

363
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,869
I'd rather it belong to another
than see it destroyed.

364
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,871
Newman, give it to her.
I beg you.

365
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,396
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Not so fast, Elaine.

366
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,232
Only the bike's true owner...

367
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,153
...would rather give it away
than see it come to harm.

368
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,834
- Kramer, the bike is yours.
- What?

369
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,037
Sweet justice.
Newman, you are wise.

370
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,599
But this isn't fair.

371
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,951
Lookit, my neck is still hurting me.
And now you have the bike?

372
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,673
Well, tell it to the judge, honey.

373
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,629
I'm going for a ride.

374
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,034
Here we are.

375
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:44,672
So this is the fortress of solitude.

376
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,193
Well, I guess I'll go change.

377
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,234
Yes, change. By all means, change.

378
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,712
August 17 th, 1992.

379
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,399
The same dress.

380
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,597
She never changes. Oh, my God.

381
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,189
She's gotta have hundreds
of these dresses.

382
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,193
There must be a secret stash
around here somewhere.

383
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,794
- Are you looking for something?
- I thought you were changing.

384
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,389
You know, maybe we should
just call it a night.

385
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,830
No, no, no. Come on.
Put something else on.

386
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,399
It's early. Let's go out.

387
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,035
I think I'm just gonna go to bed.

388
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,875
You know, I'm kind of tired myself.
I'll just sleep here on the couch.

389
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:40,430
In the morning, we'll walk out together.
Both dressed, different clothes.

390
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,868
I'll be in the same clothes.

391
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,190
You'll be in different clothes,
as it's your place.

392
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,033
We'll go down. Me in my same
clothes, you in different clothes.

393
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,117
Jerry, I don't think so.

394
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,592
- Wanna throw something on,
walk me...

395
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,119
...to a cab?
- Get out.

396
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,477
Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow.
I'll help you lay it out on the bed.

397
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,992
- Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe.
- You're really being very selfish.

398
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,475
Be nice if you'd think
of someone other than yourself.

399
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,835
- I'm having a baby.
- You're not getting Seven.

400
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,116
- Now, get out of here.
- Please, I have so little.

401
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,430
- I'm sorry, sir. Family only.
- I'm family.

402
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,397
I'm having sex with the cousin.

403
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:18,473
Seven! Seven!

404
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,076
Hello, Christie. I was wondering
if we could get together again.

405
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,873
Oh, really?

406
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,996
You can't break up
with me over the phone.

407
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,839
You gotta do this in person.
It doesn't have to be one-on-one.

408
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,991
Bring a group of friends.
I just wanna see you.

409
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,516
Don't hang up on me. Why do you
always wear the same dress? Hello?

410
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,390
Jerry, if you're gonna be
snacking on these...

411
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,630
...you can't expect me to pay
for the whole box.

412
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,236
All right, Hobo Joe.

413
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,430
I didn't wanna put a damper
on your smorgasbord.

414
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,672
But it's the end of the week,
so I added up your tab.

415
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,032
I know, pretty steep.

416
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,872
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.

417
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,072
- Few do.
- I'm good for it.

418
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,397
Yeah, well, until this bill is paid,
the food court is closed.

419
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,154
Closed? All right.

420
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,108
I'll get that money for you in five
minutes. And don't eat any more.

421
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,988
Hey, that's my bike.

422
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,191
- Gangway.
- This is my bike.

423
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,073
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I bought it from Kramer.

424
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,033
He was hard up for cash.

425
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,714
Fifty bucks. Can you believe it?

426
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,152
I had to make some
minor modifications.

427
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,511
Solid tires, reinforced seat post...

428
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,951
...heavy-duty shocks.
But, baby, this is one sweet ride.

429
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,879
No, you gotta give me back that bike.
Newman, give it.

430
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,356
Elaine, Elaine.
Help me. Help me.

431
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,590
Help. Help. Help.
