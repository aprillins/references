1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,004
Women put on perfume
in an interesting way.

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,400
Ever notice that, guys?

3
00:00:07,574 --> 00:00:11,943
They have their little key,
Stratego little areas.

4
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:19,907
Places they think we're going.

5
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,912
And they always hit this one.

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,523
Women are convinced...

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:31,062
...that this is the most action-packed
area that could ever happen...

8
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:33,290
...in the dating world.

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,491
What is that, ladies?
What is happening here?

10
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:38,398
Is that in case you slap the guy
or something?

11
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,630
He still finds you intriguing?

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,773
"Oh, Chanel!"

13
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:52,042
She's a pianist, a classical pianist!
She plays the piano!

14
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,810
She's a brilliant woman!

15
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:57,252
I sat in her living room,
she played the Waldstein Sonata.

16
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,324
The Waldstein!

17
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,088
We did a crossword puzzle
together in bed.

18
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,393
It was the most fun I ever
had in my entire life!

19
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,332
Do you hear me? In my life!

20
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,597
You know?

21
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:16,241
Were you talking?
I couldn't hear anything.

22
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,942
I was telling you about Noel.

23
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:22,775
Oh, Noel, yeah.
The one that plays the bongos.

24
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,481
So sidesplittingly funny.

25
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:28,919
All right, I'm sorry. What about her?

26
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,954
You think I'm gonna repeat
the whole thing?

27
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,490
You told me you like her.
Everything's going good.

28
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,287
No, everything's not going good.

29
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,158
I'm very uncomfortable.
I have no power.

30
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,855
Why should she have
the upper hand?

31
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:43,059
For once, I'd like the upper hand.
I have no hand, no hand at all.

32
00:01:43,236 --> 00:01:45,033
She has the hand. I have no hand.

33
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,703
-Hand me that, would you?
-Yeah.

34
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,136
How do I get the hand?

35
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,937
We all want the hand.
Hand is tough to get.

36
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,137
You gotta get the hand
right from the opening.

37
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:57,477
She's playing a recital
at the McBierny School.

38
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,118
I got two extra tickets.
You and Elaine could go.

39
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,777
Yeah, that sounds like something.

40
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,018
Then afterwards, maybe
we could all go out together.

41
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,923
You know, she'll see me
with my friends.

42
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:12,496
She'll observe me
as I really am, as myself.

43
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,225
Maybe I can get
some hand that way.

44
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,159
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

45
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,033
Hey, smell my arm.

46
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,069
-What?
-Smell it. Smell it.

47
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,541
With all due respect,
I don't think so.

48
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,806
-Jerry, smell.
-That smells good. What is that?

49
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,143
-The beach.
-The beach?

50
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,909
Did you go swimming?
It's 29 degrees.

51
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,714
No, I just joined
the Polar Bear Club.

52
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:38,483
-You joined the Polar Bears?
-What the hell's a Polar Bear?

53
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,388
These people go swimming
in the winter. They're terrific.

54
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,189
I just took my first swim today.

55
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:46,492
-It's invigorating.
-Yeah...

56
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,896
...so is shock therapy.

57
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:52,203
-What is that, a PEZ dispenser?
-Yeah. You want one?

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,104
I just bought it at the flea market.
You want one?

59
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,836
Hey, what goes on there, exactly?

60
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,309
You don't know?

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,971
No, I know. I know.

62
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,212
You think they have fleas there,
don't you?

63
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,081
-No.
-Yes, you do, Biff.

64
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,716
You've never been,
and you think they have fleas there.

65
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,419
All right, I think they have
fleas there. So what?

66
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,394
-Here, you want this?
-You don't want it?

67
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,933
-No, I bought five of them.
-Wow, great. Thanks.

68
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:30,203
I don't know how anyone does this.
This must be so nerve-racking.

69
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,968
How do they warm up their fingers?

70
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,375
They have a piano backstage
they warm up on.

71
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,071
No. We would have heard it.

72
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:38,774
You think they just crack
their knuckles and come out?

73
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,443
-I told her we'd go out afterwards.
-Sure.

74
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:45,318
Don't applaud when she stops playing
the first time. It's not over yet.

75
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,426
I really resent that.
That's directed at me, isn't it?

76
00:03:52,465 --> 00:03:54,797
Is this okay? Can I do this?

77
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,077
Oh, God.

78
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:15,043
Something I said?

79
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,644
It's John Mollica.

80
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,983
Oh. Oh, John. Oh, hi, John.

81
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,590
-Hi.
-What are you doing out here?

82
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,919
I was just at this recital...

83
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:31,586
...and Jerry put this PEZ dispenser
on my leg...

84
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:34,528
...and I just started laughing.

85
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,835
-Jerry's in there?
-Yeah.

86
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,370
-I heard you guys broke up.
-We did. We're just hanging out.

87
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,508
Really? Boy...

88
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,543
...you really look great.

89
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,204
Oh, thank you.

90
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,393
Hey, are you still friends
with Richie Appel?

91
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,462
Oh, Richie? He's been doing comedy
in L.A. for a couple of years.

92
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,427
He just got back a month ago.

93
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,432
He's kind of messed up on drugs.

94
00:06:10,903 --> 00:06:12,200
I don't know what to do.

95
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,237
Have you thought
about an intervention?

96
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,535
-What's that?
-You get all his friends in a room...

97
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,110
...and they confront him
to try to get him into rehab.

98
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:22,247
It's a very popular thing now.

99
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,975
Well, he'd never listen to anyone.

100
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,187
Except, of course, Jerry.

101
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:31,585
He'd listen to Jerry.

102
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,489
Jerry would have to be involved.

103
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:39,597
He really respects Jerry.

104
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,237
I'm sorry, George. I'm sorry.

105
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:52,134
What did you put the PEZ dispenser
on her leg for?

106
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:55,940
-I don't know. It was an impulse.
-What kind of a sick impulse is that?

107
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,450
How could I know
she'd start to laugh?

108
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:02,417
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I am.

109
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,688
-Could we go in already?
-What are we gonna tell her?

110
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:09,055
-I'll tell her I was the one who laughed.
-No, don't say a word.

111
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,789
If she thinks my friends are jerks,
then I'm a jerk.

112
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,367
Remind me to talk to you
about something.

113
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,969
-What about?
-Hey, we're discussing something.

114
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,196
I know, but I'm distracted now.

115
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:21,965
What are you, a baby?

116
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,740
All right, tell him.

117
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,640
When I was outside,
I ran into John Mollica.

118
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:28,337
-Really? John Mollica?
-Yeah.

119
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,880
The guy that used to bartend
at the comedy club.

120
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,540
-How's he doing?
-He's good.

121
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:34,185
Could we cut to the chase?

122
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,312
"Cut to the chase"?

123
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,158
-Yeah.
-What are you, Joe Hollywood?

124
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:42,891
A lot of people say it.

125
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,490
I would lose that.

126
00:07:44,664 --> 00:07:46,564
What's that?

127
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,962
"Lose that"? That's not
a Hollywood expression.

128
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,369
Yes, it is.

129
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,400
Anyway....

130
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,600
So John told me that Richie
is in town from Los Angeles...

131
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:59,642
...and he's really
messed up on drugs.

132
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,905
So I told him
he should do an intervention.

133
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:05,141
-Really? An intervention?
-We got a situation over here!

134
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,477
-But he wants you to be a part of it.
-Why me?

135
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,055
He says Richie really respects you,
and he would listen to you.

136
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,251
These things are really hard to load.

137
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:22,299
All right, okay. All right, I'm going in.

138
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:25,699
-We got to talk about this.
-All right.

139
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,534
Hi. Hi. Hi.

140
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:35,806
-You were wonderful. Wonderful.
-No, no.

141
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,348
These are my friends,
Elaine and Jerry. Noel.

142
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,042
You play a hell of a piano.

143
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:44,379
Yeah, I was really moved.
Really moved.

144
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:46,991
Didn't you hear
that person laughing?

145
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,060
I couldn't play. I was humiliated!

146
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,094
I'm sure it wasn't at you.

147
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,062
Well, then what was she laughing at?

148
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,794
-PEZ?
-No, thank you.

149
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,100
Did you see her?

150
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,069
Me? No, l....

151
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,936
Anyone who would laugh
at a recital...

152
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,340
..is probably some sort
of lunatic, anyway.

153
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:11,848
I mean, only a sick, twisted mind
could be that rude and ignorant.

154
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,181
Well, you know,
maybe some mental defective...

155
00:09:15,354 --> 00:09:18,414
...put something stupid on her leg.

156
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:23,989
Even if this so-called mental defective
did put something on her leg...

157
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,790
...she's still the one who laughed.

158
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:31,296
I'll never forget that laugh
for the rest of my life.

159
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:36,365
I'm sure she would apologize
if she could.

160
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,102
Probably someone
is holding her back...

161
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,974
...maybe against
every fiber of her being.

162
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:45,811
If she wants to continue to have a fiber
of her being, she'll be very careful.

163
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:47,976
-Don't hit me.
-Stop it.

164
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,216
All right. So, you ready?

165
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,120
We'll go out,
and we'll have a bite to eat.

166
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:57,619
I don't feel like it tonight.

167
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,761
-We'll be outside.
-Yeah.

168
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,194
It was nice meeting you.

169
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:05,796
By the way, how do you warm up
your fingers before you play?

170
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,270
I just crack my knuckles.

171
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:10,967
Come on, we'll have a good time.

172
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:13,441
-Well, I'm really not in the mood.
-Come on....

173
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,379
I said, I don't feel like it.

174
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,020
All right....

175
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:26,249
I'll-- I'll call you.

176
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:30,191
I'll call you,
and we'll talk on the phone.

177
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:33,890
Have a telephone communique.

178
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,997
So, fine. Everything's fine.
Everything good?

179
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:40,570
Good. I feel good. Fine.
That's fine. That's good.

180
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,970
Okay. Okey-doke.

181
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,316
You know, I think Kramer might
have been indirectly responsible...

182
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,247
...for getting Richie
involved in drugs.

183
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,286
What? How?

184
00:10:55,454 --> 00:10:57,888
A few years ago, the comedy club
had a softball team.

185
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,786
Kramer was our first baseman.

186
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,587
You couldn't get anything by him.
He was unbelievable.

187
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:07,699
Anyway, this one game, we came back
to win from, like, eight runs behind.

188
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,528
So Kramer says to Richie:

189
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:13,069
"Why don't you dump the bucket
of Gatorade on Marty Benson's head?"

190
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,273
-The club owner.
-Yeah.

191
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,205
So Richie goes ahead and does it.

192
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,674
-So? What happened?
-What happened?

193
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,178
The guy was, like, 67 years old.
It was freezing out.

194
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,783
He caught a cold, developed
pneumonia, a month later...

195
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:29,614
-...he was dead.
-Shut up.

196
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,252
All the comedians were happy...

197
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,859
...because he's one of these
club owners nobody liked.

198
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,858
But Richie was never the same.

199
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,896
-What about Kramer?
-He's the same.

200
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,458
Are you sure you want me, John?

201
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,537
I mean, I haven't spoken
to Richie in two years.

202
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,869
I don't have a good apartment
for an intervention.

203
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,705
The furniture,
it's very nonconfrontational.

204
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,110
All right, all right. Goodbye.

205
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:58,807
Remember Richie Appel?

206
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:03,487
Oh, sure. The guy I told to pour the
Gatorade that killed Marty Benson?

207
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:09,351
Right. John Mollica is organizing
some kind of intervention for him.

208
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:10,893
We're having it here.

209
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:13,562
Can I get in on that?

210
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,728
What do you think,
it's like a poker game?

211
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,794
-ls Elaine going?
-Yeah.

212
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,836
Well, I knew him as well as she did.

213
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,405
Yeah, but John invited her.

214
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,805
So wait, you don't want me
to intervene?

215
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,741
No, intervene, go ahead.
Intervene all you want.

216
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,246
I'm just afraid you might be interfering
while we're intervening.

217
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,452
-Yeah?
-It's George.

218
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:37,850
Come on up.

219
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:41,117
Stop smelling your arm!

220
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,527
You know, I got a great idea
for a cologne.

221
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,186
It's called "The Beach."

222
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:48,595
You spray it on, and it's just like
you came home from the beach.

223
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,259
A cologne that smells
like the beach.

224
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:56,136
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but that's not a bad idea.

225
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,868
Tell me about it.

226
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,744
Why don't you call Steve D'Giff?

227
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,381
He works in the marketing department
at Calvin Klein.

228
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:07,246
In fact, he's a good friend
of John Mollica and Richie, also.

229
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,977
Okay.

230
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:12,387
Well, it's over. It's definitely over.

231
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,053
-She broke up with you?
-No, but she's going to.

232
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:18,685
I can sense it. We had this
terrible phone conversation.

233
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:22,163
I was so nervous before I called,
I made a list of things to talk about.

234
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,165
What was on the list?

235
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,167
Let's see.

236
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:29,397
"I'm very good
at going in reverse in my car.

237
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,809
Why isn't Postum
a more popular drink?"

238
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,414
Yeah, Postum is underrated.

239
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,452
Anyway, there was all this tension.

240
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:45,749
I asked her if she wanted
to go out to dinner...

241
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,120
...and she said,
"No, maybe we could have lunch."

242
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,592
-You know what that means.
-What's wrong with lunch?

243
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,357
Lunch is fine at the beginning,
then you move on to dinner.

244
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,558
You don't go back to lunch.
It's like being demoted.

245
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,530
I'll never do a crossword puzzle
with her again, I know it.

246
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,874
I like the jumble.
You ever do the jumble?

247
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,799
I have no power, you understand?

248
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,275
I need hand! I have no hand!

249
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,607
-Why don't you break up with her.
-What?

250
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,182
Break up with her.
You reverse everything that way.

251
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,219
A preemptive breakup.

252
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,582
A preemptive breakup.

253
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,894
-This is an incredible idea.
-Yeah.

254
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:27,191
I got nothing to lose.

255
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,493
We either break up,
which she would do anyway...

256
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:31,431
...but I go out with some dignity...

257
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,970
...or I completely turn the tables!

258
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,069
This is absolutely brilliant!

259
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:40,337
So I'm afraid l...

260
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,742
...am gonna have to
break up with you.

261
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,819
-You're breaking up with me?
-Yes.

262
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,187
I...

263
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,622
...am breaking up with you.

264
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,784
-Wow.
-Shocked?

265
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:59,158
-I really am.
-Never expected this, did you?

266
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:03,290
-I thought everything was fine.
-Well, live and learn.

267
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,363
Well, I don't understand.
You didn't enjoy being with me?

268
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,667
Didn't we have fun
doing the crossword puzzle?

269
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,507
Kind of.

270
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,407
-I'm very confused.
-Well, I didn't mean to hurt you, kid.

271
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,144
-I thought--
-Now, stop it, please.

272
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:23,846
What do you want?
I know I can make you happy.

273
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,821
When you're playing the piano...

274
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,259
...do you think about me?

275
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,865
-I don't know.
-This is what I'm talking about.

276
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,867
Okay, I'll think about you.

277
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:39,527
-All the time?
-All the time?

278
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,765
-You know--
-Okay, all the time.

279
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,275
-I can't hear you.
-All the time!

280
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,308
See? It's not so hard.

281
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,944
Go ahead. Smell. Smell it.

282
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,849
-Yeah? So?
-Now, you recognize it?

283
00:15:57,256 --> 00:15:58,553
I don't know.

284
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,892
The beach.

285
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:05,026
-What are you talking about?
-Oh, I'm talking about the beach.

286
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,789
What about it?

287
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,832
You know the way you smell...

288
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:14,166
...when you first come home
from the beach?

289
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:18,174
Well, I want to make
a cologne that captures...

290
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,177
...the essence of that smell.

291
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,308
Oh, yeah.

292
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,746
That is the dumbest idea
I've ever heard.

293
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:29,354
Whoa, wait a minute. You....

294
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,421
Did you hear what I just said?

295
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,892
You think people
are gonna pay $80 a bottle...

296
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,358
...to smell like dead fish
and seaweed?

297
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,590
That's why people take showers
when they come home from the beach.

298
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,760
It's an objectionable, offensive odor.

299
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,665
So you don't think
that it's a good idea?

300
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,838
The membranes get dry,
and it just starts bleeding.

301
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:02,611
Since I was a kid, so I have
to stick a tissue up there.

302
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,621
You have to work like that?

303
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,226
Yeah. Nobody minds.

304
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:12,526
Nobody's ever said anything to me.

305
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,195
There any ice cubes?
Whatever's in the freezer.

306
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,198
I looked. I don't see any ice cubes.

307
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,234
Well, then I guess
there's no ice cubes.

308
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:22,670
I can't drink this. It's warm.

309
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,542
John, shouldn't we rehearse this...

310
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,705
-...before Richie comes?
-What's the plan?

311
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,475
Do I have to talk?
I don't want to.

312
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,642
If he's not gonna talk,
then I don't want to.

313
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,482
-No, we all have to talk!
-What's the order?

314
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,556
Alphabetical order.
You're first, Roberta.

315
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,818
-Why am I first?
-Albano's your last name.

316
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:44,326
-Not anymore. I'm divorced.
-I'll go first.

317
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,123
-Oh, hey!
-Hey.

318
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:48,266
-ls this the interference?
-lntervention.

319
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,562
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, is it all right if I stay?

320
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,467
He can't stay.
This is for close friends only.

321
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,902
Hey, I'm a friend.

322
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,908
Who told him to pour the Gatorade
over Marty Benson's head?

323
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,012
-Oh, let him stay.
-Yeah.

324
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,843
Hey, I got somebody to make up
that cologne for me, bigmouth.

325
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:07,008
Somebody's gonna make that crap?

326
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:09,984
-Kramer!
-Hey, you guys! All right!

327
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,646
Come on in. These are some
of my Polar Bear buddies.

328
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,419
-They can't stay.
-You're having a party here?

329
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,186
No, we're having an intervention.

330
00:18:17,362 --> 00:18:20,490
An intervention? Who's intervening?

331
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:23,362
He's a friend of ours on drugs,
and we're gonna confront him.

332
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,332
Sure. We used to do that...

333
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,837
...when one of our Polar Bears stopped
coming. We'd go to his house:

334
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,339
"What, you don't want to be
a Polar Bear anymore?

335
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,037
-It's too cold for you?"
-It's him!

336
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,682
-What do we do?
-Hide!

337
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,386
It's not a surprise party!

338
00:18:41,553 --> 00:18:42,781
-Yeah?
-It's George.

339
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,889
Come on up.

340
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,218
It's not him.

341
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,623
You don't wanna go out with me
because I'm a bartender, right?

342
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:55,859
Look, you know, I don't really think
that this is appropriate right now.

343
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,628
Is it because I have a tissue
in my nose?

344
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,172
-You're getting warm.
-Hey, we just....

345
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,707
We just came from Chadway's.
What's going on?

346
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,742
The intervention.
We're waiting for Richie.

347
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:11,042
Right, the intervention.
Should we leave?

348
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,650
-Well....
-Elaine, hi.

349
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,411
Hi, Noel.

350
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:17,418
Well, you're looking well.

351
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,352
Jerry, let me tell you something.

352
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:23,086
A man without hand is not a man.

353
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,322
I've got so much hand,
I'm coming out my gloves.

354
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,760
I got to thank Kramer.

355
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,833
Even if I were dragged
through manure...

356
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,765
...I still wouldn't put that stuff on.

357
00:19:31,937 --> 00:19:35,270
This man is a genius! A genius!

358
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,635
-You think so?
-I don't think so, I know so.

359
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,242
Come here. I gotta talk to you.

360
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:42,175
The male kangaroo
doesn't have a pouch.

361
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,474
Only the female has it...

362
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:48,051
...so the male has pouch envy!

363
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:53,948
"Why should she have
this huge pouch and I have nothing?

364
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,890
I have things to carry too.

365
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,059
At least give me a pocket."

366
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,915
That laugh. That's the laugh.

367
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,984
-That's it! You're the one!
-No, no.

368
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:25,146
No, it was an accident.
It wasn't my fault! It was Jerry!

369
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:28,020
Jerry put a PEZ dispenser
on my leg!

370
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:32,129
You put a PEZ dispenser
on her leg during my recital?

371
00:20:32,297 --> 00:20:34,663
-I didn't know she would laugh.
-And, you....

372
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:37,165
You lied to me, George.
You lied to me!

373
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:41,067
No, l-- I didn't. What did I do?

374
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,973
Where are you going?

375
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:49,637
I am breaking up with you.

376
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,149
You can't break up with me.
I've got hand!

377
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,415
And you're gonna need it.

378
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,923
Noel!

379
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,360
-Hey, Richie!
-Hey, Richie.

380
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,198
So, what's going on?

381
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:13,003
So we start the intervention,
and it's pretty ugly from the get-go.

382
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,766
He's not listening, he's hostile,
he's talking back.

383
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,376
I can't do these puzzles.

384
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,341
So he starts to get up.

385
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:25,506
Suddenly, he spots the PEZ dispenser
on the coffee table.

386
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:27,845
The PEZ dispenser.

387
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,614
He picks it up, he's staring at it.

388
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,780
It's like he's hypnotized by it.

389
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,722
Then he's telling us this story
about how when he was a kid...

390
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,623
...he was in the car
with his father...

391
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,026
...and his father was trying
to load one of them.

392
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:43,964
-Well, they're hard to load.
-Tell me something I don't know.

393
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:49,264
So as the father's trying to load it,
he loses control of the car...

394
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,671
...crashes into a high school cafeteria.

395
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,401
-Get out.
-Nobody's hurt...

396
00:21:53,578 --> 00:21:56,138
...but PEZ was all over the car.

397
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,146
And the dispenser was destroyed...

398
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,148
...virtually beyond recognition.

399
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,178
-Poor kid.
-So as he's telling the story...

400
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,414
...he starts crying.

401
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:07,283
-What did you do?
-What do you think?

402
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,292
-I gave him my PEZ dispenser.
-Wow.

403
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,431
Two hours later,
he checks into Smither's clinic.

404
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:16,567
Talked to the doctor yesterday.
He's doing great on the rehab...

405
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,135
...he's hooked on PEZ.

406
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,671
He's eating them
like there's no tomorrow.

407
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,540
What's a three-letter word for candy?

408
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:31,080
I can't do those things.

409
00:22:43,095 --> 00:22:46,724
Jawbreakers, to me, was like
the ultimate challenge candy.

410
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:50,265
It was like candy manufacturers were
sitting in their laboratories, going:

411
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:52,562
"l wonder if they'll eat this.

412
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:55,298
This seems pretty tough to eat.

413
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,942
Let's market it
as some sort of experiment."

414
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,601
But the concept of Jawbreakers--
What was the concept?

415
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,407
Multicolored cement balls
for a quarter?

416
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,277
Was that the idea behind it?

417
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,918
"Let's see if we can hurt them.

418
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,055
Let's see if they'll pay to be hurt."

419
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,952
This is the idea behind Jawbreakers.

420
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,717
I did it, I ate them, I loved them.

421
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,689
"Oh, this is very painful.
I'm really hurting.

422
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:22,800
And this is hurting me a lot.
I love them."



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
