1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,311
The bad thing about television...

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,075
...is that everybody you see on
television is doing something better...

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,673
...than what you're doing.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,235
You never see anybody
on TV sliding off the sofa...

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,833
...with crumbs on their face.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,072
Some people have a
little too much fun.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,514
The soda commercial people.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,309
Where do they summon
this enthusiasm?

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,275
Have you seen them? ''We have soda!
We have soda! We have soda!''

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,637
Jumping, laughing,
flying through the air.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,273
lt's a can of soda.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,633
Have you ever been standing there
and you're watching TV...

13
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,439
...and you're drinking
the exact product...

14
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,353
...that they're advertising
right there on TV?

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,832
And it's like, you know, they're spiking
volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis...

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,391
...and l'm standing there, '' Maybe l'm
putting too much ice in mine.''

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,874
So then, as we were leaving...

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,112
...we were just kind of standing there,
and she was smiling at me.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,191
l wasn't sure if she wanted
me to ask her out.

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,271
When women smile,
l don't know what it means.

21
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,476
Sometimes l interpret it like
they're psychotic.

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,835
l don't know if l'm
supposed to smile back.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,831
l just stood there.
Remember Quayle when...

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,719
...Bentsen gave him the Kennedy
line? That's what l looked like.

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,757
-So you didn't ask?
-No. l froze.

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,911
-Counter.
-Oh, yeah. So wait, wait.

27
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,753
Half-hour later l'm back at the office.
l tell Lloyd the story.

28
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,469
He says, ''Why don't you call her?''
l says, '' l can't!'' l couldn't do it then.

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,279
For me to ask a woman out,
l gotta get into a mental state...

30
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,670
...like karate guys
before they break bricks.

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,308
So then Lloyd calls me a wuss.

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,834
-He said ''wuss''?
-Yeah.

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,078
Anyway, he shamed me into it.

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,954
-So you called?
-Right.

35
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,475
And to cover my nervousness,
l started eating an apple.

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,438
l think if they hear you chewing
on the other end of the phone...

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,750
-...makes you sound casual.
-Yeah, like a farm boy.

38
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,797
Right. So l call her up,
l tell her it's me.

39
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,678
She gives me an enthusiastic '' Hi!''

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,149
Enthusiastic hi,
that's beautiful.

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,550
l don't get the enthusiastic hi,
l'm out of there.

42
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,518
So you're chewing your apple.
You got your enthusiastic hi.

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,240
We're talking. l don't go
too long before l ask them out.

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,311
l want to get it over with right away.

45
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,278
So l just blurt out, ''What are
you doing Saturday night?''

46
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,714
And?

47
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,393
She bought.

48
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,953
Great day in the morning.

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,872
Then l got off the phone right away.

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,589
lt's like robbing a bank. Don't loiter in
front of the teller with a bag of money.

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,796
You make your hit and get out.

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,758
We both have dates
on the same night.

53
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,831
l can't remember
the last time that happened.

54
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,115
l can't stand doing laundry, that's
why l have 40 pairs of underwear.

55
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,077
-You do not.
-Absolutely.

56
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,232
Because instead of doing a wash,
l just keep buying underwear.

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,197
My goal is to have over 360 pair.

58
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,920
That way, l only have
to do wash once a year.

59
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,391
Come on, try it!

60
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,630
Let me hear you
try a Scottish accent.

61
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,270
-That's lrish.
-lrish, Scottish.

62
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,590
What's the difference, lassie?

63
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,080
So thanks for dinner.
lt was great.

64
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,509
Yeah.

65
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,719
We should do this again.

66
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,037
Would you like to come
upstairs for coffee?

67
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,319
No, thanks. l can't drink coffee
at night. lt keeps me up.

68
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,919
So....

69
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,308
Okay.

70
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,029
Okay.

71
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,868
Good night.

72
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,359
Yeah. Take it easy.

73
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,670
-Thanks again for the movie.
-You're welcome.

74
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,510
l'd invite you up,
but the place is being painted.

75
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,113
Oh, that's okay.

76
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,235
Unless you want to go to your place.

77
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,313
Okay, but there's no cake or anything,
if that's what you're looking for.

78
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,799
''Take it easy.''

79
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,993
''Take it easy!''

80
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,120
l think if one's going to kill oneself...

81
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,078
...the least you could do is leave
a note. lt's common courtesy.

82
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,434
l don't know.

83
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,909
That's just the way
l was brought up.

84
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,392
-Values are important.
-So important.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,389
What are you doing Thursday night?
You wanna have dinner?

86
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,359
Thursday's great.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,638
Tan pants.

88
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,914
Why do l buy tan pants, Donna?

89
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,718
l don't feel comfortable in them.

90
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,950
Are those cotton Dockers?

91
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,519
l can't begin to tell you how much
l hate that commercial.

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,193
Really?

93
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,316
l like that commercial.

94
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,110
You like that commercial?

95
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,599
Yeah. lt's clever.

96
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,789
You mean the one where the guys
are all standing around...

97
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,757
...supposedly being very
casual and witty?

98
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,956
Yeah. That's the one.

99
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,069
What could you possibly
like about that?

100
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,515
l don't know. l like the guys.

101
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,114
Yeah they're so funny and so
comfortable with each other.

102
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,397
And l could be comfortable too,
if l had pants like that.

103
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,273
l could sit on a porch
and wrestle around...

104
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,829
...and maybe even be
part of a real bull session.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,197
l know guys like that. To me,
the dialogue rings true.

106
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,398
Even if the dialogue did ring true...

107
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,950
...even if somehow, somewhere men
actually talk like that...

108
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,078
...what does that have
anything to do with the pants?

109
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,356
Doesn't that bother you?

110
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,398
That's the idea.
That is what is clever about it.

111
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,393
-They're not talking about pants.
-They're talking about nothing.

112
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,357
-That's the point.
-l know the point.

113
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,272
No one is telling you to like it.

114
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,228
All those quick shots of the pants.
Just pants, pants, pants, pants.

115
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,516
What is that supposed to be?

116
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,590
What's brutal about the date is the
scrutiny you put each other through.

117
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,433
Because whenever you
think about this person...

118
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,388
...in terms of the future, you have
to magnify everything about them.

119
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,792
The guy will be like, '' l don't think
her eyebrows are even.

120
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,749
Could l look at uneven eyebrows
for the rest of my life?''

121
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,115
Of course, the woman's looking
at the guy thinking:

122
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,510
''What is he looking at?

123
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,911
Do l want someone looking at me
like this for the rest of my life?''

124
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,717
l'm supposed to see her
again on Thursday.

125
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,634
But can l go out with someone that
actually likes this commercial?

126
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,557
l once broke up with a guy because
he didn't keep his bathroom clean.

127
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,790
No kidding. Did you tell him
that was the reason?

128
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,393
Yeah. l told him all the time.

129
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,949
You would not have
believed his tub.

130
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,157
Germs were building
a town in there.

131
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,753
They were constructing offices.

132
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,878
Houses near the drain
were going for $1 50,000.

133
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,073
Hi.

134
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,278
You're still thinking about this?

135
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,108
She invites me up at 1 2:00
at night for coffee.

136
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,558
And l don't go up.

137
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,798
'' No, thank you.

138
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,996
l don't want coffee.

139
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,037
lt keeps me up.

140
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,075
Too late for me to drink coffee.''

141
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,278
l said this to her.

142
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,679
People this stupid
shouldn't be allowed to live.

143
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,711
l can't imagine what
she must think of me.

144
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,916
She thinks you're a guy
that doesn't like coffee.

145
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,196
She invited me up!
Coffee's not coffee.

146
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,874
-Coffee is sex.
-Maybe coffee was coffee.

147
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,600
Coffee's coffee in the morning,
not at 1 2:00 at night.

148
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,273
Some people drink coffee that late.

149
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,513
Yeah, people who work at NORAD
who are on 24-hour missile watch.

150
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,314
Everything was going along so great.
She was laughing.

151
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,993
l was funny.

152
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,029
l kept saying to myself, '' Keep it up,
don't blow it. You're doing great.''

153
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,034
lt's all in your head. All she knows
is she had a good time.

154
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,192
-l think you should call her.
-l can't call her now. lt's too soon.

155
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,237
l'm planning a Wednesday call.

156
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,039
Why? l love it when guys
call me the next day.

157
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,714
Of course you do, but you're
imagining a guy you like.

158
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,475
Not a guy who goes, '' No. l don't
drink coffee late at night.''

159
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,276
lf l call her now,
she's gonna think l'm needy.

160
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,919
Women don't want to see need.

161
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,834
They want a take-charge guy,
a colonel, a Kaiser, a czar.

162
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,070
All she'll think is that you like her.

163
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,396
That's exactly what
l'm trying to avoid.

164
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,152
She wants you to like her.

165
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,950
Yes, she wants me to like her, if she
likes me, but she doesn't like me.

166
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,637
l don't know what your parents
did to you.

167
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,079
Hey.

168
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,318
Hey. l just thought of a really
funny thing for your act.

169
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,914
All right. You're up there.
You're on stage, and you go:

170
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,550
''You ever notice
how cars here in New York...

171
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,711
...never get out of the way
of ambulances?

172
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,874
Someone's in a life-and-death
situation, and we're thinking:

173
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,393
'Sorry, buddy.

174
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,518
Should've thought of that when you
were eating cheese omelets...

175
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,353
...for breakfast every morning
for the last 30 years.'''

176
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,553
So you gonna use it?

177
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,519
l don't think so.

178
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,715
-Well, it's funny.
-lt's funny.

179
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,518
l like to do my own material.

180
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,592
That's as good as anything you do.

181
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,553
All right, l gotta make a call.
Everybody out. Come on.

182
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,990
-Why do we have to leave?
-l can't call a woman...

183
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,037
-...with other people in the room.
-Oh, see?

184
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,679
This is the problem.

185
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,639
You're kicking me out of my house?

186
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,313
-Yes.
-Don't forget.

187
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,278
Right. Jerry,
do you have any apples?

188
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,472
Don't do the apples.

189
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,831
lt's enough already with the apples.

190
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,236
Hi, it's Carol. I'll get back to you.

191
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,800
Hi! lt's George.

192
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,916
George Costanza.
Remember me?

193
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,071
The guy who didn't come up
for coffee.

194
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,194
You see, l didn't realize
that coffee didn't really mean....

195
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,792
Well, whatever.

196
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,629
Anyway.

197
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,438
lt was fun.

198
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,837
lt was....

199
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,437
lt was fun, so....

200
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,433
Oh, boy. So....

201
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,828
You call me back.

202
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,116
lf you want.

203
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,157
That's up to you, you know.

204
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,072
Whatever you want to do.

205
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,199
Either way.

206
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,757
The ball's in your court.

207
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,596
So....

208
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,994
Take it easy.

209
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,635
l'm just getting my jacket.
l'll meet you downstairs.

210
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,439
What's the matter?
Did you call?

211
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,999
Got her machine.

212
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,113
l'm dead. l'm a dead man. That's it,
l'm dead. l'm a dead man.

213
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,554
Dead man.

214
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,915
-What'd you say?
-l don't know what the hell l said.

215
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,152
l gave her an ultimatum, and there's
nothing l can do. lt's a machine.

216
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,392
The little light's blinking right now.
'' Come and listen to the idiot.

217
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,120
Hey, everybody, the idiot's on!''

218
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,435
After one date you try and improvise
on a machine?

219
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,750
Now l'm in the worst position of all.

220
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,549
My brother-in-law once left a message
on this guy's machine.

221
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,439
And he blurted out business
information he wasn't supposed to.

222
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,989
lt would have cost him $1 5,000...

223
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,151
...so he waited outside
the guy's house.

224
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,199
When the guy came home, he went
with him and switched the tape.

225
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,278
-He did that?
-Yeah.

226
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,589
Somebody did that?

227
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,797
She'll call you back.
You're overreacting.

228
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,236
-Not once.
-Never?

229
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,394
l have never seen one episode
of I Love Lucy in my life ever.

230
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,199
-That's amazing.
-Thank you.

231
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,833
Anything else l should know?

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,116
Yes. l'm lactose intolerant.

233
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,551
-Really?
-l have no patience for lactose...

234
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,957
...and l won't stand for it.

235
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,358
l'll be right back.

236
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,588
Wait till you hear this.

237
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,912
l'm sorry. l had no idea--

238
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,230
Wait. Wait. He's in the bathroom.

239
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,474
l wanted to talk to him for a minute,
but l'll come back.

240
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,198
You don't have to leave.

241
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,953
-You sure?
-Yes.

242
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,553
Okay.

243
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,036
-l'm Donna.
-Donna.

244
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,873
You're the one that likes
that commercial!

245
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,673
He told you that?

246
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,116
No. He didn't actually tell me that.

247
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,113
We were talking about that
commercial. ln fact...

248
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,795
...l think l brought it up because
l like that commercial. No.

249
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,355
He would never actually tell
me anything like that.

250
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,750
He never discusses anything. He's--

251
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,390
He's like a clam. You're not
gonna mention this to him--?

252
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,075
So you tell your friends l'm not hip
because l like that commercial.

253
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,389
What?

254
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,278
-What did you say?
-Say? What? Nothing.

255
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,874
You told him how l like
the commercial.

256
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,399
So what if l said that?

257
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,232
You didn't have to tell
your friends.

258
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,710
No, l had to tell my friends.
My friends didn't have to tell you.

259
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,678
Why'd you have to
get me in trouble?

260
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,070
l don't like you talking
about me behind my back.

261
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,470
-Oh, boy.
-l said l couldn't believe you liked...

262
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,073
...that commercial. So what?

263
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,073
l asked some friends this weekend,
all of them like the commercial.

264
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,630
Boy, l bet you got a regular
Algonquin Round Table there.

265
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,714
Hey.

266
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,389
Kramer, this is Donna.

267
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,071
-Cotton Dockers!
-Hello.

268
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,798
We should be going. Come on.

269
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,394
-What? Where are we going?
-Don't bother. l'm leaving.

270
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,913
You're making too much of this.

271
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,559
''One hundred percent
cotton Dockers.

272
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,029
lf they're not Dockers,
they're just pants.''

273
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,879
Kramer, please. Donna.

274
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,553
l don't wanna hear it.

275
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,433
l can't believe l said that.

276
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,272
You know me. l'm a vault.

277
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,317
Don't worry,
it wasn't working anyway.

278
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,074
-What happened there?
-l'll tell you later.

279
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,477
You're not gonna believe
what's going on with this woman.

280
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,913
You remember l made
the initial call Sunday.

281
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,354
She doesn't call back.

282
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,953
l call again Monday.

283
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,348
l leave another message.

284
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,670
l call Tuesday,
l get the machine again.

285
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,991
'' l know you're there.
l don't know what your story is.''

286
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,310
Yesterday, l'm a volcano.

287
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,198
l try one more call.

288
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,354
The machine comes on, and l let fly
like Mussolini from the balcony.

289
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,590
''Where the hell
do you get the nerve?

290
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,389
You invite me up for coffee, and then
you don't call me back for four days?

291
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,279
l don't like coffee.
l don't have to come up!

292
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,069
l'd like to get one more shot at the
coffee so l can spit it in your face!''

293
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,875
-You said that?
-l lost it.

294
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,430
l can't blame you. l can't believe
she never called you back.

295
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,159
She did.

296
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,313
Today.

297
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,596
-What?
-She called my office.

298
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,473
She said she's been
in the Hamptons since Sunday.

299
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,710
She didn't know if l was
trying to get in touch.

300
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,235
Her machine broke, and she's
been using her old machine.

301
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,595
And she doesn't have
the beeper for it.

302
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,594
-She didn't get the messages.
-Exactly. But they're on there waiting.

303
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,320
She can't wait to see me,
we're having dinner tonight.

304
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,596
She's supposed to call me
when she gets home.

305
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,796
But what about the messages?

306
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,352
Elaine's thing?

307
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,669
How you gonna get in?

308
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,190
l'll meet her outside the building.

309
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,397
But you know as soon as she gets
in, she's going for that machine.

310
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,838
Unless she goes for the bathroom,
that's my only chance.

311
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,558
Who am l kidding?
l can't do this! l can't do this!

312
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,676
l don't know how to work
the stupid machines.

313
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,196
There's nothing to it. You lift the lid.
lt comes right out.

314
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,271
-You do it for me.
-What?

315
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,556
Come on. lt'll be so much easier.

316
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,157
How are you gonna
get me up there?

317
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,880
l'll tell her l bumped into you.
l'm giving you a ride uptown.

318
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,156
-Who makes the switch?
-You do.

319
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,833
-l do.
-l can't do it.

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,592
l'll keep her busy.

321
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,708
l can't get involved in this.

322
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,079
l think l may be in love
with this woman.

323
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,798
What if she sees me?

324
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,554
You are such a wuss.

325
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,951
-A wuss?
-Yeah.

326
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,919
Did you call me a wuss?

327
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,512
Well, there is traffic.

328
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,872
lt might take her till 8: 1 5.

329
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,077
l got one problem. You're keeping
her busy in the other room.

330
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,391
Now what if she somehow gets
away from you and is coming in?

331
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,278
You have to signal me
that she's coming.

332
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,112
A signal. Right.

333
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,557
Okay. The signal is...

334
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,312
...l'll call out ''Tippy-toe!''

335
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,513
Tippy-toe?

336
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,032
l don't think so.

337
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,714
-You don't like tippy-toe?
-No tippy-toe.

338
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,233
All right.

339
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,799
Okay. l got it.

340
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,349
-l'll sing.
-What song?

341
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,759
'' How Do You Solve
a Problem Like Maria?''

342
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,195
-What is that?
-lt's a lovely song.

343
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,112
Got anything else?

344
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,398
You pick it.

345
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,431
-'' Lemon Tree.''
-Peter, Paul and Mary?

346
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,352
No. Trini Lopez.

347
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,633
Okay.

348
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,234
You got the tape?

349
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,479
Standard.

350
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,756
-Micro.
-How do you feel, confident?

351
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,114
-l feel good.
-Nervous?

352
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,599
Not at all.

353
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,159
Get up, get up. lt's her.

354
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,880
To hell with this! l'm scared.
Walk away. Cancel everything.

355
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,429
Hey, what are you doing here?

356
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,636
l was supposed to call you
when l got home.

357
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,917
l couldn't wait. l was too
anxious to see you.

358
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,594
That's so sweet.

359
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,955
This is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld.

360
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,395
l just bumped into him
around the corner.

361
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,957
lsn't that a coincidence?

362
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,475
The funny thing is,
l see him all the time.

363
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,358
-All the time.
-Nice to meet you.

364
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,714
Hi.

365
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,836
So l'm starving.
Where are we gonna eat?

366
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,639
You know, we could go uptown...

367
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,711
...and that way we can give
Jerry a ride home.

368
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,314
Okay. Let's go. l'm ready.
Where'd you park?

369
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,078
Don't you want to go upstairs first?

370
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,118
No. What for? l'll just give
my bag to the doorman.

371
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,794
You know...

372
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,075
...l really need to use the bathroom.

373
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,632
There's a bathroom in the
coffee shop just next door.

374
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,392
Yes. Yes.

375
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,519
-But l have to make a call, so--
-Well, they have a phone.

376
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,672
l know Jerry.

377
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,557
He has this phobia
about public toilets.

378
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,352
l think we really should go upstairs.

379
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,315
You know, l think l will go upstairs.

380
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,038
l can check my machine.

381
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,519
Right.

382
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,079
Right.

383
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,791
The bathroom's down the hall
to the right.

384
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,234
You know...

385
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,595
...why don't you go first?
You just had a long trip.

386
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,637
No, l'm fine.

387
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,390
You know, it's the damnedest thing.

388
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,359
lt went away.

389
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,559
Well, that's weird.

390
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,429
No, no, that can happen. l've read
about that in medical journals.

391
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,033
lt's a freak thing.

392
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,357
Let me just check my messages
and we'll go.

393
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,512
-Carol, could l talk to you right now?
-Sure.

394
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,752
Please, this is--
This is very important.

395
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,754
Tippy-toe! Tippy-toe!
Lemon tree!

396
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,876
Now l know who you are.
You're a comedian.

397
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,076
l've seen you.
lt's been driving me crazy.

398
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,793
Right. l am.

399
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,952
Carol, that's so rude.

400
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,833
-Please, l'm serious.
-Okay.

401
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,672
Just for a moment,
if you wouldn't mind.

402
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,479
And then we'll talk to Jerry.

403
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,879
Hey, you two, l'm ready to go.

404
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,759
That's what you had to tell me?

405
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,831
Your father wears sneakers
in the pool?

406
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,351
Don't you find that strange?

407
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,112
Yes.

408
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,032
l'll just check my machine,
and we'll go.

409
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,511
No. Nothing here.
Let's go.

410
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,193
l forgot to tell you.

411
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,239
After l talked to you, my neighbour
called, played my messages to me.

412
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,590
Yours were hilarious.
We were both cracking up.

413
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,273
l just love jokes like that.

414
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,038
l love my phone machine.

415
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,033
l wish l was a phone machine.

416
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,631
lf l saw somebody on the street
l didn't want to talk to, l could go:

417
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,268
'' Excuse me. l'm not in right now.

418
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,311
lf you could just leave a message,
l could walk away.''

419
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,959
l also have a cordless phone,
but l don't like that as much.

420
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,190
Because you can't slam down
a cordless phone.

421
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,835
You get mad at somebody
on a real phone:

422
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,355
''You can't talk to me like that.''
Bang. You know.

423
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:04,798
Cordless phone.
''You can't talk to me like that.''

424
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,198
l told him.

425
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,191
