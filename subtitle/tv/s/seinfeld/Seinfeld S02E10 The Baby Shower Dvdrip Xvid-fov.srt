1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Men...

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,300
...flip around the television
more than women, I think.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,500
Men get that remote control
in their hands...

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,600
They don't even know
what they're not watching.

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,100
"Rerun, don't wanna watch it."
"What are you watching?"

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,100
"Don't care." "Who was that?"
"Don't know."

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,900
"Isn't that your father?"
"Doesn't matter, I gotta keep going."

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,500
Women don't do that.
See, now, women...

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,800
...will stop and go, "Well,
let me see what the show is...

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,100
...before I change the channel."

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,400
You see, but men just fly.
Because women...

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,900
You see, women nest,
and men hunt.

13
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,200
That's why we watch TV differently.

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,100
Before there was flipping around,
before there was television...

15
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,300
...kings and emperors
and pharaohs and such...

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,700
...had storytellers that would
tell them stories.

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,100
That was their entertainment.

18
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,000
I always wonder in that era if they
would get 30 storytellers together...

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,000
...so they could still flip around.
Just go:

20
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,400
"Tell me your story.
I don't wanna hear anymore.

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,500
Shut up. Next guy.
What are you talking about?

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,500
Is there a girl in that story?
No? Shut up.

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,500
What have you got?
I don't wanna hear that.

24
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,700
What are you talking about?
Don't wanna hear it.

25
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,300
Now, the whole of you,
get out of here. I'm going to bed."

26
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,300
She's pregnant?

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,500
Leslie is pregnant?
Oh, see, there is no justice.

28
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,200
She's the performance artist, right?

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,300
Yeah, performance artist.
She's a performer, a real trouper.

30
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,100
What's her husband's name again?
Chip?

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,500
Kip?

32
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,000
Skip?

33
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,500
- Todd.
- Todd.

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,700
Oh, yeah.

35
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,600
- He's a Kennedy.
- No, he's not.

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,100
- Come on, he's a third cousin.
- By marriage.

37
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,800
Oh, by marriage, yeah.
We went to the wedding.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,900
Should've heard them talk
about Chappaquiddick.

39
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,600
Tried to blame the whole thing
on bad directions.

40
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:50,300
That woman was unequivocally
the worst date of my life.

41
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,300
Pardon me for setting you up
with a beautiful, intelligent woman.

42
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,300
What, you don't think I can attract
beautiful, intelligent women?

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,200
Thin ice, George, very thin ice.

44
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,500
Maybe for her new performance
piece, she'll give birth on-stage.

45
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,900
She stopped performing.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,800
What a huge blow to the culture.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,200
You believe this guy?
He holds a grudge like Khomeini.

48
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,000
She dragged me down
to that warehouse...

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,300
...on the waterfront in Brooklyn
to see one of her performances.

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,800
Oh, and she's on-stage cooking
dinner for some celebrity?

51
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,500
God.

52
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,900
She's cooking dinner for God.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,900
She's yelling,
and the next thing I know...

54
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,400
...she throws a big can of chocolate
syrup all over my new red shirt.

55
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,800
- It was an accident.
- Oh, yeah, accident, right.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,500
She was aiming at me,
like she was putting out a fire.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,100
So for the rest of the show I'm sitting
there with chocolate all over me.

58
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,700
Flies are landing on me.

59
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm boiling, I'm fantasizing
all the things I'm gonna say to her.

60
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,200
Later, finally, backstage,
when I talk to her...

61
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,300
...l'm like a little grovelling worm:

62
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,600
"What kind of chocolate was that?"

63
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,900
"Do you throw any other foods?"
You know...

64
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,400
He thought he still had a shot.

65
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,900
Then, then, then...

66
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,900
...she leaves with somebody else.

67
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,700
Never even...
Never even said goodbye.

68
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,200
Never called me back.
Never apologized. Nothing.

69
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,100
Like I was dirt.

70
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,200
What ever happened with the shirt?

71
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,500
I still have it.

72
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,500
The collar's okay.
I wear it under sweaters.

73
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,800
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

74
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,000
She asked me to give her
a baby shower.

75
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,700
Asked you?
You're not gonna do that, are you?

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,200
Anyone else, never.
But Leslie...

77
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,000
I have a problem saying no to her.

78
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,200
For some reason,
I seem to want her approval.

79
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,300
Let Maria Shriver
give her a baby shower.

80
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,000
Ask not what I can do for you,
ask what you can do for me.

81
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,300
Ich bin ein sucker.

82
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,800
Would you two stop
with the Kennedys?

83
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,700
Why does everyone make such
a big deal about the Kennedys?

84
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:51,100
I mean, what is this fascination?
Who cares? It's all so boring.

85
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,100
Look, she doesn't deserve
a baby shower.

86
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,700
She deserves a baby monsoon.
She deserves Rosemary's baby.

87
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,100
I do have one teeny
little problem, though.

88
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,900
Never said goodbye.
Never apologized. Nothing.

89
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,700
See, I was gonna give
the shower in my apartment...

90
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,700
- But?
- My roommate has Lyme disease.

91
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,600
Lyme disease? I thought she had
Epstein-Barr syndrome.

92
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,300
She has this in addition
to Epstein-Barr.

93
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,900
It's like Epstein-Barr
with a twist of Lyme disease.

94
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,300
- How'd she get Lyme disease?
- I don't know.

95
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,700
She did some outdoor version of Hair
in Danbury, Connecticut.

96
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,200
- They still do that play?
- It's a classic.

97
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,300
- With the nudity?
- I guess.

98
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,100
She must've rolled over
on a tick during the love-in.

99
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,600
Never said goodbye. Goodbye.

100
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,600
Explain to me how
this baby shower thing works.

101
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,400
What do you want to know?

102
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,100
Well, I mean does it ever erupt
into a drunken orgy of violence?

103
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,100
Rarely.

104
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,800
There's no hazing of the foetus
or anything, is there?

105
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,700
No.

106
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
- When is this supposed to be?
- Saturday.

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,800
Saturday. Well, I have a show
in Buffalo on Saturday.

108
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,000
They're not gonna bust up
my apartment, are they?

109
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,900
No, I'll take full responsibility.

110
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,600
Because I've seen pregnant women...

111
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,100
...and they sometimes
misjudge their foetal girth.

112
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,500
And they'll...

113
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,200
Just, like, one wrong turn, the whole
buffet is, like, right off the table.

114
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,400
Someday, before I die,
mark my words...

115
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,700
...l'm gonna tell that woman
what I think of her.

116
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,600
I'll never be able
to forgive myself until I do.

117
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
- And if you do?
- I still won't forgive myself...

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,300
...but at least it won't be about this.

119
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,200
What are you doing this for?
Look at you.

120
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,100
- Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.
- But you don't have to.

121
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,900
- The guy is waiting in my house.
- Leave me alone.

122
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,400
It's a one-time fee, 150 bucks.

123
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,000
- Why live like this?
- I'm not getting illegal cable.

124
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,300
So you're gonna wait for the cable
companies to resolve their dispute?

125
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,900
They'll be in court for years.

126
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,900
- I read in the paper...
- Oh, the paper...

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,300
- They might hook us up again.
- Oh, God. You're so naive.

128
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,100
All the cable companies care about
is the big "mamoo."

129
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,200
Look at you. You're banging things.
You're just pathetic.

130
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,600
Just wasting your life.

131
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,300
I'm offering you 56 channels.

132
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Movies, sports, nudity,
and it's free for life!

133
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,700
Stop shouting.
You're ruining the reception.

134
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Can you hear yourself?
Can...?

135
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,000
Do you know what you're saying?

136
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,500
- What you're suggesting is illegal.
- It's not illegal.

137
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,500
- It's against the law.
- Well, yeah.

138
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Just hold this.
Can you hold that?

139
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,900
Look, will you at least
let me bring the guy over?

140
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,300
He's an amazing man.
He's a Russian immigrant.

141
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,100
He escaped from the Gulag.

142
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,200
He's like the Sakharov of cable guys.

143
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,700
He'll slow down your gas meter.
He sells slugs, Jerry.

144
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,600
Slugs for the subway.

145
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,400
- He's a real human-rights nut, huh?
- Yeah.

146
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,100
He's intense, man.

147
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't know.

148
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,500
- What if I get caught?
- You're not gonna get caught.

149
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,800
Let me get him in. It's the '90s.
It's Hammer Time. Come on.

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,800
Just let me get him.

151
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,300
Jerry, Jerry,
this is the cable man.

152
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,500
You know, why don't we wait...

153
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,600
...because I'm going
out of town tomorrow...

154
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,600
Tomorrow okay.

155
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,100
No problem. You'll have
the whole thing installed...

156
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,400
...by the time you get back.

157
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,800
No, every time I turn on a TV,
sirens are gonna go off.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,300
They're gonna track me down
like a dog, I know it.

159
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Look, now, Jerry, it's no risk.
I swear.

160
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,700
The Mets have 75 games
on cable this year.

161
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,100
Put it in.

162
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,500
You won't regret it.

163
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,200
Yeah, Jerry's gonna be a cable boy
A cable boy, a cable boy

164
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,700
- Mr. Steinfeld?
- Seinfeld.

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,900
We're with the FBI. You wanna
tell us about your cable hookup?

166
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,500
My cable hookup?
What about it?

167
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,400
It's been illegally installed.

168
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,200
It has? I've been out of town.
How did you know?

169
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,500
Jerry, I had to tell them.
I had to. I had no choice.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,700
They were onto the scam
from the very beginning.

171
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
You're in very serious trouble,
Mr. Steinfeld.

172
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,800
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Hold on. We're just patsies.

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,300
We're just a couple of users.
We never sold the stuff.

174
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,100
What about the Russian guy?
The Russian guy's the guy you want.

175
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,900
Mr. Seinfeld? Agent Stone,
FBI undercover.

176
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,900
No, Jerry!

177
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,800
No!

178
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,800
Cable boy?

179
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,800
Cable boy?

180
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,300
What have you done
to my little cable boy?

181
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,600
Excuse me, could I get
something to drink?

182
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,500
I'm afraid not.

183
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,500
What's with this airline?
You're cutting out the drinks?

184
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,300
No, sir, we're flying into a blizzard.
Please fasten your seat belt.

185
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,100
We're making an emergency landing.

186
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,300
Are they gonna go over
the instructions again?

187
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,800
My name is Bill.

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,600
I might be the last person
you ever see.

189
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm not afraid of flying, although
many people do have fear of flying.

190
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,400
And I have no argument with that.
I think fear of flying...

191
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,900
...is quite rational,
because human beings cannot fly.

192
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,200
Humans have fear of flying,
same way fish have fear of driving.

193
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,500
You put a fish behind the wheel,
and they go, "This isn't right.

194
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,800
I shouldn't be doing this.

195
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,500
I don't belong here."

196
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,900
- Sounds like a rough trip.
- Well...

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,700
...there were fire engines and
ambulances all on the runway.

198
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,400
And then when we landed safely,
they all seemed so disappointed.

199
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,300
So the college cancelled the gig?

200
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
There was so much snow,
the roads were closed.

201
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,900
I really appreciate
you picking me up. Thanks again.

202
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,800
- Forget it.
- No, really, an airport run.

203
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,400
It's nothing.

204
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,200
It's one thing if I asked you,
"Could you do me a favour?"

205
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,600
But to suggest it...

206
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,500
When you told me what
you went through on the plane...

207
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,400
...it makes you stop and think.

208
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,900
I appreciate having a real friend.

209
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,100
If Richie Brandis did this,
I'd be suspicious.

210
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,700
You know how he's always got
some ulterior motive?

211
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Ulterior motive...

212
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,700
Wait a minute. Don't take
the bridge. Get off here.

213
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,300
We can't go back to my place.
Elaine's having the shower.

214
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,200
- What, tonight? Now?
- Yeah. Yeah, I forgot all about it.

215
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,200
No big deal.
We'll go back to your place.

216
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,000
My place? No, no. I hate my place.
I don't wanna go back to my place.

217
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,600
Well, you wanna get a bite?

218
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,000
Well, yeah, I would. It's just that
I just ate a whole pot roast.

219
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,300
Well, so, what should we do?

220
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,100
You know, shouldn't we
at least drop off your bag?

221
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,500
Red shirt! Red shirt!
That's the red shirt!

222
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,500
- What are you talking about?
- You're wearing the chocolate shirt!

223
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
I am. What a strange coincidence.

224
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,100
Nice try, my friend, but you gotta
get up pretty early in the morning.

225
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,600
You gotta let me go over there.

226
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,100
What, you're gonna badger a pregnant
woman at her own baby shower?

227
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,900
You're gonna take it off and
make her rinse it in club soda?

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,900
No. I'm gonna hold it under her nose
so she can smell the scent...

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,500
...of stale Bosco that I had
to live with for three years.

230
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,200
Then I'm gonna say, " Remember
this shirt, baby? Well, now...

231
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,600
...it's payback time!"

232
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,300
We just bought an apartment
on Riverside Drive.

233
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,300
Bernard Goetz's mother
used to live there.

234
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,500
- So where's Todd?
- Up in Hyannisport.

235
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,800
Oh, my God, Hyannisport?
With the Kennedys?

236
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,100
Who else is up there?
Is Rose up there?

237
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,200
- So when's your due date?
- March 20th, 9 a.m.

238
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,100
- You know the time?
- I'm having a planned C-section.

239
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,000
My therapist told me if I go
through labour, I might get psychotic.

240
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Leslie, Leslie, what ever
happened to Sargent Shriver?

241
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,900
Is he still with them? You don't hear
much about him these days.

242
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,900
Is he, like, out of the loop, or...?

243
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Elaine, who catered this, Sears?

244
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,400
What is this?
What are you doing here?

245
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,200
- We're putting in the cable.
- The cable?

246
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,500
No, I'm having a party here.
You can't do this now.

247
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,200
Oh, we have to do this now.

248
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,800
- Who is this guy?
- Which one?

249
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,900
- Both of them.
- They're Soviet cable guys.

250
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,800
Okay. Does Jerry know about this?

251
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,200
Oh, yeah, yeah.
It's all authorized. Yeah.

252
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,500
- You can't. You can't do this now!
- Elaine...

253
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,000
Do you know how booked up
this guy is?

254
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,700
If I send him away now, it's gonna take
Jerry months to get him back.

255
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,000
He won't like that.

256
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,300
All right. Just do it fast,
and then get out.

257
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,800
Anatole? Giddap. Go.

258
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,600
It's only gonna take
a few minutes.

259
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,600
Then you and the gals
can take a load off...

260
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,000
...and watch something on Lifetime.

261
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,700
What if we go up there,
what are you gonna say to her?

262
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,300
- What am I gonna say?
- Yeah.

263
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,100
"What did you go out
with me for?

264
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,300
Just to dump chocolate on my shirt,
and then dump me altogether?

265
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,800
I don't deserve
that kind of treatment.

266
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,300
You don't have the common courtesy
to return my calls? To apologize?

267
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,700
You think I'm some sort of a loser
that likes to be abused and ignored?

268
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,300
Whose shirt can be ruined
without financial restitution?

269
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,500
Some sort of a masochist
who enjoys being humiliated?

270
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,500
You think you can just avoid me
like I have some disease?

271
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,900
You have the disease!
You have the disease!

272
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,700
You may be beautiful and
rich and physically...

273
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,700
...just unbelievable,
but you sicken me.

274
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,200
You disgust me.
You and everyone like you."

275
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,200
- You'll never say that to her face.
- Watch me.

276
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, I eat the whole apple.
Core, stem, seeds, just everything.

277
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,500
Kramer. Kramer, look at him.

278
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,500
- Look. He's eating all the food.
- Yeah, yeah.

279
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,600
Well, you know,
there are many differences...

280
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,700
...between American and Soviet
cultures that you're not aware of.

281
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,500
See, in Russia, the cable guy,
they got the whole run of the house.

282
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Yeah, that's tradition.

283
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,300
You ever eat the bark
off of a pineapple?

284
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
- Kramer! Kramer!
- Excuse me.

285
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,300
Wow, man!

286
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,300
What are you doing here?
I thought you were out of town.

287
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,300
The show was cancelled.
There was a blizzard.

288
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,600
I can't believe you told Kramer
to install cable during the shower.

289
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,500
Jerry, look, look.
They've eaten everything.

290
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,800
Jerry, what a surprise.
I thought you'd left town.

291
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,400
Well, Leslie, sometimes
the road less travelled...

292
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,100
...is less travelled for a reason.

293
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,500
George, don't even think about it.
Don't even dream about it.

294
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,100
- About what?
- Kramer!

295
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,900
Leslie.

296
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,100
Yeah?

297
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,400
George.

298
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,700
George Costanza.

299
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,300
Hi.

300
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,200
I guess you don't remember me...

301
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,800
...but we actually went out
a couple years ago...

302
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,900
...once. Remember?

303
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,500
- Vaguely.
- Yeah.

304
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,500
You took me to see one
of your shows.

305
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,300
And?

306
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
And...

307
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,100
...it was quite good.

308
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,700
In fact, you even incorporated me
into the show.

309
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,600
I'm not actually a performer,
although my parents felt I had talent...

310
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,500
Jerry?

311
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,700
Remember me?

312
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,800
- I'm sorry...
- Mary Contardi. No?

313
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,800
Doesn't ring a bell, Jerry?
We had a date three years ago.

314
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,700
You took me to one of your shows.

315
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,500
- I think I remember.
- Told me you had a great time.

316
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,200
- Said you'd call me the next day.
- I'm sure I meant to call.

317
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,100
- I probably just lost your...
- Liar!

318
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,500
Liar!

319
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,200
You were never going to call me.

320
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,400
You thought you could waltz through
life and never bump into me again.

321
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,900
But you were wrong, Jerry.
You were wrong.

322
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,200
What do you think?
I'm some poor pathetic wretch?

323
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,700
- I didn't think that.
- To be dismissed and ignored.

324
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,300
Some insignificant piece of dust?

325
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,700
Some person who doesn't
deserve respect and attention?

326
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,700
Well, you're the one who doesn't
deserve my respect and attention!

327
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,700
You're the insignificant piece of dust!

328
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,400
Actually, I never had
any formal training.

329
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,700
I guess I'd be better suited
for improvs or something...

330
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,500
Thanks a lot.

331
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
Oh, bye.

332
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,100
- Oh, I'm so sorry you have to go.
- Yeah, I really have to be going.

333
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,600
All right, listen. I've changed my mind.
I don't want the cable.

334
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,100
- Jerry, don't be a fool.
- You don't want?

335
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,900
No, I don't want. Tell me what
I owe you for your trouble...

336
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,600
Four hundred dollars.

337
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,000
Four hundred dollars.

338
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,100
You told me 150.

339
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,600
Oh, well...

340
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,100
I'm going. Obviously.

341
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,100
Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about
everything that went on here tonight.

342
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,500
- I had no idea...
- Elaine...

343
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,000
...I was watching you tonight,
and I realized something.

344
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,700
You're just like you were
in college.

345
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,700
Thank you.

346
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,400
What was I like in college?

347
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,300
Come on, let's go.

348
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,800
Be right back.

349
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,200
I'm not paying $400.
I don't even want the thing.

350
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,400
What are you gonna do?

351
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,600
Every woman on the face
of the earth...

352
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,700
...has complete control of my life...

353
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,100
...and yet I want them all.

354
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,700
Is that irony?

355
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,600
Why can't I meet a Kennedy?

356
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,000
I saw John Jr. once downtown.
I was on a bus.

357
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,700
I hit the...

358
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,500
...ding.

359
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,000
It didn't stop.

360
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,100
All right. I said I had
a good time and I'd call...

361
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,500
...but who takes that literally?

362
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,500
Hey, come on over. Doctor Zhivago's
on cable in five minutes.

363
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,400
I'm making popcorn!

364
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,900
What do you do at the end
of a date when you know...

365
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,400
...you don't want to see this person
ever again for the rest of your life?

366
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,900
What do you say? What do you say?

367
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,500
It doesn't...
No matter what you say, it's a lie.

368
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,300
"I'll see you around.

369
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
See you around.

370
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,100
If you're around and I'm around...

371
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,700
...l'll see you around that area.

372
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,800
You'll be around other people,
you won't be around me...

373
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,400
...but you will be around.

374
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,300
Take care now."

375
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,600
You ever say that to somebody?
"Take care now.

376
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,200
Take care... now.

377
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,900
Because I'm not gonna be
taking care of you...

378
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,300
...so you should take care now."

379
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,100
"Take care, take care."
What does that mean? "Take care."

380
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,200
"Take off." Isn't that what
you really wanna say?

381
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,300
"Take off now.

382
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,800
Get out of here."

383
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,600
