1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,594
Why are people surprised...

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,395
...when someone
gets hit with a golf ball?

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,312
Have you watched
the tournaments on TV?

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,358
You got 600 people
crowding around a hole that big...

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,397
...and no one believes it
when a Titleist...

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,312
...bounces off someone's coconut.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,995
You know, you throw a rock into
a crowd, that's considered terrorism.

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,438
But if you have a nice follow-through,
you know, that's golf.

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,996
I'm always impressed
with the golf cameraman...

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,948
...whose job it is to follow the golf ball
when it's in the sky.

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,237
It's a little white ball doing 100 miles
an hour on a white background.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,595
"I got it. I lost it. I got it. I lost it."

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,320
Why bother? Aim the camera
at the sky. Aim it at the ground.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,391
Take a ball out of your pocket.
Throw it down.

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,755
Who's gonna know
where the hell it came from?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,752
How did you lock your keys
in your car?

17
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,512
How? Because I'm an idiot.

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,996
- Why didn't you get a locksmith?
- I was going to.

19
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,709
Then I found out the Auto Club has
free locksmith service, so I signed up.

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,440
Just waiting
for the membership to kick in.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,678
How long has your car been sitting
in the Yankee parking lot?

22
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,429
I don't know. About three days.

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,958
Hello, boys.

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,869
- You're not playing golf?
- Yes, indeed.

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,873
Calendar says winter,
but the gods of spring are out.

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,873
- And the course is open?
- No, no.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,390
I sneak in with Stan the Caddy.
We go through the caddies' entrance.

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,312
- No kidding.
- I'll tell you something else.

29
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,075
Stan's advice has transformed
my game. He's never wrong.

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,518
He thinks eventually I'll have a shot
at making it big on the Senior Tour.

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,999
Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.

32
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,119
- Really, you're getting that good?
- Oh, I'm the real deal.

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,037
Yeah, here, Stan. In here.
There he is.

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,760
Jerry, George, this is Stan the Caddy.

35
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,319
- How you doing?
- Hi.

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,469
Nice to meet you.

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,312
- Ready to hit the links?
- You betcha.

38
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,273
- What are those, cotton pants?
- Yeah, yeah.

39
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,634
What, is it too cold out?

40
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,029
Here's what you do.
You bring a lightweight jacket.

41
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,112
That way, the sun comes out,
you play the jacket off the sweater.

42
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,158
Oh, that makes sense.
That's a good call, Stan.

43
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,753
All right. We'll see you later.

44
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,911
- Yeah, we'll see you.
- See you.

45
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,916
- Stan the Caddy.
- Stan the Caddy.

46
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,989
Elaine?

47
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,959
Hi.

48
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,749
Oh, great. It's the braless wonder.

49
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,592
Who does she think she's kidding?

50
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,274
Look at her,
she's totally out of control.

51
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,113
I was thinking, "That woman
looks like Elaine Benes."

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,748
Yeah. What have you been up to?

53
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,559
- Just been hanging out.
- I see.

54
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,950
Listen, I'm having a birthday party
tomorrow evening.

55
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,588
- I'd love it if you came by.
- Oh, tomorrow.

56
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,398
- I don't know if I can.
- No?

57
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,395
- No, I'm just really, really busy.
- Oh, that's too bad.

58
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,471
Well, I hope you can
get me a gift anyway.

59
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,237
- George.
- Mr. Wilhelm.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,434
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but Mr. Steinbrenner and I...

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,637
...want you to know we appreciate
all the hours you've been putting in.

62
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,836
Oh, and confidentially...

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,675
...Sozonkel, assistant to the general
manager, hasn't been working out...

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,149
...and the boss thinks
you're the man for the job.

65
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,754
So keep it under your hat.

66
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,672
Assistant to the general manager!
Do you know what that means?

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,070
He could be asking my advice
on trades.

68
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,470
Trades, Jerry. I'm a heartbeat away.

69
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,068
That's a hell of an organization
they're running up there.

70
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:40,230
I can't understand why they haven't
won a pennant in 15 years.

71
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,834
And it is all because of that car.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,833
See, Steinbrenner is, like,
the first guy in at the crack of dawn.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,594
He sees my car.
He figures I'm the first guy in.

74
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,558
Then the last person to leave
is Wilhelm.

75
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,473
He sees my car. He figures
I'm burning the midnight oil.

76
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,438
Between the two of them, they
think I'm working an 18-hour day.

77
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,795
Locking your keys in your car is
the best career move you ever made.

78
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,238
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

79
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,755
- Better now.
- Yeah? What happened?

80
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,514
- You know Sue Ellen Mischke?
- Sue Ellen Mischke?

81
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,671
Yeah, the woman I grew up with
in Maryland.

82
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,070
- She moved here last year.
- Sounds familiar.

83
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,800
The heiress to the
Oh Henry! candy-bar fortune?

84
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,428
- You mentioned her.
- Yes. I ran into her today.

85
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,430
This woman has never, not once ever,
as long as I have known her...

86
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,318
...worn a bra.

87
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,040
- That is shameless.
- Well, she's disgusting. She's a pig.

88
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,430
- There's no reason. That's wrong.
- The woman's a pig.

89
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,556
- It's rude.
- All right. There's no point.

90
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,632
- Come on. Come on. We're sorry.
- We're only kidding.

91
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,109
You don't understand.
See, she hasn't changed at all.

92
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,874
She stole my boyfriend
when I was in high school.

93
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,679
I was at this party, and I was
dating this really cute guy.

94
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,512
His name was
Tom Cosley, by the way.

95
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,478
And she goes walking by
in this little floozy outfit...

96
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,710
...and he follows her
right out the door.

97
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,156
She's your Lex Luthor.

98
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,237
Her birthday's coming up, see?
So I decided to get her a little present.

99
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,960
- What are you gonna get her?
- A very traditional...

100
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,111
...a very supportive...

101
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,998
...brassiere.

102
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,554
- There's nothing subtle about that.
- No, no, she might just think it's a gift.

103
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,439
Have I ever bought you
a jockstrap as a gift?

104
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,158
Hey.

105
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,268
What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

106
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,749
I'm thinking of leaving town
with Susan for a few days.

107
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,273
Her parents rebuilt the cabin.

108
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,273
So you're just taking off from work?

109
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,591
Yeah, well, they won't know.
I got the car there.

110
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,591
Is this a good idea, with you being
on the verge of this big promotion?

111
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,230
My presence in that office
can only hurt my chances.

112
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,034
Sue Ellen Mischk e to see you.

113
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,475
Sue Ellen Mischke?

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,195
All right. Send her in.

115
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,991
Hi, Elaine.

116
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,918
Hello.

117
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,308
I was in the neighbourhood...

118
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,552
...so I thought I'd stop in
and thank you for your lovely gift.

119
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,239
Oh, you're welcome.

120
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,231
Is anything wrong?

121
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,074
Well, Sue Ellen, it's...

122
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,515
It's not a top.

123
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,033
It's a bra.

124
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,874
Oh, I know.

125
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,110
Thanks again.

126
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,989
This is the life, isn't it, huh, kid?

127
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,072
- You wanna check out a swap meet?
- Yeah, maybe.

128
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,435
- Where'd you get that?
- It was on the windshield...

129
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,068
...when we came out
of that rest stop.

130
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,632
- Hello.
- Hey, hey, it's George.

131
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,438
- I need a favour.
- What's going on?

132
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,353
I just remembered. There's a
restaurant near Yankee stadium...

133
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,670
...that puts fliers on all the cars.
- Yeah, so?

134
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,515
This is what you gotta do. Go to the
parking lot, take the fliers off my car.

135
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,319
Last time you had me throwing
bread up three floors to you.

136
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,072
Now you want me
to go to the Bronx...

137
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,549
...take fliers off your car.
Where does it end?

138
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,872
All right, fine. I'll drive the three hours
each way and take them off myself.

139
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,156
All right. I'll do it.

140
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,193
- Hey, what are you up to?
- Nothing.

141
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,794
You wanna go to the Bronx
and see if there's fliers...

142
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,552
...on George's car?
- Sure.

143
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,279
- I could have said just about anything.
- Yeah.

144
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,831
Oh, man, look at this mess.

145
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,991
You know what will happen
if they see this?

146
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,388
What are we gonna do?

147
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,869
- I don't know.
- Well, we gotta get it washed.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,355
Oh, the keys are locked inside.

149
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,318
Wait a second.

150
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,155
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll just snag the lock with this.

151
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,596
There we go.

152
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,715
This is quite a life I lead here.

153
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,392
- George has to be happy about this.
- Yeah, yeah.

154
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,429
Oh, my God, Kramer,
is that woman just wearing a bra?

155
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,797
Oh, mama.

156
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,679
Kramer!

157
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,552
My God, are you okay?

158
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,790
I got a cut on my head
and I banged my shoulder.

159
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,475
I guess I have to bring his car back up
to the stadium. If it can make it.

160
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,200
- So how did this happen?
- He was staring at some woman.

161
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,828
Well, I couldn't help it.
You saw what she was wearing.

162
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,557
- What woman?
- There was a beautiful woman...

163
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,631
...walking down the street
wearing just a bra.

164
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,950
I can't get that image
out of my mind.

165
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,754
- Oh, my God.
- What?

166
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,912
- Was it a tall woman in a black blazer?
- Yeah.

167
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,154
- That's Sue Ellen Mischke.
- Sue Ellen Mischke?

168
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,359
That's the bra I gave her.
She's wearing it as a top.

169
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,157
A woman is walking around in broad
daylight with nothing but a bra on.

170
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,959
She's a menace to society.

171
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,875
Hey, you know, my arm really hurts.

172
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,390
I wonder if it's gonna affect
my golf swing.

173
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,876
I got your message.
How's the shoulder?

174
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,510
- It's my left arm. I can't swing it.
- Oh, no, not the left arm!

175
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,557
What happens if I can't play
like I was?

176
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,029
What about the tour
and all my dreams?

177
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,799
I got it!

178
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,518
Let's sue her.

179
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,240
- Sue her?
- Yeah, she's loaded.

180
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,675
She's the heiress to the
Oh Henry! candy-bar fortune.

181
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,195
I can't. I learned my lesson
from that coffee company.

182
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,998
Kramer, listen to me.

183
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,594
Listen. This is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

184
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,113
Your dreams have been shattered.

185
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,271
Somebody's gotta be
held accountable.

186
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,796
Come on. We'll take her
for every penny she's got.

187
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,830
What do you think, Stan?

188
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,995
Let's go for the green.

189
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,272
You know a good lawyer?

190
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,354
So you're driving in the car.

191
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,114
You're with your friend,
minding your own business.

192
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,032
- Then what happened?
- We saw this woman...

193
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,270
...and she was wearing a bra
with no top.

194
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,396
No top? She didn't have a top on?

195
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,916
Yeah, so I got distracted
and I crashed the car.

196
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,559
How would you describe
this woman?

197
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,278
Would you say she was attractive?

198
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,149
- Oh, yeah.
- So we got an attractive woman...

199
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,198
...wearing a bra, no top,
walking around in broad daylight.

200
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,952
She's flouting society's conventions.

201
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,509
- She was flouting.
- That's totally inappropriate.

202
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,195
It's lewd, lascivious, salacious,
outrageous.

203
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,679
It was outrageous.

204
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,513
And she's the heir to
the Oh Henry! candy-bar fortune.

205
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,031
Could you repeat that?

206
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,112
I said, she's the heir to
the Oh Henry! candy-bar fortune.

207
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,952
Oh Henry!?

208
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,356
That's one of our
top-selling candy bars.

209
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,909
It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat.

210
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,958
It's delicious, scrumptious,
outstanding.

211
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,350
- Have you been to a doctor?
- No.

212
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,593
Suzy, call Dr. Bison.
Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer.

213
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,955
Tell him it's for me.

214
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,029
So, what do you think, Jackie?
I mean, we got a case?

215
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,953
Like taking candy from a baby.

216
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,152
I think I got it. How about this?

217
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,390
We trade Jim Leyritz
and Bernie Williams...

218
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,391
...for Barry Bonds.
What do you think?

219
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,755
Then I have Griffey and
Bonds in the same outfield.

220
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,319
Now you got a team.

221
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,392
I don't know, George.
I'm still worried about this car thing.

222
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,393
- Would you stop worrying?
- Well, what about the fliers?

223
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,350
Jerry took the fliers off the car.
I got the whole thing covered.

224
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,553
Come in.

225
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,399
- Wilhelm.
- Mr. Steinbrenner...

226
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,790
...I am very concerned about
George Costanza.

227
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,520
- How about a "good morning"?
- Yes, sir. Good morning, sir.

228
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,669
Good morning, Wilhelm.

229
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:56,355
Anyway, his car is in the parking lot,
the front end is bashed in...

230
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,239
...and there's blood in the car,
and we can't find him anywhere.

231
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,312
Obviously, he was in some sort of
a terrible car accident...

232
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,597
...and trouper that he is,
he tried to make it into work, sir.

233
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,830
Wilhelm, listen to me.
I want the stadium scoured.

234
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,558
He could be bleeding in the bullpen.

235
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,314
Everyone on alert.
Check hospitals, clinics, shelters.

236
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,198
- We've gotta find that kid.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,918
- We must find George.
- Yes, sir.

238
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,071
- Find him, Wilhelm.
- Yes, sir.

239
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,829
Excuse me. Do you know
the gentleman across the hall?

240
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,033
Yes. Yes, I do.

241
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,272
Do you know if he'll
be back anytime soon?

242
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,115
No, I don't.

243
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,675
Is there something
I can help you with?

244
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,115
No, I really just needed
to speak with him.

245
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,830
Well, you can wait for him in here
if you like.

246
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,909
Well, maybe I will.

247
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,310
- lf you don't mind.
- No, no, not at all.

248
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,391
- Thanks.
- I'm Jerry Seinfeld.

249
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,992
What is with these people?
All day long. Come in. Come in.

250
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,509
Mr. Steinbrenner, you know,
we've searched everywhere.

251
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,033
There's no sign of him.

252
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,476
Not even anyone who
remotely fits his description, sir.

253
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,198
Oh, my God.

254
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,351
- Do you know what this means?
- What, sir?

255
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,159
He's dead. Costanza's dead.

256
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,073
- No, no, sir. You see...
- As quickly as he came, he's gone.

257
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,435
The poor little guy.

258
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,830
Easy, Big Stein, get it together.

259
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,228
- Okay, Wilhelm.
- Yes, sir.

260
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,358
Find out where his parents live.
I'm gonna personally notify them.

261
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,671
And line up some candidates
to fill that assistant position.

262
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,398
- Yes, sir.
- We can't grieve forever.

263
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,834
Gotta get back to business.

264
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,275
- Back to business, Wilhelm.
- Yes, sir.

265
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,155
Well, buddy, he's taking the case.

266
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,199
Jackie Chiles is right on it.
Right on it. He's all over it.

267
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,473
- Oh, really?
- Why? What's wrong? Come on.

268
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,359
I don't know. So the woman was
walking around in a bra.

269
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,954
I mean, it's no big deal.
You're still driving.

270
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,190
You should have been
watching the road.

271
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,430
Well, your attitude
has certainly changed.

272
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,113
I don't think it's changed.

273
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,872
Listen, I'm gonna need you
to testify.

274
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,793
- I don't know if I can.
- Jerry, you gotta testify.

275
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,393
- Kramer, I don't think l...
- Listen.

276
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,792
This is a million dollars we're talking
about, Jerry. This is the big league.

277
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,795
- I need you on my team, Jerry.
- Well, I'm not sure how I feel about it.

278
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,389
All right, what's gotten into you?
What's happened?

279
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,715
Nothing's happened.

280
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,999
What's this?

281
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,039
- No, wait a second. Wait a second.
- Oh, I see. Yes.

282
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,112
Little Miss Candy Bar
paid a visit, didn't she?

283
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,716
- Kramer, it is not what you think.
- I know what I think.

284
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,519
I think you're gaga over this dame.

285
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,910
She's twisted you around
her little finger...

286
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,992
...and now you're willing to sell
me and Elaine...

287
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,833
...and whoever else you have to
right down the river.

288
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,399
And what about you?

289
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,279
Trying to bilk an innocent bystander
out of a family fortune...

290
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,830
...built on sweat and toil manufacturing
quality Oh Henry! candy bars...

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,878
...for honest, hardworking Americans.
- You're just out for sex!

292
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,268
You're just out for money!

293
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,556
- Mrs. Costanza?
- Yes.

294
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,994
My name is George Steinbrenner.

295
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,197
I'm afraid I have some very sad news
about your son.

296
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,951
I can't believe it. He was so young.
How could this have happened?

297
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,519
He'd been logging heavy hours.

298
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,831
First one in, last one to leave.
The kid was a human dynamo.

299
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,719
Are you sure you're talking
about George?

300
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,313
You are Mr. and Mrs. Costanza?

301
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,268
What the hell did you
trade Jay Buhner for?

302
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,955
He had 30 home runs
and over 100 RBls last year.

303
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,872
He's got a rocket for an arm.

304
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,554
You don't know what the hell
you're doing!

305
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,870
Buhner was a good prospect.
No question about it.

306
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,996
But my baseball people
loved Ken Phelps' bat.

307
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,593
They kept saying, "Ken Phelps."

308
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,718
I'm not here. Leave a message.

309
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,313
Jerry, it's Frank Costanza.

310
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,115
Mr. Steinbrenner's here.
George is dead. Call me back.

311
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,677
- Hello?
- Hey, it's George.

312
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,398
- Where have you been?
- What?

313
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,551
I just got a bizarre message
from your father.

314
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,950
Steinbrenner's at your house.
They think you're dead.

315
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,509
- Dead?
- And we had an accident with the car.

316
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,716
It's a little crumpled.

317
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,711
- My car's a little crumpled?
- Yeah, yeah.

318
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,394
I didn't know what to do,
so I put it back at the stadium.

319
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,119
Wait a second. Wait a second.

320
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,193
They saw the car and the blood, that's
why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead.

321
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,511
I gotta head back right away.
I gotta figure something out here.

322
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,638
- You gotta call your parents.
- I can't. Steinbrenner might be there.

323
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,268
Aren't you gonna tell your parents
you're still alive?

324
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,475
They could use the break.

325
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,235
Elaine, do you see this?

326
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,111
Do you see what I'm holding
in my hands?

327
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,038
Yeah, it's a bra.

328
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,713
I saw a woman in our hallway
wearing one of these as a top.

329
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,472
What exquisite beauty.

330
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,676
I ran down the hallway
to talk to her...

331
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,150
...but the elevator door closed.
It was not to be.

332
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,390
Perhaps our paths
will cross again someday.

333
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,873
What is this all about?

334
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,510
I want to market this item as
a new direction in women's fashion.

335
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,990
We're gonna sell this as a top.

336
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,993
Here's the angle. Zelda Fitzgerald...

337
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,354
...somebody of the '20s...

338
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,354
...wearing this at wild parties,
driving all the men crazy.

339
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,035
Have it on my desk
by the end of the week.

340
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,192
Come in. Come in.

341
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,274
Mr. Steinbrenner.

342
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,588
Is it you?

343
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,390
Yeah, it's me, sir.

344
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,835
It's been a harrowing few days.

345
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,629
After the car accident,
I crawled into a ditch.

346
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,438
I managed to survive...

347
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,151
...on grubs and puddle water until a
kindly old gentleman picked me up.

348
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,039
Grubs, huh? Gotta admit,
I never tasted one of those.

349
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,838
Anyway, as I was lying
in the puddle...

350
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,912
...I think I may have found a way
for us to get Bonds and Griffey...

351
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,672
...and we wouldn't
give up that much.

352
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,116
Don't tell it to me. Tell it to the
new assistant to the general manager.

353
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,679
I didn't get the job?

354
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,957
You were dead. We couldn't sit on
our hands. We had to make a move.

355
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,878
But you still have your old job.

356
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,156
Of course we'll have to
dock the time you missed.

357
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,594
We're running a ball club.

358
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,196
If I give special treatment to you,
everyone will want it. Next, it's chaos.

359
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,557
And I can tell you this: Chaos does
not work for the New York Yankees.

360
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,756
Not as long
as I'm running the show!

361
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,198
So it was the meeting on the street
that prompted you to buy the bra.

362
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,079
- Would you say that was correct?
- Yes.

363
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,912
Yes. That's correct.

364
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,549
And you have also brought with you
another bra...

365
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,798
...exactly like the one that she
so flagrantly exhibited herself in?

366
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,873
Yes, that's correct.

367
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,270
What was your golf score
the last round you played...

368
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,000
...before your shoulder was injured?
- Three under par.

369
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,037
Three under par.

370
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,390
That's what the professionals shoot,
isn't it?

371
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,198
Well, if they're lucky.

372
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,268
Would you tell this jury...

373
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,750
...exactly what you saw at the corner
of 83rd Street and Columbus?

374
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,230
I don't remember.

375
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,279
Did you or did you not see
the defendant wearing the bra?

376
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,999
I don't know. Maybe.

377
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,594
Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you
that you are under oath.

378
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,193
Now, I ask you again.

379
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,158
Did you or did you not
see this woman wearing a bra?

380
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,389
All right, I saw her. I saw her.

381
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,468
And she was beautiful in that bra.
I'm crazy about her.

382
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,677
I love her whole free-swinging,
freewheeling attitude.

383
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,159
This court will come to order.

384
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,596
- No further questions, Your Honour.
- You may step down.

385
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,751
Well, Kramer,
I think we got this wrapped up.

386
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,478
Yeah, yeah.

387
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,437
What's your read, Stan?

388
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,160
You're close. You're on the green.

389
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,039
You just have to go for the cup.

390
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,589
- What do you mean?
- Have her try on the bra.

391
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,069
- See if it fits.
- No, no, no, no.

392
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,674
Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.

393
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,513
- Stan? Who the hell is Stan?
- He's my caddy.

394
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,353
Your caddy? This is a big mistake.

395
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,758
Your Honour...

396
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,038
...we request at this time
that Miss Mischke try on the bra.

397
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,155
This court will come to order.

398
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,390
Go ahead, Miss Mischke, try it on.

399
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,836
It doesn't fit. I can't put it on.

400
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,035
You damn fools! Look at that.
We got nothing now. Nothing.

401
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,033
I've been practicing law for 25 years,
you're listening to a caddy.

402
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,679
This is a public humiliation.

403
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,479
You can't let the defendant
control the key piece of evidence.

404
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,076
Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard.
Of course it won't fit over a leotard.

405
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,597
A bra's gotta fit right up against
a person's skin. Like a glove!

406
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,320
Hey, Elaine. How about some lunch?

407
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,191
No, I don't think so.

408
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,557
Great job on the Gatsby Swing Top.
It's a winner.

409
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,278
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

410
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,510
Sure you don't wanna go?
We have reservations.

411
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,114
Oh, I don't think you'll have
any trouble getting a table.

412
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,150
- Ciao.
- Bye-bye.
