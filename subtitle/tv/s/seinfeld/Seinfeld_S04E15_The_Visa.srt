1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,201
The age-gap hiring policy
at movie theaters:

2
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:09,473
They never hire anyone
between the ages of 15 and 80.

3
00:00:09,649 --> 00:00:12,675
Know what I mean? The girl
that sells you the tickets, she's 10.

4
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:15,844
Then there's the guy that rips it,
he's 102.

5
00:00:16,022 --> 00:00:18,354
What happened in the middle?
Couldn't find anybody?

6
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:21,823
It's like they want to show you
how life comes full circle.

7
00:00:22,194 --> 00:00:24,424
You're 15. You're selling tickets.
Then you leave.

8
00:00:24,597 --> 00:00:27,657
You go out, you have a family, kids,
marriage, career, grandchildren.

9
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:30,028
Eighty years later, you're back
at the same theater...

10
00:00:30,202 --> 00:00:31,999
...3 feet away, ripping tickets.

11
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:34,901
Took you 80 years
to move 3 feet.

12
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:41,711
The show's delayed? Why?

13
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:44,315
I don't know. Diane told me
to hold it for 15 minutes.

14
00:00:44,483 --> 00:00:45,973
But I got this all timed out.

15
00:00:46,152 --> 00:00:49,121
I got another spot across town at 9:50.
I'm not gonna make it.

16
00:00:49,288 --> 00:00:51,483
- I hear you, guy.
- And I'm doing Letterman Monday.

17
00:00:51,657 --> 00:00:53,750
You know, I gotta work out
the material.

18
00:00:53,926 --> 00:00:56,053
Let me see what I can do.

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,193
Oh, no, Buckles? You're not putting
him on tonight, are you?

20
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:04,302
No. He hangs around in case
somebody drops out.

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,439
Look, why don't you come back
and do the 11:00 spot.

22
00:01:07,606 --> 00:01:11,565
I was supposed to meet my friends
to see this movie Checkmate at 10:30.

23
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:15,742
All right, forget the movie.
I'll do the 11:00 spot. I'll be back.

24
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:18,281
- Hey, Jer.
- Hey.

25
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:28,893
Excuse me. Do you have a ticket?

26
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:31,689
- No.
- Okay. Good.

27
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,500
You missed your spot. It was 9:15.

28
00:01:36,669 --> 00:01:39,137
But, Maurice, I'm positive
you told me 9:50.

29
00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:42,900
In any event, I had no alternative
but to reassign your spot...

30
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:46,977
...to one of your peers who possesses
a clearer understanding...

31
00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:49,740
...of our scheduling policies.

32
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:54,609
- Jerry!
- What are you doing here?

33
00:01:54,787 --> 00:01:56,516
Hey, do you think this is funny?

34
00:01:56,956 --> 00:01:58,856
Why do they call it "athlete's foot"?

35
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:00,855
You don't have to be
an athlete to get it.

36
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:05,520
I mean, my father gets it all the time
and, believe me, he's no athlete.

37
00:02:05,698 --> 00:02:06,824
- I gotta go.
- Wait. Where?

38
00:02:06,999 --> 00:02:08,864
- The movies.
- I thought you told Kernis...

39
00:02:09,034 --> 00:02:10,763
...you were going back
to do the 11:00.

40
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:13,530
I'm just gonna stop by
and tell my friends I can't make it.

41
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:16,766
- Cool. I'll split a cab with you.
- I could be a while over there.

42
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:20,776
I got time. It'll give us a chance to
get to know each other a little better.

43
00:02:26,552 --> 00:02:27,780
- Hey.
- Hey.

44
00:02:29,255 --> 00:02:31,314
- Where is everybody?
- Everybody's late.

45
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,390
Because they know
I'll get in line early.

46
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:36,255
I've been dying to see Checkmate.

47
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:39,158
Well, if it's as good as
Ponce de León, I'll be happy.

48
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:43,461
Ponce de León? Are you kidding me?
I hated that movie.

49
00:02:43,636 --> 00:02:46,036
Ponce de León?
But that was great.

50
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:47,729
Oh, come on.

51
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:49,772
That fountain of youth scene
at the end...

52
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:51,534
...where they're splashing around...

53
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,770
...and they go running over to the
mirror to see if it really worked.

54
00:02:54,947 --> 00:02:56,812
I mean, come on.

55
00:02:57,883 --> 00:02:59,373
It's so stupid.

56
00:02:59,552 --> 00:03:01,076
Let me tell you something:

57
00:03:01,253 --> 00:03:04,381
When Ponce looked in that mirror
and saw that he hadn't changed...

58
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:08,584
...and that tear started to roll
down his cheek, I lost it.

59
00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:10,592
- Oh, there you are.
- Where have you been?

60
00:03:10,763 --> 00:03:12,856
Around the corner
at the Paradise Twin.

61
00:03:13,032 --> 00:03:16,024
- Well, I told you the Paragon.
- No, you said Paradise.

62
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:19,433
- It's playing there too, you know.
- No. I would not have said Paradise.

63
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:22,506
That's a twin theater. I want to see
this movie on a big screen.

64
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:24,370
I'm gonna get a hot dog
at Papaya King.

65
00:03:24,543 --> 00:03:27,512
- You'll never make it back in time.
- I haven't had any dinner.

66
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,341
You can get a hot dog
at the theater.

67
00:03:29,515 --> 00:03:32,006
I don't want a movie dog.
I want a Papaya King hot dog.

68
00:03:32,184 --> 00:03:34,118
Kramer, Jerry is gonna
be here any second.

69
00:03:34,286 --> 00:03:37,778
Then this line's gonna start moving,
and we'll end up in the front row.

70
00:03:37,957 --> 00:03:40,323
- Just save me a seat.
- No, I don't wanna save seats.

71
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:41,754
Don't put me through that.

72
00:03:41,927 --> 00:03:44,327
I once had the fleece ripped out
of my winter coat...

73
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:46,054
...in a seat-saving incident.

74
00:03:46,232 --> 00:03:48,700
- Give me my ticket, then.
- Well, I don't have them yet.

75
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:51,102
You don't have them yet?

76
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,897
Well, I'm in line to buy.

77
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:55,870
No, George,
this is a ticket-holders' line.

78
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,271
No, it's not.
It's the ticket-buyers' line.

79
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:00,639
- Then how come we're not moving?
- Good question.

80
00:04:02,047 --> 00:04:05,039
Is this the ticket-holders' line
or the buyers'?

81
00:04:05,517 --> 00:04:06,950
Holders'.

82
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:09,883
When I asked you before
if you had a ticket, you said no.

83
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:12,819
I didn't. My friend was getting it.

84
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,889
That's good.
It's good to be accurate.

85
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:17,722
Stay here. I'll go get tickets.

86
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:19,959
- Can you believe him?
- He spaced out.

87
00:04:21,467 --> 00:04:24,368
And how long would you have stood
in the ticket-holders' line?

88
00:04:24,937 --> 00:04:26,063
Yeah, exactly.

89
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:28,606
It's sold out.

90
00:04:28,774 --> 00:04:31,902
Oh, real good, George.
Real good.

91
00:04:32,077 --> 00:04:33,942
Hey, I asked the guy
if he had a ticket.

92
00:04:34,113 --> 00:04:36,513
- All right, what time is it?
- Twenty after 10.

93
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:38,775
They got one at the
Paradise at 10:45.

94
00:04:38,951 --> 00:04:42,216
No, I don't wanna go to
a miniplex multi-theater.

95
00:04:42,388 --> 00:04:44,686
It's the same movie.
What's the difference?

96
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:46,154
No, it's not a theater.

97
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:50,989
It's a room where they bring in POWs
to show them propaganda films.

98
00:04:51,931 --> 00:04:53,262
All right, I'm going.

99
00:04:53,432 --> 00:04:54,660
It's in Dolby.

100
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,767
Well, what about Jerry?

101
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:58,801
You go get the tickets.
I'll wait for him.

102
00:04:58,971 --> 00:05:01,462
- Terrific. All right, come on.
- All right.

103
00:05:09,214 --> 00:05:11,739
So then, when I was 12,
the whole family moved...

104
00:05:11,917 --> 00:05:14,909
...from Bensonhurst
to Sheepshead Bay.

105
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:17,148
We were right on the water.

106
00:05:17,323 --> 00:05:20,656
The whole atmosphere
stunk from fish.

107
00:05:20,826 --> 00:05:23,124
You know that fishy smell
I'm talking about?

108
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:25,229
Yeah, yeah. The fishy smell.

109
00:05:25,397 --> 00:05:27,058
To this day I won't eat fish.

110
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:30,724
- Do you eat fish?
- Yes! Yes, I eat fish!

111
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:33,303
- I don't know how you eat that crap.
- Take the Park.

112
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:35,030
No, no, take 55th.

113
00:05:35,207 --> 00:05:36,765
No, there's beautiful homes there.

114
00:05:36,942 --> 00:05:39,809
There's lovely, talented,
attractive people.

115
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:41,207
You'll thank me.

116
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,712
Jerry, I want you to do me a favor:

117
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:45,247
No more fish.

118
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:47,552
Okay. I get your point.

119
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:49,014
I have a point?

120
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:54,852
- Got them.
- Beautiful.

121
00:05:55,027 --> 00:05:57,018
Hey, you know what else
is playing here?

122
00:05:57,196 --> 00:05:58,823
Rochelle Rochelle.

123
00:05:58,998 --> 00:06:00,625
- I wouldn't mind seeing that.
- Yeah.

124
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:03,290
Men can sit through the most
pointless, boring movie...

125
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:07,166
...if there's the slightest possibility
that a woman will take her top off.

126
00:06:08,474 --> 00:06:09,998
So, what's your point?

127
00:06:11,176 --> 00:06:12,666
By the way, you owe me $ 7.50.

128
00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:16,341
- All right. Can you break a 20?
- No. I don't have any change.

129
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:18,515
Well, then I'll pay you later.

130
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:21,442
Or I could take the 20,
and I could pay you later.

131
00:06:22,054 --> 00:06:23,351
Yeah, you could.

132
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:25,253
Might be easier.

133
00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:28,683
Well, how's that easier? I mean,
then you would owe me $ 12.50...

134
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:30,726
...instead of me owing you $ 7.50.

135
00:06:32,097 --> 00:06:34,691
- Either way.
- Yeah, it's the same thing.

136
00:06:36,235 --> 00:06:39,261
So can I have it?

137
00:06:40,506 --> 00:06:43,475
I tell you what, I'll get
the popcorn and the soda.

138
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:46,209
What do you mean,
you'll get the popcorn and the soda?

139
00:06:46,745 --> 00:06:50,545
I will buy your popcorn and soda,
and we'll call it even.

140
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:53,651
Tell you what. Give me the 20,
I'll buy you a popcorn and soda...

141
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,448
...and I'll throw in a bonbons.
- George, you're sapping my strength.

142
00:06:57,623 --> 00:06:59,454
Come on. Go.

143
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:01,416
What about Kramer and Jerry?

144
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:03,584
I'll wait here for them.
You go save seats.

145
00:07:03,762 --> 00:07:06,230
Me? But that's three seats.
I can't save three seats.

146
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:08,525
I told you about that guy
who tore up my coat.

147
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,897
- Save them, go.
- No, but George...

148
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,401
Fifty-Fifth Street. Great idea.

149
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:22,774
Saturday night, theater traffic.
Good move.

150
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:25,678
I wonder how lke Turner
would react in traffic.

151
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:28,513
"You better move that car, girl,
before I bust you up."

152
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:31,212
And what about Jose Feliciano?

153
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,985
"It's not bad enough that I can't see,
I have to sit here for two hours.

154
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,525
I don't think so."

155
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:37,923
It can be anybody.

156
00:07:38,097 --> 00:07:41,362
People down through history
reacting in traffic.

157
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:43,194
Franklin Roosevelt:

158
00:07:43,368 --> 00:07:46,633
- "Driver..."
- All right, all right. I got the bit.

159
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:50,135
Jerry, I want you to have
this piece of material.

160
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:52,209
That's nice of you.
I can't do the voices.

161
00:07:52,377 --> 00:07:54,345
Jerry, don't start up with me.

162
00:07:54,513 --> 00:07:56,481
I gotta get out of this cab.

163
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:58,240
But, Jerry, we're riffing.

164
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:03,411
No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring.
Do you understand the difference?

165
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:07,384
Can you help me
get on The Tonight Show?

166
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:12,656
No, these are saved.

167
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:13,957
- All of them?
- Yeah.

168
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,658
- You can't take four seats.
- What, is that a rule?

169
00:08:21,673 --> 00:08:23,231
- Are these your things?
- Yeah.

170
00:08:23,408 --> 00:08:26,036
Elaine, I can't wait anymore.
I'm gonna miss the beginning.

171
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:29,305
Well, we'll take these seats.
Would you please remove your stuff?

172
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:32,177
- No, no, they'll be here.
- But I am here. They are not.

173
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:34,945
They're coming. George, listen,
run over to the Paragon...

174
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,645
...and give Kramer the two tickets
so they can come in.

175
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:39,313
These are taken. Taken.

176
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:41,721
If you hurry back,
you won't miss the beginning.

177
00:08:42,427 --> 00:08:45,521
You go, and I could save the seats.
You don't like saving anyway.

178
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:49,824
No, taken! Taken, taken.
I'm getting the hang of it.

179
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:52,596
Why don't you give me the 20,
I'll stop and get change...

180
00:08:52,771 --> 00:08:54,830
...and then you and I can,
you know, settle up.

181
00:08:55,007 --> 00:08:56,338
Can we do this later, George?

182
00:08:57,476 --> 00:08:59,341
What's the point
of discussing it anymore.

183
00:08:59,511 --> 00:09:02,275
You'll give me the money
when you have it.

184
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:06,678
I trust you.

185
00:09:17,229 --> 00:09:18,457
Will you do me a favor?

186
00:09:18,764 --> 00:09:20,459
You see a guy who's
about 5 foot 11...

187
00:09:20,632 --> 00:09:22,930
...he's got a big head
and flared nostrils...

188
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:25,899
...tell him his friend's gonna be
right back, okay?

189
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,534
No, I'm sorry. These are taken.

190
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,404
They're in the lobby buying popcorn.

191
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:34,409
What are you doing?
These are taken!

192
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,946
- Which one?
- These two and this one.

193
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:38,980
No, don't come over here!
These are taken.

194
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,051
Go! Go! These are taken.

195
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,984
They're taken! They're taken!

196
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:46,617
Oh, take them.

197
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,390
Excuse me, have you
seen a guy with, like...

198
00:09:56,568 --> 00:09:59,731
...a horse face, big teeth
and a pointed nose?

199
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:02,165
- Flared nostrils?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:04,138
Nope. Haven't seen him.

201
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,914
Jerry, could you do me
a personal favor?

202
00:10:15,087 --> 00:10:18,079
And if I'm out of line,
please let me know.

203
00:10:18,257 --> 00:10:21,920
Could I keep my trench coat
in your closet for a few months?

204
00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:23,584
Your trench coat in my closet?

205
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:26,128
Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills.

206
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:27,993
I'm afraid to open the door.

207
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,758
Just for a few months.

208
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:31,994
It'll make all the difference
in the world.

209
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,001
I can't keep your coat in my closet.

210
00:10:34,172 --> 00:10:36,663
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
- Well, that's how I feel.

211
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:39,640
Hey, your friends aren't here.

212
00:10:40,212 --> 00:10:43,545
They must be inside. I'm gonna run in
and tell them I can't make the movie.

213
00:10:43,715 --> 00:10:47,446
We should go see Rochelle Rochelle.
I hear it's really hot.

214
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:50,554
- No, thanks. Maybe some other time.
- Really? Do you mean that?

215
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:52,386
No, I don't.

216
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:54,787
But you like the athlete's-foot bit,
right?

217
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,123
No. No. I was kidding.
It was terrible.

218
00:10:58,297 --> 00:10:59,764
Here you go. I'll see you later.

219
00:10:59,931 --> 00:11:02,126
- Do you want me to wait for you?
- No. Don't wait.

220
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:05,395
Jerry, I'll wait just to make sure
you get in, that's all.

221
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,765
I got friends inside
I need to get a message to.

222
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:09,998
You mind if I walk through
real quick?

223
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:12,141
Go ahead.

224
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:14,142
Bye-bye.

225
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:16,546
Hey, did that guy show up?

226
00:11:16,715 --> 00:11:19,878
The guy with the horse face
and the big teeth?

227
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:22,486
No, the guy with the big head
and the flared nostrils.

228
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:24,788
Haven't seen him.

229
00:11:25,457 --> 00:11:27,891
There was a short guy with glasses...

230
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,223
...looked like Humpty-Dumpty
with a melon head.

231
00:11:31,396 --> 00:11:33,091
But he left.

232
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,164
So I got home,
and he was vacuuming.

233
00:11:38,337 --> 00:11:40,134
I mean, he's 12 years old.

234
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:43,399
Who else but my Alan
would do something like that?

235
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:47,136
And then last night,
he put on my high heels.

236
00:11:47,312 --> 00:11:49,075
He put on such a show for us.

237
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:52,341
He was dancing around,
lip-synching to A Chorus Line.

238
00:11:52,517 --> 00:11:54,075
I mean, you can see
he's got talent.

239
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:56,311
Excuse me. Excuse me.

240
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:57,921
What's the problem?

241
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,523
You're talking.

242
00:11:59,691 --> 00:12:02,421
It's the coming attractions.

243
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:05,154
So anyway, he sings, he dances.

244
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,059
And you know what
he's gotten into now?

245
00:12:07,232 --> 00:12:09,928
He is cooking. He does a great...

246
00:12:11,803 --> 00:12:13,464
Ticket, sir?

247
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:16,069
I just went out.
I went to look for my friend.

248
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:17,469
Do you have your stub?

249
00:12:17,642 --> 00:12:19,542
My stub?

250
00:12:20,112 --> 00:12:22,080
Who keeps the stub?

251
00:12:22,247 --> 00:12:24,511
No one holds on to the stub.

252
00:12:24,683 --> 00:12:28,551
I'm going to the movies for 25 years,
nobody ever asked me for the stub.

253
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:32,085
- You don't remember me?
- It's a big city, sir.

254
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:33,588
I went in with a pretty woman.

255
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,455
You know, short, big wall of hair,
face like a frying pan.

256
00:12:36,628 --> 00:12:37,890
Nope.

257
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:43,562
- I can't find it.
- I can't let you in without your stub.

258
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:49,401
All right. Here. It's my friend's ticket.

259
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:02,549
Elaine?

260
00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:08,022
- Elaine?
- Sit down!

261
00:13:09,661 --> 00:13:11,822
- Elaine?
- Hey, shut up!

262
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:13,259
I'm looking for my friend.

263
00:13:13,432 --> 00:13:15,263
Check the bathroom.
You're bothering us.

264
00:13:15,434 --> 00:13:17,766
I know my friend's here.
What do you want me to do?

265
00:13:17,936 --> 00:13:19,198
You can shut up!

266
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,832
- Elaine?
- Shut up!

267
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:33,941
Elaine?

268
00:13:34,252 --> 00:13:36,117
Elaine?

269
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:39,986
The Village Voice calls it
a masterpiece.

270
00:13:40,158 --> 00:13:44,458
A young woman's strange, erotic
journey from Milan to Minsk.

271
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:50,397
It's a story about life and love
and becoming a woman.

272
00:13:50,569 --> 00:13:52,764
Rochelle Rochelle.

273
00:13:52,938 --> 00:13:56,066
Now playing at the Paradise Two.

274
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:25,959
Thank you.

275
00:14:26,304 --> 00:14:27,703
Can I have a medium Diet Coke?

276
00:14:27,873 --> 00:14:30,740
- You want the medium or middle size?
- What's the difference?

277
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:33,207
Well, we have three sizes:
medium, large and jumbo.

278
00:14:33,378 --> 00:14:34,709
What happened to the small?

279
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,575
There is no small. Small's medium.

280
00:14:37,182 --> 00:14:38,672
So, what's medium?

281
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,374
Medium's large,
and large is jumbo.

282
00:14:40,819 --> 00:14:43,287
- Okay, give me the large.
- That's medium.

283
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:46,121
Right. Yeah.
Can I have a small popcorn?

284
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,623
There is no small.
Child-size is small.

285
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:51,023
- What's medium?
- Adult.

286
00:14:51,363 --> 00:14:55,493
- Do adults ever order the child-size?
- Not usually.

287
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,928
- Okay, give me the adult.
- Do you want butter?

288
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:00,196
- Is it real butter?
- It's butter flavoring.

289
00:15:00,372 --> 00:15:02,033
Yeah, well, what is it made of?

290
00:15:02,207 --> 00:15:03,765
It's yellow.

291
00:15:10,682 --> 00:15:14,743
Thanks. Thank you. You don't know
how long I've been waiting out there.

292
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,219
Very busy tonight. Very busy.
Where you go?

293
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,324
Forty-Fourth and 9th.

294
00:15:20,492 --> 00:15:23,290
- Have you got a cigarette?
- No.

295
00:15:23,862 --> 00:15:25,454
Ticket, sir?

296
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,128
We've just been through this.

297
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,997
You don't remember? We just had
this exact conversation a minute ago.

298
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,467
I need to see your stub.

299
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,900
I got the stub. I got the stub.

300
00:15:39,077 --> 00:15:42,012
I put it right in my pocket.
I got the...

301
00:15:42,514 --> 00:15:44,505
I'm telling you, I got the stub.
I just...

302
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:48,278
- I don't know where it is.
- I can't let you in without your stub.

303
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:52,150
You just let me in.
We just did this a minute ago!

304
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,357
All right. Okay. There.
There you go, okay?

305
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,395
That's my other friend's ticket.
Happy now?

306
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:03,625
You got two tickets.
Two of my friends.

307
00:16:08,473 --> 00:16:09,701
Ticket, sir?

308
00:16:09,874 --> 00:16:13,275
No, see, my friend bought me a ticket.
See, I'm late. She's already inside.

309
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:15,140
- Go ahead. Enjoy the movie.
- Thanks.

310
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:24,118
- What is it, Your Majesty?
- Anyone asks...

311
00:16:24,322 --> 00:16:26,313
- Is that seat taken?
- It's all yours.

312
00:16:26,491 --> 00:16:28,925
When I tell you something,
you damn better well listen.

313
00:16:29,094 --> 00:16:32,120
- I'm getting tired of these questions.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

314
00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:36,233
I'm sorry, Grendel, I...
I've been very taxed lately.

315
00:16:36,668 --> 00:16:38,863
Yeah, I'm very sorry.
You give me a few minutes.

316
00:16:39,037 --> 00:16:41,028
I have to stop for gasoline.

317
00:16:41,206 --> 00:16:43,333
Gasoline? Can't you get it
after you drop me off?

318
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:48,138
No. Impossible.
It is on empty. See.

319
00:16:48,313 --> 00:16:51,077
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

320
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:55,411
What happened to my seat?

321
00:16:55,587 --> 00:16:57,487
Oh, my God, where was I?

322
00:16:57,656 --> 00:17:00,557
- Hey, sit down. I can't see.
- Get out of the way.

323
00:17:00,725 --> 00:17:01,987
I can't find my seat.

324
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,924
- Just move!
- No, you move!

325
00:17:05,096 --> 00:17:07,257
Get the hell out of here!

326
00:17:10,802 --> 00:17:12,929
Come, come, you're soaking wet.
Come in.

327
00:17:13,104 --> 00:17:15,163
My name is Rochelle.
I'm from Milan.

328
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,274
I'm supposed to visit
my relatives in Minsk.

329
00:17:17,442 --> 00:17:18,773
Yes. Come by the fire.

330
00:17:18,943 --> 00:17:21,036
Take off those wet clothes.
You'll catch cold.

331
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:25,046
My hands are so cold,
I can barely get these buttons open.

332
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:29,211
That's much better.
Much, much better.

333
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:39,389
Listen, I just went
to go get popcorn and...

334
00:17:39,564 --> 00:17:43,022
God. I just went to go
get popcorn, okay...

335
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:46,034
...and somebody took my seat,
and my coat is in there.

336
00:17:46,204 --> 00:17:47,796
There's a seat in the front row.

337
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:49,872
No, no, I can't sit in the front row.

338
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,531
You're gonna have to wait then.

339
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,076
I can't stand around here
for two hours.

340
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:56,645
I can let you see
Rochelle Rochelle.

341
00:17:57,782 --> 00:17:59,579
Thanks.

342
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:02,683
Hey, listen, by the way...

343
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:05,789
...have you seen
a tall, lanky doofus...

344
00:18:05,957 --> 00:18:09,916
...with a bird face and hair like
the Bride of Frankenstein?

345
00:18:10,462 --> 00:18:12,225
Haven't seen him.

346
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:14,162
Okay.

347
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:17,768
Let's go. I'm gonna miss my spot.

348
00:18:17,936 --> 00:18:19,528
Yes, yes, we go. We go.

349
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:21,968
One minute. I run across
the street for cigarettes.

350
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,131
I don't have time.
I'm gonna miss my spot.

351
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:27,608
No, no. We go very soon.

352
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,244
I didn't know you enjoyed chess,
Your Majesty.

353
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,815
Why wouldn't I?

354
00:18:32,984 --> 00:18:35,452
Well, because the king
is always in jeopardy.

355
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,485
Yes, but it's only a game.

356
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:41,352
Yes, of course. Only a game.

357
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:49,662
- Hey, did I make it?
- Sorry.

358
00:18:49,834 --> 00:18:53,361
Great. That's great. What a night.

359
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:55,062
Pat Buckles, ladies and gentlemen.

360
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,936
Another round of applause
for Pat Buckles.

361
00:18:58,109 --> 00:18:59,542
Good set.

362
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,042
You got my spot?

363
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:04,443
- That athlete's-foot bit killed.
- Really?

364
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:07,710
- You think I need to lose some weight?
- Weight? No.

365
00:19:07,886 --> 00:19:09,820
You just need some height.

366
00:19:09,988 --> 00:19:12,889
Jerry, don't start up with me.
What are you doing now?

367
00:19:13,057 --> 00:19:14,888
What am I doing?
My whole night's ruined.

368
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,186
I didn't do any sets.
I didn't go to the movies.

369
00:19:17,362 --> 00:19:19,853
Come on. We can still catch
most of Rochelle Rochelle.

370
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:21,191
Rochelle Rochelle?

371
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,036
A young girl's strange, erotic
journey from Milan to Minsk.

372
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:27,895
Minsk?

373
00:19:29,374 --> 00:19:30,705
My father was a shoemaker.

374
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,866
He worked hard,
and we didn't have much money.

375
00:19:33,044 --> 00:19:35,342
Rochelle, Rochelle,
what are we going to do with you?

376
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:37,913
- I'm going away tomorrow.
- Where? Where are you going?

377
00:19:38,082 --> 00:19:39,811
I want to go with you.
Take me with you.

378
00:19:39,984 --> 00:19:41,281
Well, don't be a silly goose.

379
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:44,546
But I've never seen Minsk. I hear
there's so much hustle and bustle.

380
00:19:44,722 --> 00:19:47,190
You're being absurd.
Leave me alone.

381
00:19:47,592 --> 00:19:51,050
- Rochelle, Rochelle, do you know...?
- Give me a break!

382
00:19:53,698 --> 00:19:55,563
Elaine?

383
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:58,602
- Jerry.
- Elaine.

384
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,897
- Shut up.
- Jerry?

385
00:20:01,773 --> 00:20:04,173
- George?
- Elaine?

386
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:05,570
George.

387
00:20:05,743 --> 00:20:07,973
- But where's Kramer?
- Will you shut up?

388
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:10,774
I don't know.
Does this movie stink or what?

389
00:20:10,949 --> 00:20:13,440
Let's get out of here. I'll see you.

390
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:14,880
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

391
00:20:15,053 --> 00:20:18,420
Jerry, take the coat.
Please. One month.

392
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,820
I don't want the coat.

393
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:25,424
Jerry, call me when you get home,
so I know you're okay.

394
00:20:25,864 --> 00:20:28,424
- What happened to you?
- I missed you at the other theater.

395
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,727
Then I missed my set,
and I had nothing to do.

396
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:32,836
Man. Look at this.

397
00:20:33,004 --> 00:20:34,562
I sat in gum.

398
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:35,933
What happened to Checkmate?

399
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:39,599
Oh, I went out to get popcorn,
and some creep took my seat.

400
00:20:39,777 --> 00:20:41,642
Hey, by the way,
you owe me $ 7.50.

401
00:20:41,813 --> 00:20:45,214
- But I didn't even use the ticket.
- I still paid for it.

402
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,914
- I only have a 20.
- Hi.

403
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:49,747
- Hey!
- What happened to you?

404
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:53,357
That's my coat. Give me that.
Where did you get that?

405
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:54,957
It was on the seat.

406
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:56,525
You took my seat?

407
00:20:56,694 --> 00:20:59,527
- You owe me $ 7.50.
- Yeah. Right.

408
00:21:00,198 --> 00:21:02,826
What is this stain?

409
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:06,596
It's yellow mustard.
Can you break a 20?

410
00:21:06,771 --> 00:21:10,468
But I always get confused
in the movie theater by the plot.

411
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:14,339
It's embarrassing to have to admit,
but I'm the one you see...

412
00:21:14,512 --> 00:21:17,970
...in the parking lot, after the movie,
talking with his friends, going:

413
00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:21,915
"You mean, that was the same guy
from the beginning?"

414
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:28,418
Nobody will explain it to you.
In the theater, you can't find out.

415
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:30,788
Why did they kill that guy?

416
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:33,463
Why did they kill him?

417
00:21:34,432 --> 00:21:37,492
Who was that guy?
Who was that guy?

418
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:41,032
I thought he was with them.
Wasn't he with them?

419
00:21:41,205 --> 00:21:43,935
Why would they kill him
if he was with them?

420
00:21:45,343 --> 00:21:47,811
Oh, he wasn't really with them.

421
00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:50,106
I thought he was with them.

422
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,577
It's a good thing they killed him.
