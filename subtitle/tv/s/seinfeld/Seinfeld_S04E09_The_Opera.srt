1
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:06,613
The tuxedo is a woman's view
that men are all the same.

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,724
We might as well
dress them that way.

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:13,461
To me, a wedding is the joining
together of a beautiful, glowing bride...

4
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:15,189
...and some guy.

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,461
The tuxedo is a wedding safety
device, created by women...

6
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:21,696
...because they know that men
are undependable.

7
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:23,633
So in case the groom chickens out...

8
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:27,004
...everybody takes one step over,
and she marries the next guy.

9
00:00:27,378 --> 00:00:30,347
That's why the wedding vow isn't,
"Do you take Bill Simpson?"

10
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:32,539
It's, "Do you take this man?"

11
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,590
Leave a message.
I'll call you back. Thanks.

12
00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:44,351
Jerry? Joe Davola.

13
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:49,825
I have a hair on my tongue.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,297
Can't get it off.

15
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,459
You know how much I hate that?

16
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:56,865
Of course you do.
You put it there.

17
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,009
I know what you said about me,
Seinfeld.

18
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:02,202
I know you bad-mouthed me
to the execs at NBC.

19
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:04,904
Put the kibosh on my deal.

20
00:01:05,082 --> 00:01:08,051
Now I'm gonna put the kibosh on you.

21
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:10,520
You know I've kiboshed before.

22
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:14,123
And I will kibosh again.

23
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,757
- So, what do you think?
- About what?

24
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:24,935
- About the opera.
- I don't wanna go.

25
00:01:25,102 --> 00:01:27,400
- You gotta go.
- I don't like the opera.

26
00:01:27,571 --> 00:01:30,369
What are they singing for?
Who sings?

27
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:33,233
You got something to say, say it.

28
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:36,379
You don't understand.
That's the way they talk in Italy.

29
00:01:36,547 --> 00:01:38,606
They sing to one another.

30
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:46,350
All right. All right.

31
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,616
That's their way.
You listen to the language.

32
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:50,987
It's got that sing-songy quality to it.

33
00:01:51,161 --> 00:01:53,459
It's the language, Jerry.
The language.

34
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:57,560
- So why don't they talk like that now?
- It's too hard to keep up.

35
00:01:57,735 --> 00:02:00,329
You know, they got...
They were tired.

36
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:02,635
- Better get that.
- Yeah.

37
00:02:02,806 --> 00:02:04,933
- It's me.
- Come on up.

38
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:07,339
- So?
- I don't know.

39
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:11,971
Come on. It's opening night.
Black-tie, Pagliacci. The great clown.

40
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:15,312
The great, sad, tragic clown,
like you.

41
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,014
Well, that's very flattering.

42
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:21,316
How'd you get tickets?
They're impossible to get.

43
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:23,551
Well, I have many associates.

44
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:26,921
I don't know.
Opera, it's not my kind of thing.

45
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:29,190
Then I'm gonna call
the whole thing off.

46
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:31,994
Wait a minute. What about
George, Susan and Elaine?

47
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:34,194
- Why do you need me?
- You're the nucleus...

48
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:37,772
...the straw that stirs the drink.
You're the "magliana."

49
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:40,533
I guess if I'm the magliana,
I should go.

50
00:02:40,711 --> 00:02:42,542
All right. All right.

51
00:02:42,713 --> 00:02:44,010
- Good.
- Hey.

52
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:45,409
You got the tickets, right?

53
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:49,245
- No, I don't have them on me.
- What? That's why I came over here.

54
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,547
My friend's got them.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

55
00:02:51,722 --> 00:02:55,852
I was gonna surprise Joey with them.
You got an extra one, right?

56
00:02:56,026 --> 00:02:57,493
Oh, yeah!

57
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:02,223
So I finally get to meet
your pal Joey.

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,825
- It's killing you, isn't it?
- Yeah.

59
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:08,130
So Joey's a great lover of the opera.

60
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:10,296
Listen...

61
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,474
...I got news for you.

62
00:03:12,643 --> 00:03:14,474
It's nice to be involved
with somebody...

63
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:17,478
...who's interested in something
other than Nick at Nite.

64
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:21,383
You know, he's got a grip on reality.

65
00:03:21,552 --> 00:03:24,885
He's... He's happy. He's well-adjusted.

66
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,030
Looking forward to meeting him.

67
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,827
I gotta go.

68
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:39,663
Where? What's the rush?

69
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:41,896
To surprise Joey.
I've never been to his place.

70
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:45,007
- I'm just gonna pop in.
- Good, men love that.

71
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,043
Hey.

72
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:52,243
You got a message, buddy.

73
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,906
It could be from that blond.

74
00:03:57,488 --> 00:04:00,480
Jerry? Joe Davola.

75
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,183
I have a hair on my tongue.

76
00:04:11,468 --> 00:04:13,959
What am I gonna do?
He's gonna put the kibosh on me.

77
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:18,097
- He's crazy, out of his mind!
- Steady, steady! Now, calm yourself!

78
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:21,244
He's supposed to be on medication.
He told me he was on medication.

79
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:24,039
- What happened to his medication?
- Quiet! Now let me think.

80
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:27,144
I'm gonna call the cops.
That's what I'm doing. The cops.

81
00:04:27,384 --> 00:04:29,352
Why?! They're not gonna
do anything!

82
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,351
They're the cops.
They gotta do something.

83
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:34,457
He'll put the kibosh on me. Do you
know what it is to be kiboshed?

84
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:38,890
- Kibosh.
- It's a terrible mistake.

85
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:42,463
He thinks I ruined some deal at NBC.
I don't know anything about it.

86
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:45,966
- Call and tell him that.
- That... That's what I'll do.

87
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:50,163
I'll just call him and tell him.
That's all I'll do. Right.

88
00:04:50,474 --> 00:04:53,966
He's a human being.
I'll talk to him. He'll understand, right?

89
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:55,907
Yeah.

90
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,478
Don't mention my name.

91
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:03,150
Oh, I got the machine.

92
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,845
- What's his message like?
- Nice.

93
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,123
Hello, Joe. Listen,
this is Jerry Seinfeld.

94
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:11,955
I think there's been a huge, colossal
misunderstanding.

95
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:14,723
Big. Big.

96
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,298
If we could just talk,
we could straighten this out...

97
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:20,265
...so call me back. Bye.

98
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,098
Joey?

99
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:27,772
Joey?

100
00:05:46,463 --> 00:05:50,194
Oh, God. It's you. You scared me.

101
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:53,063
Good. Fear's our most
primal emotion.

102
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:56,900
You left your door open.

103
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,701
I know. I like to encourage intruders.

104
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,907
What is all this?

105
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,345
Do you like it?

106
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:11,476
My home is a shrine to you.

107
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:13,951
Where did you get all these pictures?

108
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,116
I took them myself
with a telephoto lens.

109
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:20,658
Coming out of your office,
your apartment.

110
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:22,523
Shopping.

111
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:24,257
Showering.

112
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:28,394
Showering?

113
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:30,301
I develop them myself
in my darkroom.

114
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,669
Would you...? Would you like to see?

115
00:06:33,944 --> 00:06:36,742
In the darkroom?
Oh, no, thank you.

116
00:06:36,914 --> 00:06:39,144
Not right now.

117
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:42,342
I'm a day person.

118
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,820
Are...? Are you all right?

119
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,920
Why?

120
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:54,725
Well, I don't know.
You just don't...

121
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:57,765
...seem yourself.
- Who am I?

122
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:02,097
- Who am I supposed to be?
- That's a good question.

123
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:05,799
Good question. It's very existential.

124
00:07:05,976 --> 00:07:09,537
Who are you? Who am I?
Well...

125
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:11,375
What are you doing here?

126
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:14,278
Oh, nothing. I just stopped by
to chat.

127
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:16,783
You know, shoot the breeze.

128
00:07:16,954 --> 00:07:20,082
Were you able to get those Pagliacci
opera tickets from your friend?

129
00:07:20,257 --> 00:07:21,986
I'm really looking forward to it.

130
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:28,055
No, he couldn't get them.
We're not going.

131
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:30,088
Really?

132
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:35,769
Oh, damn it.
I just remembered I gotta go.

133
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:40,569
I left something on. The gas,
the lights, the water in the tub.

134
00:07:40,744 --> 00:07:43,611
Something is on somewhere,
so I'm just gonna get the...

135
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,708
Do you know the story of Pagliacci,
Nedda?

136
00:07:49,987 --> 00:07:51,545
I'm Elaine.

137
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:54,690
He's a clown whose wife
is unfaithful to him.

138
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:59,294
Do you think I'm a clown, Nedda?

139
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:04,099
Do I think you're a clown?
No. Not if it's bad to be a clown.

140
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:08,226
If it's bad to be a clown, then
you are definitely not a clown.

141
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:13,308
But if it's good to be a clown, then I
would have to rethink the whole thing.

142
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:16,875
You've betrayed me with another,
haven't you, Nedda?

143
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:19,174
Who is he? I want you
to tell me who he is.

144
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,647
I want his name. Tell me his name.

145
00:08:21,818 --> 00:08:25,413
Oh, like any man would
ever look at me. Come on.

146
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:27,784
I'm gonna get out of here.

147
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,926
Pagliacci kills his wife.

148
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,585
See? Now that's terrible. That is...
That's not a nice thing to do at all.

149
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:37,393
I would assume... I don't know how
this Pagliacci thing turns out.

150
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:41,526
But I would assume that there was
big, big trouble for that clown.

151
00:08:41,872 --> 00:08:43,100
You're not leaving.

152
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:50,843
But, officer, he threatened me.

153
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:52,606
I don't understand.
That's not right.

154
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:56,150
What if it was the president
of the U.S.? I bet you'd investigate.

155
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,187
So, what's the difference?
I'm a comedian of the United States.

156
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,388
And I'll tell you, I'm under
just as much pressure.

157
00:09:03,827 --> 00:09:07,092
All right. Thanks anyway.
Okay, bye.

158
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,860
- Who is it?
- It's George.

159
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,707
- You're locking the door now?
- Yeah.

160
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,749
Well, well. Look at you.

161
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,052
It's a little skimpy there, isn't it?

162
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:39,891
You know the last time
I wore this thing?

163
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:41,291
Six years ago.

164
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:43,763
When I made that toast
at Bobby Leighton's wedding.

165
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:46,027
Oh, that was a bad toast.

166
00:09:46,203 --> 00:09:47,602
It wasn't that bad.

167
00:09:47,771 --> 00:09:50,296
I never heard anybody curse
in a toast.

168
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,032
I was trying to loosen them up
a little bit.

169
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,939
There were old people there.

170
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:59,071
All the relatives.
You were like a Redd Foxx record.

171
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,045
At the end of the toast,
nobody even drank.

172
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:04,983
They were just standing. They were
just frozen. People...

173
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:09,286
That might have been
one of the worst all-time toasts.

174
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:12,690
Still, her father didn't have
to throw me out like that.

175
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,297
He could've asked me to leave.
He had me in a headlock.

176
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,133
Susan's not going tonight.

177
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,162
What do you mean, not going?
Why not?

178
00:10:20,337 --> 00:10:22,532
She had to pick up a friend
at the airport.

179
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,537
It cost me $ 100, this ticket.

180
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:27,472
- Why didn't she pay for hers?
- That's a very good question.

181
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:30,909
She and I go to dinner,
she doesn't even reach for the check.

182
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,743
All I'm asking for is a reach.
Is that so much to ask for?

183
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:35,578
It's nice to get a reach.

184
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,819
- Who is it?
- It's me!

185
00:10:43,026 --> 00:10:45,494
Why are you locking the door now?

186
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:47,395
Because of Davola.
Get in here.

187
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,532
What the...?

188
00:10:51,468 --> 00:10:53,993
- How come you're not dressed?
- I am dressed.

189
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:56,969
- You're going like this?
- Yeah. I want you to hear something.

190
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,270
- You said people dress up for opera.
- Well, people do. I don't.

191
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,381
If you're going like that,
I'm not going like this.

192
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:09,007
Wait a minute! Do you think
I'm comfortable here?

193
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,580
I can't change. I got no clothes here.

194
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,019
You gotta go like that.
I can't go like this alone.

195
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:17,058
Why should I be uncomfortable
because my apartment is closer?

196
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:19,286
That's not the issue. We're friends.

197
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:21,453
If I gotta be uncomfortable,
you gotta too.

198
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:25,032
All right. I'll wear this. It's bad enough
I gotta go to the opera...

199
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:28,000
...I gotta sit next to Ozzie Nelson
over here.

200
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:30,967
Would you turn that down?
What is that crap?

201
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:32,870
It's Pagliacci.

202
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:34,533
Oh, beautiful.

203
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:37,179
We got a little problem here.
We got two extra tickets.

204
00:11:37,347 --> 00:11:39,542
- Why, what happened?
- Susan isn't going...

205
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:43,652
...and Elaine's friend isn't going.
- Fantastic. We'll scalp the tickets.

206
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,380
We can make maybe 500 a ticket.

207
00:11:46,556 --> 00:11:47,989
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

208
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:50,683
People are looking for tickets here?

209
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:55,891
Are you kidding? Opening night,
Pavarotti in Pagliacci?

210
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:59,160
- We're gonna clean up.
- Oh, man, I knew I'd love the opera.

211
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:02,669
- Yeah, right.
- Come on, let's go get the tickets.

212
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:05,706
Listen, I gotta wait for Elaine.
I'll meet you at the theater.

213
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,706
- All right, yeah.
- Isn't scalping illegal?

214
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:09,708
Oh, yeah.

215
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:30,422
You sprayed him in the eyes
with Binaca?

216
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,471
Cherry Binaca. It's new.

217
00:12:35,805 --> 00:12:38,330
See, I don't get that.
First they come out with regular.

218
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,941
A year later, they have cherry.

219
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,341
They know we like cherry. Start with
cherry. Then come out with regular.

220
00:12:43,813 --> 00:12:46,646
It was like I didn't know him.
He was a different person.

221
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,850
You should hear the message
from my nut.

222
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,521
Where's George and Kramer?
I wanna get inside already.

223
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,680
I feel very vulnerable.

224
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:57,092
What you doing?
That's my quarter.

225
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,457
- No, it's not. It's mine.
- I was just flipping it. That's mine.

226
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,961
No, I dropped it. It's mine.

227
00:13:02,132 --> 00:13:05,465
All right, you want it, take it,
but don't try and tell me it's yours.

228
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:07,068
Well, it is mine.

229
00:13:07,504 --> 00:13:09,199
What, you think I care
about the money?

230
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,067
Is that what you think? I'll show you.

231
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:12,902
Look at this. Here's a dollar. Look.

232
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:14,600
That's how much
I care about money.

233
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:18,111
You think I care about money.
That's how much I care about money.

234
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:20,146
- Why don't you get lost?
- Why don't you?

235
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:22,376
- Because I was standing here.
- Oh, yeah?

236
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,144
Yeah.

237
00:13:28,591 --> 00:13:31,560
I kind of like this opera crowd.
I feel tough.

238
00:13:34,264 --> 00:13:36,892
Anybody else got a problem?

239
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,234
- Hey, clown.
- Clown.

240
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:44,671
Make us laugh, clown.

241
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:47,332
- Nice face, clown.
- Make me laugh, clown.

242
00:13:55,051 --> 00:13:57,576
I got two. I got two. Pagliacci.

243
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,382
Who needs Pagliacci, huh?
Come on, the great tragic clown.

244
00:14:00,557 --> 00:14:03,685
Come on, check it out. He laughs,
he cries, he sings. Pagliacci.

245
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,226
I got two beauties right here.
Check it out.

246
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:08,330
- All right.
- Hey, hey, you selling?

247
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:10,022
I'm selling.

248
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,727
- Where are they?
- Orchestra, row G, dead center. Primo.

249
00:14:13,903 --> 00:14:16,269
You think you died
and went to heaven.

250
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,667
What do you want for them?

251
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:20,207
I'll tell you what I'll do.
You look like a nice guy.

252
00:14:20,477 --> 00:14:22,308
A thousand dollars for the deuce.

253
00:14:22,912 --> 00:14:25,210
- Give you $500 for the pair.
- Yeah. It's a deal.

254
00:14:25,382 --> 00:14:27,907
- No.
- What, no? Are you crazy?

255
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:31,383
- Look, let me handle this.
- That's $500. That's a great deal.

256
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:33,488
You're blowing it.
The guy's a pigeon.

257
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:37,752
Oh, God, see, he's walking away.
What is wrong with you?

258
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:39,792
That was a $300 profit.

259
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,624
I know what I'm doing here, George.

260
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,892
This is not a Metallica concert.
It's an opera, all right?

261
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:47,468
A little dignity. A little class.
Give me my ticket.

262
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,332
I will stand over here and sell it.

263
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:51,701
Thank you. Stand over there.
I'll stand over here.

264
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,900
- I know where I'm standing.
- All right.

265
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:56,602
- Get your Pagliaccis here!
- Pagliaccis right here, huh?

266
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:58,707
Where are they already?

267
00:14:58,882 --> 00:15:01,077
I guarantee you they don't
sell those tickets.

268
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,650
Hey, look. There's Bobby Leighton's
father-in-law. Mr. Reichman.

269
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,846
George and I were just talking
about him.

270
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,085
He threw George out of the wedding.

271
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:11,757
Oh, yeah, when George
made that bad toast.

272
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:15,261
- You remember the curse toast?
- Oh, yeah. The curse toast.

273
00:15:15,465 --> 00:15:16,796
Can you believe that message?

274
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:19,196
I gotta spend my life looking
over my shoulder.

275
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:21,234
Me too.

276
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,364
Crazy Joe Davola.

277
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:28,870
- How do you know his name?
- Why wouldn't I know his name?

278
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,941
- I never told you his name.
- I never told you his name.

279
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:34,977
- Who are we talking about here?
- Joe Davola.

280
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:37,483
Right, Joe Davola.

281
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:39,779
How do you know his name?

282
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,725
I've been out with him three times.
I should know the man's name.

283
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:48,296
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- He's stalking you?

284
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:50,626
- Are you kidding me?
- You're dating the madman...

285
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,701
...who's trying to kill me?
- Why didn't you tell me his name?

286
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,997
Last night he accused me
of seeing someone else.

287
00:15:56,172 --> 00:15:58,470
- He said, "Tell me his name!"
- He said that?

288
00:15:58,641 --> 00:16:00,700
If he sees us, can you imagine
what he'll do?

289
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,311
If he thinks I ruined his NBC deal
and stole his girl!

290
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,415
- That will be a kibosh for sure.
- What about me?

291
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,175
Excuse me.

292
00:16:08,818 --> 00:16:11,252
Come on. This is Pavarotti.

293
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:14,055
Three hundred dollars.
That's a lot of money.

294
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:17,284
Steven Holtzman did a production
in Tunis last year.

295
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,021
From what I understand,
the Muslims really took to it.

296
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:25,266
I'll tell you what. You seem like a
nice guy. Let's stop jerking around.

297
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:29,934
Give me $250. I got people waiting
for me. I gotta get the hell out of here.

298
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:33,073
Scalping. I told them
to put on extra security.

299
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,676
Excuse me.

300
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:37,673
Pop, would you buzz off?
I got something cooking here.

301
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:40,042
- Costanza?
- Mr. Reichman?

302
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:42,275
Still a sewer-mouth.
Give me those tickets.

303
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:48,015
Harold, don't. Harold, be careful
of your hair transplant!

304
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:50,682
Anything is welcome.
I accept change.

305
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,693
I don't have anything.
I gave it to that guy.

306
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,964
You know, you could just say no.

307
00:16:58,134 --> 00:16:59,567
You don't have to humiliate me.

308
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:03,103
I may be dressed as a clown,
but I am a person.

309
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,798
- The guy took...
- I don't need people like you...

310
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:07,533
...looking down their noses at me.

311
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,703
I am just a street performer
trying to make enough to get by.

312
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:14,349
Doctor, is there a doctor anywhere?

313
00:17:14,517 --> 00:17:16,041
We need a doctor!

314
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:19,586
What are you, showing off
for your girlfriend here, is that it?

315
00:17:19,756 --> 00:17:23,783
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated
for a while but things didn't work out.

316
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,061
You people make me sick.

317
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,469
That is one angry clown.

318
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,501
The hardest part
about being a clown...

319
00:17:35,672 --> 00:17:39,403
...it seems to me, would be that you're
constantly referred to as a clown.

320
00:17:39,576 --> 00:17:42,010
"Who is that clown?
I'm not working with that clown.

321
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:43,611
Did you hire that clown?

322
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,179
The guy's a clown."

323
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:47,246
How do you even start into
being a clown?

324
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:49,146
How do you know you
wanna be a clown?

325
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,117
I guess you just get to a point
where your pants look so bad...

326
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:54,723
...it's actually easier
to become a clown...

327
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:57,018
...than having the proper alterations
done.

328
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,194
If you think about it, a clown,
if there isn't a circus around them...

329
00:18:01,364 --> 00:18:03,798
...is really just a very annoying person.

330
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:07,334
I mean, you're in the back seat
of this guy's Volkswagen...

331
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,802
"What, you're picking somebody
else up? Oh, man."

332
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,266
I got one. Who needs one?
Pagliacci. Pagliacci.

333
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,941
The tragic clown. Pagliacci...

334
00:18:21,484 --> 00:18:23,247
What did you say?

335
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:25,914
What, are you a cop?

336
00:18:26,923 --> 00:18:28,652
No. I'm a clown.

337
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:32,294
Man, you look familiar.

338
00:18:33,496 --> 00:18:34,963
You ever been to the circus?

339
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:37,998
- Well, when I was a kid.
- Did you like it?

340
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,635
Well, it was fun.

341
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:43,864
Was kind of scared of the clowns.

342
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:47,674
Are you still scared of clowns?

343
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:50,536
Yeah.

344
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:54,547
We're gonna miss the overture.

345
00:18:54,717 --> 00:19:01,088
Overture, curtains, lights
This is it, we'll hit the heights

346
00:19:01,257 --> 00:19:07,423
And, oh, what heights we'll hit
On with the show, this is it

347
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:13,861
You know, it is so sad.

348
00:19:14,037 --> 00:19:17,063
All your knowledge of high culture
comes from Bugs Bunny cartoons.

349
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:22,336
Oh, there's that clown again.
What does he want from me?

350
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:24,840
Look, I'm serious.
I don't have the quarter.

351
00:19:25,014 --> 00:19:27,574
- That guy took it.
- I don't want any money.

352
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,512
I smell cherry.

353
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:36,390
- It's Binaca.
- Binaca?

354
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:42,692
Go! Go!

355
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:46,366
- All right, what did we say, 275?
- Two fifty.

356
00:19:47,003 --> 00:19:50,370
- Two fifty? Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

357
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,206
- All right. All right, 250.
- George!

358
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:55,811
- Susan.
- I don't believe it.

359
00:19:55,978 --> 00:19:58,037
I'm so glad I caught you.

360
00:19:58,381 --> 00:20:00,941
What are you doing here?
You were going to the airport.

361
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,312
Some plane problems.
They landed in Philadelphia.

362
00:20:03,486 --> 00:20:06,319
So what? They don't have another
plane? She couldn't take a bus?

363
00:20:06,489 --> 00:20:08,889
She's coming in tomorrow.
But I made it.

364
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:11,185
Yeah. How about that? You made it.

365
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,659
I'm so excited. Now we get to see
the opera together.

366
00:20:14,831 --> 00:20:18,323
We get to go to the opera...
Get out of here... Together.

367
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:20,992
- Who's that?
- That's, that's Harry Fong.

368
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,764
He's a very good friend of mine.
He's a big opera buff.

369
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,602
Enjoy the show there, Harry!

370
00:20:26,843 --> 00:20:29,744
- Come on. Let's go.
- You know what?

371
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:32,403
- Come on. You gotta let us in.
- Not without tickets.

372
00:20:32,582 --> 00:20:34,447
We have tickets. Just not with us.

373
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:37,518
Well, that's a problem. Excuse me.

374
00:20:38,121 --> 00:20:40,589
You don't understand.
Someone's after us, a crazy clown.

375
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:43,692
- He's trying to kill us!
- A crazy clown is after you?

376
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,260
Oh, that's rich.

377
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:48,556
Clear the way so people
with tickets can pass.

378
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:50,596
- We're with him.
- Are you guys ready?

379
00:20:50,767 --> 00:20:52,325
- Yes. Yes.
- Have you seen George?

380
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,970
- We thought he was with you.
- Come on. He's on his own.

381
00:20:55,138 --> 00:20:56,605
Here.

382
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,840
Here I come.

383
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:04,246
- These are great seats, huh?
- Yeah.

384
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:08,812
Boy, some cast, huh?
Pavarotti, Eva Marton.

385
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:11,215
Eva Marton. I've heard of her.

386
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:15,016
- Who's she playing?
- She's playing Pagliacci's wife, Nedda.

387
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,625
- Nedda?
- Yeah.

388
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:19,021
Oh, my God.

389
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,596
Excuse me. Excuse me.

390
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:24,062
Excuse me.

391
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:26,064
Excuse me.

392
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,537
Susan, what are you doing here?

393
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,841
- My friend's flight couldn't make it.
- Hi.

394
00:21:41,017 --> 00:21:43,781
- Where's George?
- I got his ticket.

395
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:46,683
He decided not to come.
He said he was uncomfortable.

396
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:48,289
Uncomfortable?

397
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:50,322
How do you think I feel?

398
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:55,019
- How much did you pay for that ticket?
- One seventy-five.

399
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,932
Kramer, who did you sell
your ticket to?

400
00:22:00,102 --> 00:22:03,094
Some nut in a clown suit.

401
00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:13,341
I had some friends drag me
to an opera recently.

402
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:15,541
They've all got those little
opera glasses.

403
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:19,586
Do you really need binoculars?
How big do these people have to get...

404
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:21,150
...before you can spot them?

405
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:26,557
These opera kids, they're going
250, 280, 325.

406
00:22:26,729 --> 00:22:28,754
They're wearing
big white woolly vests.

407
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:32,697
The women have the breastplates,
the bullet hats, the horns coming out.

408
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:35,099
You can't pick these people out,
forget opera.

409
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:40,106
Think about optometry.
Maybe that's more your thing.
