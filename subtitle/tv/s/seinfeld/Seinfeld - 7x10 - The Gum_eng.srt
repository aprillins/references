1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,991
Gum is one of the weirdest
human inventions.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,435
It's not a liquid. It's not a solid.
It's not a food.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,394
What is it?
It isn't really anything.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,758
You know, I mean, it's like
a stationary bike for your jaw.

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,798
Remember when you were in school
and teachers would get riled up...

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,313
...if they caught you with gum?

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,675
When you're a kid,
you think what's the big deal?

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,319
As an adult, I can understand it...

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,155
...because when you're chewing gum,
you don't look thrilled with anything.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,709
World War II, that was
an important historical event?

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,279
Yeah, I'm sure.

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,316
They landed a man
on the moon in 1969?

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,118
Yeah, right.

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,396
Yeah, I buy that, teach.

15
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,036
Do you think she's happy?

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,073
- Who?
- The cashier.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,510
- Ruthie Cohen?
- You know her name?

18
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,669
Sure.

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,798
- I don't think I've ever spoken to her.
- Maybe that's why she's happy.

20
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,796
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- What is this?

21
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,078
Well, it's the latest offering
from the Alex Theatre.

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,392
- That stinky old movie house?
- Well, you should smell it now.

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,154
- We fixed up the place.
- With Spartacus?

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,073
Well, it's a rare archival print.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,348
Twelve extra minutes,
full wide-screen Cinemascope.

26
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,593
And if you come to the 1:00 show,
you can hear Jeffrey Haarwood.

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,189
- Jeffrey who?
- Haarwood.

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,273
He was the assistant
wardrobe man on Spartacus.

29
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,954
He has some fascinating insights
into the production.

30
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,710
Why would you spend $7 to see
a movie that I could watch on TV?

31
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,438
Well, why go to a fine restaurant...

32
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,875
...when you can just stick something
in the microwave?

33
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,989
Why go to the park and fly a kite
when you can just pop a pill?

34
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,758
You guys haven't seen Lloyd Braun,
have you? I'm supposed to meet him.

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,399
Lloyd Braun? What for?

36
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,994
Well, he's using his connections
in the mayor's office...

37
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,310
...to get the theatre landmark status.

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,471
I thought he screwed up
the Dinkins campaign.

39
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,996
Well, he did. After that,
he had a nervous breakdown.

40
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,720
Had to spend a few months
in an institution.

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,992
- Really?
- Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now.

42
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,674
- I've taken him under my wing.
- Oh, then I'm not worried.

43
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,671
But he still needs all of our support.

44
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,514
When he gets here,
treat him like he's one of the gang.

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,874
Breakdown, huh?

46
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,110
- Hey, Kramer.
- Hey, Lloyd. Hey, buddy.

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,077
- How you doing? Hi, Jerry.
- Lloyd.

48
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,595
- George.
- Hello, Lloyd.

49
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,275
- How you doing?
- Well, he's doing fine, George.

50
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,796
- Gum.
- That's an interesting package.

51
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,518
Yeah, it's from China.

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,908
Go ahead, try a piece.

53
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,878
Tell me that's not the most
delicious gum you've ever tasted.

54
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,795
Yes, yes, we shall all try a piece
and tell you how delicious it is.

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,589
- George.
- I don't chew gum.

56
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,912
It's different. Where did you get it?

57
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,036
A friend of mine in Chinatown
gave it to me.

58
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,555
- I can ask him where he got it.
- No, don't bother.

59
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,199
- It's no problem.
- I don't want it.

60
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,316
Jerry, Lloyd says it's no problem.

61
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,597
He's capable of locating the gum.

62
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,716
- All right.
- Boy, this is... This is delicious.

63
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,158
You know what? I think this Ruthie
Cohen gave me the wrong change.

64
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,834
Didn't I pay with a 20?
I'm sure I paid with a 20.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,989
- Hey.
- Hey.

66
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,879
I think I finally figured out
what the flavour is in this gum.

67
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,190
It's a little lo meiny.

68
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,997
- What kind is that?
- It's Chinese gum.

69
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,675
- Lloyd Braun gave it to me.
- Lloyd Braun. How's he doing?

70
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,957
After Dinkins lost the election,
he had a complete nervous breakdown.

71
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,872
They had to lock him up.

72
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,156
That's around the same time
I broke up with Lloyd.

73
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,278
You don't think that I had anything
to do with his breakdown, do you?

74
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,830
I remember, when we parted company,
I was babbling incoherently for months.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,752
Yeah, well, I've got news for you.

76
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,593
While I was growing up
all I heard from my mother was:

77
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,149
"Why can't you be more
like that Lloyd Braun?"

78
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,914
And in the end, Lloyd Braun
became more like you.

79
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,994
- Right, gotta get going.
- Aren't you coming to Spartacus?

80
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,196
I gotta deliver Christmas
presents to my parents.

81
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,830
- I thought they were out of town.
- Why do you think I'm going now?

82
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,595
- Georgie.
- Hey, Mr. Lazzari.

83
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,239
Back in the old neighbourhood, huh?

84
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,675
Yeah, yeah, just delivering
some presents to my folks.

85
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,956
Oh, snazzy car.

86
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,914
- LeBaron?
- Yeah, '83.

87
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,672
It used to belong to Jon Voight.

88
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,559
- The actor, right?
- Something like that.

89
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,950
- Mind if I look under the hood?
- No, go ahead, Pop.

90
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,680
- You always knew your cars.
- Yeah.

91
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,956
Oh, Deena, Deena.
Deena, look who's here.

92
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,079
- George Costanza, is that you?
- Hey, Deena. Come on, give us a hug.

93
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,959
Oh, my gosh, you look as pretty
as you did back in high school.

94
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,190
Boy, those were some crazy times.

95
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,638
Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy,
did you hear about Lloyd Braun?

96
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,592
The Alex was built in 1922, during
the golden age of movie palaces.

97
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:00,313
Minor restorations in
1941, '47, '52, '58, '63...

98
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,314
...and currently to our present
period of time.

99
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,391
- You're really getting into this?
- I am.

100
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,109
The icing on the cake would be
that landmark status from the city.

101
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,794
We're hoping Lloyd Braun
can pull a few strings.

102
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,393
Oh, can on Lloyd really do that?

103
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,394
Lloyd Braun can do anything
he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry.

104
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,073
You should
say hello to him, Elaine.

105
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,992
What? Lloyd's here?
No, no, I'd rather...

106
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,073
- Hi, Elaine.
- Lloyd. Yes, hello.

107
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,275
Did Kramer tell you?

108
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,159
We reserved some special seats
so we can all sit together.

109
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,273
Oh, well, actually, Lloyd, Jerry and I
have to sit in the front row...

110
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,955
...because...
Because he forgot his glasses.

111
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,035
So thanks for getting us the...
We'll see you afterwards.

112
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,474
Come on.

113
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,071
That was odd.

114
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,113
Am I crazy
or does Jerry not wear glasses?

115
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,317
You're not crazy.
Jerry does wear glasses.

116
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,710
He just forgot them, that's all.

117
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,558
Not crazy.

118
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,997
We're all the way in the front row?
Couldn't we sit in the special seats?

119
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,197
I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd
thinking I was leading him on again.

120
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,033
Seeing him made me feel
very uncomfortable.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,560
No, you don't want
to be uncomfortable.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,198
- Poor Lloyd.
- I know. Completely bonkers.

123
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,753
I'm sorry I can't be so flip
about this kind of thing.

124
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,036
You know, after what
happened to Pop.

125
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,038
Pop? What happened to Pop?

126
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,872
I thought you heard.

127
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,712
He had a nervous breakdown
last year.

128
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,393
That's why I'm taking care of him.

129
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,790
I tell you, they don't build them
like this anymore.

130
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,714
He doesn't have
the auto shop anymore?

131
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,791
It was too much for him.

132
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,114
- I gotta go.
- What?

133
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,396
I just remembered
I gotta be someplace.

134
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,676
That's enough, Pop.
Put down the wrench, Pop.

135
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,157
Pop! Pop!

136
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,235
- Great movie, huh?
- Yeah.

137
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,517
- Sorry you forgot those glasses.
- I don't know what I was thinking.

138
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,434
- How did you like that gum?
- He loved it.

139
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,239
Kramer, you know,
there isn't a light in the ladies room.

140
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,391
Yeah, it's being repaired.

141
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,874
Oh, God.

142
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,511
- You all right?
- I sat too close to the screen.

143
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,435
I just gotta stretch out
in a hot bath.

144
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,830
It was nice see you again, Lloyd.

145
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,519
Officer. Officer, is there some reason
this man has too be using a hose.

146
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,312
I mean, he's flooding the sidewalk.

147
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,358
It's a waste of water.
Couldn't he just use a broom?

148
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,112
Lady, you sold me.

149
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,599
Hey, you with the hose.

150
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,914
Here, put these glasses on.

151
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,640
- What's this for?
- Lloyd's gonna be here any minute.

152
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,917
- So what?
- Well, he thinks you wear those.

153
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,640
They're from the lost and found
at the Alex.

154
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,109
This is ridiculous.
I'm not gonna put these on.

155
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,508
Oh, okay.

156
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,717
So he'll just think that the two of you
didn't sit with him on purpose.

157
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,190
Oh, yeah, that's very nice.
Very nice.

158
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,993
Excuse me,
I was in here this morning...

159
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,754
...and I believe I paid you
with a 20-dollar bill...

160
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,878
...but you only gave me
change for a 10.

161
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,270
- I don't think so.
- Oh, I think so.

162
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,668
And I can prove it.

163
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,432
You see, I was doodling
on the bill...

164
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,036
...and so if you have a 20 in there
with big lips on it...

165
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,189
...well, that's mine.

166
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,112
Would you mind
opening up the register?

167
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,633
Not unless you buy something.

168
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,871
Okay. Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.

169
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,632
Hey, George.

170
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,674
- Thought you didn't chew gum.
- I don't.

171
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,319
Take a look.

172
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,598
I know I gave it to you.

173
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,671
George, you mind?
I'm kind of in a hurry.

174
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,197
Fine, fine. Excuse me.

175
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,670
Think I'm gonna forget about this?
I haven't forgotten. I don't forget easily.

176
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,076
Hey, Jerry, look who's here.

177
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,549
- Oh, Lloyd.
- Hi, Jerry.

178
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,280
- Got some more of that gum.
- Oh, the gum.

179
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,234
Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?

180
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,472
- All right.
- Oh, boy.

181
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,629
Sit down.

182
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,792
Yeah, now, see, this is what
the holidays are all about.

183
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,599
Three buddies sitting around
chewing gum, huh?

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,433
Yeah.

185
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,233
So, you know, Lloyd,
he thinks he can get more of this.

186
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,671
Well, Lloyd
is a very industrious fellow.

187
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,310
I'm sure he can accomplish anything
he sets his mind to.

188
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,751
Actually, the importer
is right in Chinatown.

189
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,115
I'll introduce you.
You can get it get it whenever.

190
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,032
It's not necessary.

191
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,794
Hey, Jerry, you know,
Lloyd wants to do you a favour.

192
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,712
I know that, Kramer.

193
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,791
- lf you don't want to...
- Sure, he wants to.

194
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,396
And it's very kind of you.
Yeah, Jerry, he appreciates it.

195
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,109
- Don't you, Jerry?
- Yes, I do, Kramer.

196
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,396
- So how about that Elaine today?
- Oh, baby.

197
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,120
What is that all about, huh?

198
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,919
She was practically undressing
in front of me at the theatre.

199
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,073
- I didn't see anything.
- You really missed a show, buddy.

200
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,392
Yeah.

201
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,271
You're probably wondering
why I wanted to see you again.

202
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,675
Well, you know...

203
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,997
It's understandable.

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,433
I'm glad you feel that way.

205
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,909
Because since my father's
breakdown...

206
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,310
...l've become very sensitive
to the warning signs.

207
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,590
- Warning signs?
- Nervousness, irritability, paranoia.

208
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,432
What?

209
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,598
What are you talking about?
I'm not the one with the problem.

210
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,320
Lloyd Braun was in the nuthouse,
not me.

211
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,552
Yeah, and taking pleasure
in the misfortunes of others.

212
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,479
- All my friends do that.
- George, I'm only trying help.

213
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,959
I'm concerned.

214
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,589
George?

215
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,595
- Are you listening to me?
- Do you see that woman?

216
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,353
She stole $20 from me.

217
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,954
I might have gotten it back,
but Lloyd Braun interfered.

218
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,509
So again it all comes back to Lloyd.

219
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,999
Hey. Hey, you!

220
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,948
Get back here!
Don't gallop away. I'm on to you.

221
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,152
So you're saying
she was on a horse?

222
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,836
I'm telling you, that cashier
is riding horses on my money.

223
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,638
Well, here's what I propose.

224
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,631
Go down to the stables,
snoop around.

225
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,351
See if any high-flying cashier has been
throwing $20 bills around with big lips.

226
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,594
- Hey.
- Well, if it isn't Chesty Larue.

227
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,036
- What?
- I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun.

228
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,555
He was bragging about
the show you gave him at the Alex.

229
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,759
Oh, God. I lost a button,
so my blouse was wide open.

230
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,319
I must've left it at the theatre.

231
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,277
- Maybe it's in the lost and found.
- I know.

232
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,590
I have to go check it out.
It's a beautiful button.

233
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,478
It's antique ivory.
It was my mother's.

234
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,757
You know, the way you were wolfing
down that popcorn, maybe you ate it.

235
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,392
Mr. Haarwood, what an unexpected
surprise to have you back at the Alex.

236
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:45,075
Well, I'm in a bit of a quandary.
I've misplaced my spectacles.

237
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,198
Well, let's look in lost and found,
shall we?

238
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,913
They're half glasses.

239
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,910
- Brown?
- Yes, yes.

240
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,992
Yeah, well, if they're not in the box,
I'm sure they'll turn up soon.

241
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,992
Listen, could you keep
an eye on the place?

242
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,798
I wanna go get some paraffin wax...

243
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,918
...and bring out the lustre
of this vintage countertop.

244
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,877
Yes, certainly.

245
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,791
Oh, my goodness.

246
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,712
What a spanking button.

247
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,153
All right, all right.

248
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,240
Hang on. It's warming up.

249
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,035
Hey, what is your problem?

250
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,393
Oh, hello. It's you.

251
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,994
Listen, lady, I've got
six minutes left on that meter...

252
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,072
...and I'm not budging until
you admit you stole my $20.

253
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,072
You're not so stuff tough when you're
not on your horse, are you, Ruthie?

254
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,753
Your car's on fire.

255
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,999
Merry Christmas.

256
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,752
Fire!

257
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,717
- Your hose! Where's your hose?
- The cop made me disconnect it.

258
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,432
What happened to your car, buddy?

259
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,790
The Jon Voight car is no more.

260
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,237
Well, don't you sweat it. You can
use my car anytime you want to.

261
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,910
- No kidding?
- No kidding.

262
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,310
Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.

263
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,039
- Yeah, merry Christmas.
- Whatever.

264
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,633
- All right. I'm here. Where's Braun?
- What? He's not here yet?

265
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,519
Look. I'll go downtown to Chinatown
with him, but that is it.

266
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,398
- I need those glasses.
- Why?

267
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,755
They're Jeffrey Haarwood's.

268
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,595
Here, try this pair.

269
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,675
Wow, these are really...

270
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,473
Hey, gum-buddy. Nice frames.

271
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,200
- You ready to go?
- Yeah, yeah.

272
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,316
Yeah, he's all ready to go.

273
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,517
- Anybody see Elaine today?
- Oh, yeah, she called a little earlier.

274
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,513
She's coming over
to check out lost and found.

275
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,554
Maybe I'll stick around
and see what she's wearing today.

276
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,472
Or not wearing,
if you know what I mean.

277
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,551
Absolutely, let's just stick around.

278
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,517
I'll tell you what,
they're expecting us.

279
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,114
- Let me just grab a hot dog here.
- Oh, yeah.

280
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,989
I'd like a hot dog, please.

281
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,519
Are you out of your mind?

282
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,112
What's the problem here?

283
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,748
This hot dog's been here
since the silent era.

284
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,832
- You'd have to be insane to eat it.
- No, no, this man is not insane.

285
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,558
There's nothing wrong
with it or you.

286
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,233
- Kramer...
- No, no, I'll show you.

287
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,598
- One hot dog, please.
- Okay.

288
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,435
Doesn't that smell good, huh?

289
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,591
Here we go. Yeah.

290
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,669
Oh, that's delicious.

291
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,593
This is a perfectly sane food to eat.

292
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,035
Interesting texture.

293
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,077
It's chewy.

294
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,909
I gotta get some air.

295
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,438
Excuse me. Excuse me.

296
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,716
Weren't you told
to stop using that hose?

297
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,954
- How would you happen to know that?
- Well...

298
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,157
You're that lady that was
talking to the cops, aren't you?

299
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,832
- Hey, Joe!
- Oh, wait, wait! Stop it!

300
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,677
- Hey, everybody.
- Whoa, Elaine!

301
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,833
Once again you've managed
to top yourself.

302
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,599
Come on, Jerry, let's go.
The car is out front.

303
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,032
Lloyd.

304
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,554
Lloyd.

305
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,915
What is Lloyd's problem?

306
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,913
Look, honey, I know you're trying
to get Lloyd to notice you...

307
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,513
...but this is too much.

308
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,349
Parading around in a wet T-shirt.

309
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,112
I got sprayed with a hose.

310
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,874
Yeah, well, I'm sorry,
but the Alex is a family theatre...

311
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,837
...not one of your swing joints.

312
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,592
So you want my father
to pay for this?

313
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,910
Well, you saw him.
He was fiddling with the engine.

314
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,513
God knows what he did there.

315
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,399
And I suppose Lloyd Braun
had something to do with it too?

316
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,711
- Not Lloyd Braun, but the cashier.
- What cashier?

317
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,917
You remember the woman
on the horse? She wanted my spot.

318
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,114
- To park her horse?
- No, she wasn't on the horse.

319
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,074
So your car caught fire...

320
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,232
...because of my father
and the woman on the horse.

321
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,233
That's right. And him.

322
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,715
- The man with the flowers?
- Yeah, yeah, the flower guy.

323
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,792
Listen, I know this all sounds
a little crazy, but...

324
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,712
I can't believe it.
That's Jerry Seinfeld.

325
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,518
- Who?
- Jerry Seinfeld, my best friend.

326
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,796
He can explain all of this.
Jerry, Jerry!

327
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,190
Over here, Jerry. It's me!

328
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,079
Where are you going?
It's... What are you...?

329
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,479
- That was your best friend?
- Yeah.

330
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,791
- But he doesn't wear glasses.
- That man was wearing glasses.

331
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,793
Don't you see? He was doing it
to fool Lloyd Braun.

332
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,759
I'll run in and get the gum.

333
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,911
- All right.
- Got any money?

334
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,271
Here.

335
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,432
I'll be back.

336
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,270
Look, Deena, I know you think
I'm crazy, but I'm not.

337
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,113
This is just a series
of bad coincidences.

338
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,430
I don't know, George.
I don't know what to believe.

339
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,436
Believe me, I am not crazy.

340
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,673
Well, I guess it's possible.

341
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,917
Here you go.

342
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,672
- All this?
- Yeah.

343
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,718
- A hundred dollars worth.
- I gave you a hundred dollars?

344
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,108
You sure did.

345
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,955
- Am I crazy or is that a lot of gum?
- It's a lot of gum!

346
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,276
Mr. Haarwood, I found your glasses.

347
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,919
Oh, splendid.

348
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,469
Welcome to the
Institute for the Preservation...

349
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,598
...of Motion Picture Costumes
and Wardrobes.

350
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,990
The I.P.M.P.C.W.

351
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,910
We prefer to call it the Institute.

352
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,196
- Is that from Henry Vlll?
- Yes, yes, it is.

353
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,033
Yeah, well, you know, we're
screening that tonight at the Alex.

354
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,634
You think that I could wear
that to promote the theatre?

355
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,792
Well, I'd love to lend it to you,
but I doubt if it would fit a man...

356
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,430
...of your impressive
Raymond Massey-like physique.

357
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,672
The only person who could
really fit into this costume...

358
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,197
...would have to be a short, stocky man
of somewhat generous proportion.

359
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,276
You don't say.

360
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,276
You're really helping
me out with this, buddy.

361
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,512
- Kids are gonna be so thrilled.
- Yeah, yeah.

362
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,069
You really cashed in
on that favour pretty quick.

363
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,198
Remember, you are a king.
You must project a royal bearing.

364
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,828
Oh, I'm going to give you
a royal bearing.

365
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,674
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Let me get a pack of gum.

366
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,029
Can I get a pack of gum, please?

367
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,952
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty...

368
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,839
...but we don't accept bills
with lipstick on the president.

369
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,273
What?

370
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,879
So I had it all along.
How do you like that?

371
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,838
I guess I owe that cashier
an apology.

372
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,555
Oh, my God.

373
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,595
No, no, Deena,
it's not what you think.

374
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,228
This isn't mine.
I got it from the Institute.

375
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,550
The Institute!

376
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,234
Mr. Haarwood.

377
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,789
Well, you certainly know
how to dress for a premiere.

378
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,109
Well, thank you.

379
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,989
- Where is your friend, King Henry?
- He ran away.

380
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,233
- Hey, Kramer.
- Let me talk to you.

381
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,994
You know, that button
looks very familiar.

382
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,196
Yes, it's antique ivory.

383
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,679
I think that's my button.

384
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,671
You know, I've been
looking all over for it.

385
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,110
- Did you find it here?
- It was in the lost and found.

386
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,753
- Shall I undo it?
- Yes, of course.

387
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,912
- Oh, thank you.
- I'm a little ticklish.

388
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,752
Tickle, tickle.

389
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,635
We really gotta get
that Elaine a boyfriend.

390
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,597
Oh, tell me about it.
