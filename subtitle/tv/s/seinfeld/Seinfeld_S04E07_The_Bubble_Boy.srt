1
00:00:03,578 --> 00:00:06,411
Ever called someone and were
disappointed when they answered?

2
00:00:06,581 --> 00:00:08,674
You wanted the machine.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,147
You're always thrown off.

4
00:00:10,318 --> 00:00:14,084
You go, "Oh, l... I didn't know
you were there.

5
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:18,919
I just wanted to leave a message
saying, 'Sorry I missed you."'

6
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:22,824
So here's two people who hate each
other, don't really ever wanna talk...

7
00:00:23,097 --> 00:00:26,294
...but the phone machine
is like this relationship respirator...

8
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:29,163
...keeping these marginal,
brain-dead relationships alive.

9
00:00:29,337 --> 00:00:33,899
We do it so when we come home,
you can see the little flashing red light.

10
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,702
You go, "All right, messages."

11
00:00:35,877 --> 00:00:37,868
You see, people need that.

12
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:41,345
It's very important for human beings
to feel popular and well-liked...

13
00:00:41,516 --> 00:00:43,950
...amongst a large group of people
we don't care for.

14
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:54,789
Well, this is it.

15
00:00:54,963 --> 00:00:56,624
Oh, this is nice.

16
00:00:56,798 --> 00:00:59,596
- Thanks again for the Chinese food.
- Oh, you're welcome.

17
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:02,531
- I think I ate too much of that garlic.
- Me too.

18
00:01:02,737 --> 00:01:06,537
I ate the whole plate. I didn't know.
I thought they were peanuts.

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,947
You know what, I think Naked Gun
is on. Oh, I've seen it.

20
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:17,276
I laughed through that whole thing.
Wanna watch?

21
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:18,851
No.

22
00:01:19,187 --> 00:01:21,712
- I mean, I don't think so.
- I thought you liked to laugh.

23
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:23,356
I thought you were
happy-go-lucky.

24
00:01:23,524 --> 00:01:28,552
No, no. I'm not happy,
I'm not lucky, and I don't go.

25
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,855
If anything, I'm sad-stop-unlucky.

26
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,201
That's not funny, Naomi.
I didn't mean to be funny there.

27
00:01:35,737 --> 00:01:39,468
Why don't you check the TV Guide?
I think Holocaust is on.

28
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:46,938
Jerry, it's George. You all set for the
weekend? This is gonna be great.

29
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:48,776
You'll have a great time with Naomi.

30
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,747
All right, she's got that laugh.

31
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:54,251
What'd you say, it's like Elmer Fudd
sitting on a juicer?

32
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,855
I was thinking we'd take two cars
up to the cabin.

33
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:59,289
That way, you know, if one of us
wanted to stay...

34
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,128
This thing has never worked right.

35
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:08,902
You think I laugh like Elmer Fudd
sitting on a juicer?

36
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,665
Well, first of all, Elmer Fudd
is one of the most beloved...

37
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,173
...internationally known
cartoon characters of all time.

38
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,902
"I'm gonna kill that cwazy wabbit."

39
00:02:18,746 --> 00:02:23,547
Come on! Not only that, a juicer
is one of the healthiest ways...

40
00:02:23,718 --> 00:02:28,348
It makes juice, it extracts the pulp
and... And then the vitamins.

41
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,619
For long life and vitality.

42
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,288
How could you leave
a message like that?

43
00:02:36,464 --> 00:02:38,193
How could you play it to just anyone?

44
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,731
I didn't think you'd leave it.

45
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:43,132
- I didn't think you'd play it.
- Now she's not coming this weekend.

46
00:02:43,304 --> 00:02:46,137
What do you mean, not going?
We got plans. Call her up.

47
00:02:46,307 --> 00:02:47,899
Ah, it's better anyway.

48
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:50,169
I mean, really.
What was gonna happen?

49
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:53,711
I'm a comedian. How can I go out
with a girl with a laugh like that?

50
00:02:54,415 --> 00:02:57,543
It's like Coco Chanel going out
with a fishmonger.

51
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:03,513
You know, she's with all the perfumes,
and a fishmonger's a pretty bad smell.

52
00:03:07,195 --> 00:03:08,719
Well, maybe you should ask Elaine.

53
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:11,160
But if I ask Elaine,
Kramer will feel slighted.

54
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:15,029
Oh, no, no. Don't say anything
to Kramer. Susan can't stand him.

55
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:17,728
He vomited all over her.

56
00:03:19,107 --> 00:03:21,541
Wait a minute. Do you smell smoke?

57
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:24,439
- Ah, Kramer.
- Hello, boys.

58
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:26,273
Top of the morning to you.

59
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:28,176
What do you say? What do you be?

60
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:30,743
Put that thing out before you start
another fire.

61
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:32,408
You had to give him cigars.

62
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,784
So, what are you guys
doing this weekend?

63
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,691
- Ah, we're...
- Because I'm gonna be playing golf...

64
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,454
...at the Westchester Country Club.

65
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:43,494
Westchester? Isn't that a private club?

66
00:03:43,664 --> 00:03:47,395
That's right, buddy.
It's private. It's very private.

67
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:52,237
I met the pro at the golf shop up on
49th Street. I gave him a Cuban...

68
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:54,397
...and he invites me for a free round.

69
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:58,841
Then he says, anytime I lay one of
these on him, it'll be the same deal.

70
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:00,503
- Wow.
- Isn't that beautiful?

71
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:03,149
Man, I'm gonna be hitting
the links all weekend.

72
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,487
- Gee, that's... That's too bad.
- Yeah. Too bad.

73
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,951
- Why? What? What?
- Because we were just saying...

74
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,184
...we were gonna ask you
to the country.

75
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:16,421
Susan's father has a cabin up there,
but all right.

76
00:04:16,597 --> 00:04:18,360
They got any
golf courses up there?

77
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:20,797
No, no, no.

78
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:23,232
- No, no, that's pie country.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:23,404 --> 00:04:25,497
Yeah, they do a lot of baking up there.

80
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:27,868
They sell them by the road.
Blueberry, blackberry.

81
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:30,237
- Blackberry, boysenberry.
- Boysenberry, huckleberry.

82
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:32,504
- Raspberry, strawberry.
- Strawberry, cranberry.

83
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,307
Peach.

84
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:40,184
- I don't know.
- Come on, I don't wanna tag along...

85
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:42,914
...with George and Susan.
With you, it's a better group.

86
00:04:43,357 --> 00:04:45,723
- What's that?
- Oh, it's an autographed picture...

87
00:04:45,893 --> 00:04:48,987
...for my dry cleaner. I never know
what to write on these things.

88
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,028
I hate doing this.

89
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,999
"I'm very impressed"?

90
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,496
You mean "pressed"
because it's a dry cleaner?

91
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,869
Yeah, see? That's why I hate it.

92
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:04,034
So come on, you wanna go?

93
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,171
Well, what about the sleeping
arrangements in the cabin?

94
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:14,385
Well... Same bed,
and underwear and a T-shirt.

95
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:17,956
- What about me?
- Well, you'd be naked, of course.

96
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:23,192
- Excuse me. Jerry Seinfeld?
- Yeah.

97
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:27,095
My names Sanger, Mel Sanger.
I drive that truck out there.

98
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:29,030
- The Yoo-hoo?
- Yeah.

99
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:32,036
- I love Yoo-hoo.
- Yes, it's a fine product.

100
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,674
I saw you on The Tonight Show
a couple of weeks ago.

101
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:37,140
I was watching the show
with my son Donald.

102
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:40,144
He's got this rare immune deficiency
in his blood.

103
00:05:40,314 --> 00:05:44,148
The damnedest thing. Doctors say
he has to live in a plastic bubble.

104
00:05:44,318 --> 00:05:45,979
Can you imagine that? A bubble.

105
00:05:46,153 --> 00:05:47,882
- A bubble?
- A bubble?

106
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:49,886
Yes, a bubble.

107
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:52,557
- Do you mind? May I?
- Oh, sure.

108
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,456
It'd break your heart
seeing him in there.

109
00:05:57,632 --> 00:06:01,591
He's like a prisoner.
No friends. Just his mother and me.

110
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:04,966
And I'm out there six days
a week hauling Yoo-hoo.

111
00:06:05,973 --> 00:06:09,966
We have sacrificed everything,
all for the sake of our little...

112
00:06:10,144 --> 00:06:12,339
...bubble boy.

113
00:06:12,847 --> 00:06:15,873
- Excuse me.
- Oh, here.

114
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,060
Excuse me.

115
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:29,924
Anyway, we were watching
you on TV...

116
00:06:30,097 --> 00:06:31,564
You get in the bubble with him?

117
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:33,927
No. He can see through the bubble,
it's plastic.

118
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:38,060
- Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
- No. It's clear.

119
00:06:38,406 --> 00:06:39,930
Who has the remote?

120
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:41,540
He does.

121
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,609
The remote goes through the bubble?

122
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,804
Yeah. He's in the bubble
with the remote.

123
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:49,176
So you have no control
over the remote?

124
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,284
No. It's frustrating.

125
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,444
Yeah. Of course. Yeah.

126
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,817
So anyway,
you're his favorite comedian.

127
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:58,652
He laughed so hard the other night...

128
00:06:58,826 --> 00:07:01,056
...we had to give him
an extra shot of hemoglobin.

129
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:03,796
That's nice.

130
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:05,658
Tomorrow is his birthday.

131
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:09,963
And it would mean so much to him
if you could find it in your heart...

132
00:07:10,137 --> 00:07:14,301
...to pay him a visit and just say hello.
- Oh, well, tomorrow, l...

133
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:18,138
Jerry. Of course he'd pay him a visit.
You'd be happy to.

134
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:21,012
Yeah. Okay...

135
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:24,345
Tomorrow. Where do you live?
Uptown? Up Westside?

136
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:27,583
- No. Upstate.
- Upstate.

137
00:07:31,258 --> 00:07:33,317
He's a bubble boy!

138
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:37,326
- A bubble boy?
- Yes, a bubble boy.

139
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,763
- What's a bubble boy?
- He lives in a bubble.

140
00:07:41,202 --> 00:07:42,601
Boy.

141
00:07:45,573 --> 00:07:47,700
What kind of a bubble, like an igloo?

142
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:51,777
No, that's what I thought. It's
a piece of plastic dividing the room.

143
00:07:52,613 --> 00:07:55,810
What kind of plastic do you think it is?
Like that dry-cleaning plastic?

144
00:07:55,983 --> 00:07:57,883
That's no good.

145
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:00,247
He wouldn't last 10 minutes in there.

146
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:02,987
What can I do?
I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.

147
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:05,022
It's his birthday.
I can't go to the cabin.

148
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:08,525
- Well, where does he live?
- I don't know. Upstate. Fall-something.

149
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,597
Wait a minute. This is right
on the way to the cabin.

150
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:15,827
Oh, all right. Beautiful. So you stop in,
visit the bubble boy for 20 minutes...

151
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:17,630
...then we can go.
- You think so?

152
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:20,706
I know exactly where this is.
You can just follow us.

153
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,036
Oh, great. Okay, we're going away.

154
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,701
- I think I'm excited.
- I'm excited.

155
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,338
Oh, you're gonna love this cabin.
My grandfather built it in 1947.

156
00:08:29,517 --> 00:08:32,918
- It's incredible.
- There you go. It's a '47 cabin.

157
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:35,950
- So we'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

158
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:38,123
Well, hey.

159
00:08:38,359 --> 00:08:40,486
Very nice. Very nice.

160
00:08:41,996 --> 00:08:43,793
- Well, I'm off to the links.
- Yeah.

161
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:45,761
I wanna thank you
for the invite upstate.

162
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:47,161
I'm sorry I can't make it.

163
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:49,393
- The what?
- Nothing. Let's get going. Come on.

164
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,663
- Did you...?
- No, no, we'll talk about it later.

165
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,637
Is that one of the cigars
my father gave you?

166
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:01,648
Hey, what's with George and Susan?
Does he actually like her?

167
00:09:01,816 --> 00:09:05,343
I don't know if he likes her
as much as he likes it.

168
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:07,143
Oh, that's nice.

169
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:09,380
What's he doing? What is his hurry?

170
00:09:09,557 --> 00:09:12,321
Oh, you know George.
He's gotta make "good time."

171
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:16,190
He once went from West 81 st St.
to Kennedy airport in 25 minutes.

172
00:09:16,363 --> 00:09:18,092
I never heard the end of it.

173
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,990
Look at him.

174
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:22,628
Would you stop that, please?
Just stop that.

175
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:25,897
- Why?
- Knock it off. You're distracting me.

176
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:28,200
We're making incredible time here.

177
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:33,335
I once made it to Kennedy airport
from West 81 St. in 15 minutes.

178
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,314
Oh, here. Hold this.
It's $ 10 for the tolls.

179
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,680
What's he doing?
Is he out of his mind?

180
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:41,681
Do you see him? I don't even
see him anymore. Where is he?

181
00:09:42,223 --> 00:09:44,555
- Isn't that blue car him?
- No, no, that's not him.

182
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:47,819
What happened to him?
I can't believe it. I lost him.

183
00:09:47,995 --> 00:09:49,485
That stupid idiot.

184
00:09:49,663 --> 00:09:51,961
- Now what are we gonna do?
- It's no big deal, Jerry.

185
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,158
We'll just meet him
at the bubble boy's house.

186
00:09:54,335 --> 00:09:56,360
I don't even know
where the bubble boy lives.

187
00:09:56,537 --> 00:09:58,801
I don't even remember the name
of the town.

188
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,498
- You don't have the directions?
- No, I was following him!

189
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:03,404
How could you not take the directions?

190
00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:05,807
Because he's my directions.

191
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,217
I don't see them, George.

192
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,851
You make plans,
then he goes 100 miles an hour...

193
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:16,012
...the weekend's over just like that.

194
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:17,919
Poor little bubble boy.

195
00:10:18,092 --> 00:10:21,584
He's sitting there waiting for you
in his bubble or igloo thing, whatever.

196
00:10:21,762 --> 00:10:24,253
I don't know what to do.
I don't know where I am.

197
00:10:24,598 --> 00:10:27,795
Just get off at this exit.
We'll figure something out.

198
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:31,667
We lost them. Do you know that?
We lost them.

199
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,067
Well, it's not my fault.

200
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,902
Seinfeld can't drive.
How hard is it to follow somebody?

201
00:10:36,076 --> 00:10:38,135
Well, now what are you gonna do?

202
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,174
It's fine. We'll just meet him
at the bubble boy's house.

203
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:43,507
Does he have the address?

204
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:52,158
Yeah.

205
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,425
Leave a message,
I'll call you back. Thanks.

206
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:03,035
Hi, Jerry. It's Naomi.

207
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:06,332
Listen, if it's not too late,
I changed my mind.

208
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:09,567
- I'd like to go to the cabin.
- Wait. Wait.

209
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:12,143
Yeah, hello. Hi.

210
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:14,073
This is Kramer.

211
00:11:14,348 --> 00:11:16,748
Yeah. I'm the next-door neighbor.

212
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:21,881
You know, Jerry's left, but listen,
you see, my golf game got canceled.

213
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,887
I'm thinking of going up myself.

214
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,391
They got pies,
and I got the directions right here.

215
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,932
I drive all the way
to the country club...

216
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:37,627
...and then I find out
there's a tournament going on.

217
00:11:38,138 --> 00:11:40,368
- You mind if I smoke?
- No.

218
00:11:40,541 --> 00:11:42,133
These are Cubans.

219
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,885
I don't know if this is the house.

220
00:11:56,056 --> 00:11:58,422
I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.

221
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:01,959
Would you stop it?

222
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:04,654
Would you quit it, please?
Someone is gonna see us here.

223
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:06,493
So what?

224
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:09,033
You are such a prude.

225
00:12:09,203 --> 00:12:11,728
Hey. I am not a prude, sweetheart.

226
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:14,601
I swing with the best of them.

227
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,843
- Come on, let's go in.
- What?

228
00:12:17,011 --> 00:12:20,310
We should tell them what happened.
They might be very late...

229
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:23,075
...if they make it all.
- I can't go in there.

230
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:24,951
I can't face the bubble boy.

231
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:29,718
- What's the matter?
- I don't react well to these situations.

232
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:33,824
My grandmother died two months early
from how I reacted in the hospital.

233
00:12:33,994 --> 00:12:36,121
She was getting better.
Then I paid her a visit.

234
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,857
She saw my face, boom.
That was the end of her.

235
00:12:39,033 --> 00:12:40,500
- We're going in.
- Wait, please...

236
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:43,535
- Come on, George. George, stop.
- Would you wait one moment...

237
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,666
I can't believe a little thing
like George speeding...

238
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:53,074
...and my whole weekend is gone.
The plans, the packing. Everything.

239
00:12:53,247 --> 00:12:55,841
Your whole weekend?
What about the bubble boy?

240
00:12:56,016 --> 00:12:57,881
Why do you keep bringing up
the bubble boy?

241
00:12:58,052 --> 00:13:00,816
You don't have to mention him.
I know about the bubble boy.

242
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,478
I'm aware of the bubble boy.

243
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,716
Why do you keep reminding me
about the bubble boy?

244
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:12,225
I'll have a cup of coffee
and a turkey club.

245
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,061
- How about you?
- I'll just have a glass of water.

246
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:18,904
You can't just have water.

247
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:21,098
Why not? That's all I want.

248
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:23,743
This isn't a park bench
where you come in and sit down.

249
00:13:23,911 --> 00:13:25,469
It's a business.

250
00:13:27,581 --> 00:13:29,173
Hold it a second.

251
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,908
Don't you play on TV?

252
00:13:31,985 --> 00:13:35,580
- Oh, no.
- Yes. Yes, you saw him on TV.

253
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,082
- What's your name?
- Jerry Seinfeld.

254
00:13:38,258 --> 00:13:41,284
- Elaine...
- Gary Seinfield.

255
00:13:41,462 --> 00:13:43,692
- I saw you on The Tonight Show.
- Right.

256
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,695
Wouldn't you like
an autographed picture?

257
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,995
I don't have any more pictures, Elaine.

258
00:13:49,169 --> 00:13:51,535
He's lying. They're in the trunk.

259
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,538
- Now you get to sign another one.
- I'm not lying.

260
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,608
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

261
00:13:57,578 --> 00:14:00,513
She'll have a cup of coffee
and a broiled chicken.

262
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:06,317
See, it's not really a bubble.

263
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:11,389
A lot of people think it's an igloo,
but it's really just a plastic divider.

264
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:23,464
Can you go in the bubble?

265
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:26,834
Well, you have to put so many things
on because of the germs.

266
00:14:27,007 --> 00:14:29,737
The gloves, the mask,
it's a whole production.

267
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:32,008
So then he makes his own bed?

268
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:35,577
Well, that's one of the things
we fight about.

269
00:14:36,683 --> 00:14:37,911
Would you like to meet him?

270
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:40,985
- Ah, well, you know...
- Oh, he loves games.

271
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,246
Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit
with him.

272
00:14:43,624 --> 00:14:47,424
Hey, Ma! What the hell do I gotta
do to get some food around here?

273
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:51,687
I'm starving. And if it's peanut butter,
I'm gonna shove it in your face!

274
00:14:59,473 --> 00:15:03,967
- One picture left in the trunk.
- Thanks. This is fun.

275
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:06,602
Yeah, this turned out to be
a great weekend.

276
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,338
Where's my water?

277
00:15:08,515 --> 00:15:10,847
Oh, it's coming.

278
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:13,652
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

279
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,816
What'd you write?

280
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:18,514
"Nothing's finer
than being in your diner."

281
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:28,191
There is "nothing finer than being
in your diner"?

282
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:31,360
- No good?
- This is what you came up with?

283
00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:33,028
Well?

284
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:34,936
That is so lame, Jerry.

285
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:38,874
People will be reading that for the
next 20 years and laughing at you.

286
00:15:39,246 --> 00:15:42,044
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

287
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:44,241
Would you mind?
I'd like the picture back.

288
00:15:44,418 --> 00:15:46,852
- Why?
- I'm not happy with what I wrote.

289
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:49,955
- It's good. I like it.
- No, believe me, it's not good.

290
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:52,216
I'll mail you one with something
really funny.

291
00:15:52,392 --> 00:15:55,156
Well, when you mail me a new one,
I'll send you back this one.

292
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,661
You don't understand.
I want the picture.

293
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,230
Right.

294
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:09,472
This is Donald.

295
00:16:09,643 --> 00:16:10,871
- Hi.
- Hello.

296
00:16:11,044 --> 00:16:12,272
Who are you?

297
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:14,937
- Where's Seinfeld?
- He's on his way.

298
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:16,605
These are his friends.

299
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,579
What are you looking at?

300
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:21,346
Never seen a kid in a bubble before?

301
00:16:24,658 --> 00:16:27,286
Of course I have. Come on.

302
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:30,259
My cousin's in a bubble.

303
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:34,656
My friend Jeffrey's sister also,
bubble, you know...

304
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:37,462
I got a lot of bubble experience.
Come on.

305
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:42,071
- What's your story?
- I have no story.

306
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:44,369
She works for NBC.

307
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,911
How about taking your top off?

308
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,713
Donald, behave yourself.

309
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,511
Come on.

310
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:54,381
I know, I know.

311
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,819
Why don't you play
a game of Trivial Pursuit?

312
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,821
Ah, you know, we gotta be running...

313
00:16:58,992 --> 00:17:00,687
What, are you afraid?

314
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:05,591
- No. You see, it's...
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

315
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:08,832
I was nice enough
to give you the picture.

316
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:12,733
I don't like what I wrote. I don't want
it up there. Please just give it back.

317
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,808
You are really starting
to get under my skin.

318
00:17:15,976 --> 00:17:18,638
- I want that picture.
- Well, you can't have it.

319
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:21,576
In fact, maybe you better
just pay your check, and get out.

320
00:17:21,748 --> 00:17:23,807
I'm not paying until I get that back.

321
00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:25,849
Well, you ain't getting it back.

322
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:28,783
Well, maybe I'll just take it back.

323
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,091
This chicken is really good.

324
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:38,361
Okay, history.

325
00:17:38,532 --> 00:17:40,261
This is for the game.

326
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,567
How you doing over there?

327
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:45,337
Not too good.

328
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,399
All right, bubble boy.

329
00:17:48,575 --> 00:17:50,566
Let's just play.

330
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:54,043
"Who invaded Spain
in the eighth century?"

331
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:56,307
That's a joke. The Moors.

332
00:17:56,483 --> 00:17:58,576
Oh, no.

333
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:01,213
I'm so sorry. It's the "Moops."

334
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:03,583
The correct answer is the Moops.

335
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:06,783
Moops? Let me see that.

336
00:18:08,028 --> 00:18:10,622
That's not Moops, you jerk.

337
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,061
It's Moors. It's a misprint.

338
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:16,634
I'm sorry. The card says Moops.

339
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:23,338
It doesn't matter. It's Moors.
There's no Moops.

340
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,841
- It's Moops.
- Moors.

341
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:30,273
- Moops.
- Moors!

342
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:35,777
Hey!

343
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:37,746
Anybody home?

344
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:42,493
- Oh, boy.
- What should we do?

345
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,796
Hold these pies.

346
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,324
Okay.

347
00:18:58,211 --> 00:18:59,542
Help. Someone...

348
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:02,807
- There's no Moops, you idiot!
- Stop it! Let go of him.

349
00:19:02,983 --> 00:19:06,146
Donald. Stop it.
Now, let go of him, Donald.

350
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,913
- I'm gonna kill him.
- He's choking me.

351
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:10,954
- Donald. Stop.
- Moors!

352
00:19:11,124 --> 00:19:12,523
Say Moors!

353
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,217
Moops. Moops.

354
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:16,328
Donald, stop it.

355
00:19:26,306 --> 00:19:28,331
What are you doing?
You're choking me. Elaine!

356
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:31,568
- Are you gonna pay today?
- No, I want that picture back!

357
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:33,474
Something's happened
to the bubble boy!

358
00:19:33,647 --> 00:19:35,410
- They're rushing him to hospital.
- What?

359
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:37,880
The bubble boy?
He lives around here?

360
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,484
That's his house, down the road.

361
00:19:39,653 --> 00:19:41,177
He got in a fight with some guy.

362
00:19:41,354 --> 00:19:43,652
Who kind of a person would hurt
the bubble boy?

363
00:19:43,824 --> 00:19:45,951
Some little bald guy from the city.

364
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:50,460
Come on, Vern. Page, Preston, don't
you think we ought to do something?

365
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,858
Naomi, come on, let's get going.

366
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:57,003
But that lake must be freezing.

367
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,797
No, it's good for you.

368
00:19:58,972 --> 00:20:01,065
Retards the aging process.

369
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:08,005
Ready to go swimming?

370
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:09,580
Let's go.

371
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,978
Okay.

372
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,690
Jerry, what happened to you?

373
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:24,296
What happened to you?
You were going 100 miles an hour.

374
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:26,193
I was not.
Bubble boy tried to kill me.

375
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:27,958
- What?
- Susan, tell them.

376
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:30,399
It's a long story.

377
00:20:31,338 --> 00:20:34,068
- Hey, Seinfeld.
- Hey, happy birthday.

378
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:35,640
Thanks for showing up.

379
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:38,505
- You know, your friend tried to kill me.
- He's a lying snot.

380
00:20:38,678 --> 00:20:40,612
He's a cheater, aren't you,
little twerp?

381
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,112
- Moors!
- Moops!

382
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:44,317
- Moors!
- Moops!

383
00:20:44,484 --> 00:20:47,885
There's the guy who tried to kill
the bubble boy. Get him!

384
00:20:57,497 --> 00:20:59,488
Fire engines.

385
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:04,426
Must be a big one.

386
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:09,909
Do you smell something?

387
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,667
- Yeah.
- Smoke.

388
00:21:11,845 --> 00:21:13,972
Yeah. Definite smoke.

389
00:21:14,948 --> 00:21:16,643
Look, it's a fire!

390
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,484
Holy cow, look at that!

391
00:21:19,753 --> 00:21:23,245
- It's my father's cabin!
- The cabin is on fire.

392
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:29,261
I just realized, you never gave
me back the change from the tolls.

393
00:21:31,097 --> 00:21:33,258
How could this have happened?

394
00:21:36,603 --> 00:21:37,934
Oh, my God. The cabin.

395
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:39,469
What are you two doing here?

396
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:41,163
Look at that.

397
00:21:42,976 --> 00:21:44,568
Hey, you didn't:

398
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:47,479
My Cubans.

399
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:52,883
Something very scary
and exciting about fire.

400
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:54,520
People always run to see a fire.

401
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:57,521
They're very proud
if they have a fireplace.

402
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,057
I think that's what smoking
is really all about.

403
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:02,491
That's the power of smoking.
It's just this thing:

404
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:05,028
"I got fire right here in my hand.

405
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:09,131
Smoke and fire is literally
coming right out of my mouth."

406
00:22:09,302 --> 00:22:11,361
And it's very intimidating
to the nonsmoker.

407
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,062
It's like talking to someone going:

408
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,299
"My head could open up.
Lava could explode out.

409
00:22:15,475 --> 00:22:18,501
Pour right down my face.
Doesn't bother me a bit."

410
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,645
And a cigar is even worse.

411
00:22:20,814 --> 00:22:22,338
I mean, a cigar is like:

412
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:27,043
You think this end is bad.
Look at this wet, disgusting nub, huh?

413
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,620
How scary is that?
