1
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:06,652
In parking lots, they have this
"compact car only" spot.

2
00:00:06,816 --> 00:00:09,499
Isn't that discrimination
against the size of your car?

3
00:00:09,654 --> 00:00:12,643
If I want my ass hanging out
of the back of my parking spot...

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,905
...that's my business.

5
00:00:15,063 --> 00:00:17,551
There are people with real asses
hanging out of their pants.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,433
Nobody's stopping them.

7
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:23,381
Nobody goes, " Hey, hold it, sir.
Those are compact jeans.

8
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,450
You can't pull that in there."

9
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,082
Hey.

10
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:35,656
I got bad news for you, buddy.

11
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:37,648
I think your car got stolen again.

12
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,185
What are you talking about?

13
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:40,948
You parked on 84th
and Columbus, right?

14
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:44,513
I just walked by there,
and that car is gone.

15
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:46,085
Yeah, I know.

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,471
Well, where is it?

17
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:48,733
What's the difference?

18
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:51,766
Well, there's no difference.
You know, I'm just curious.

19
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,338
Always have to know everything
that's going on, don't you?

20
00:00:54,497 --> 00:00:57,977
- What happened to the car?
- lf I don't tell you, it'll kill you, won't it?

21
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,017
- Yeah, yeah. It'll kill me.
- You have to know.

22
00:01:00,174 --> 00:01:02,934
- You must know.
- I must know.

23
00:01:04,394 --> 00:01:05,888
Well, I'm not telling you.

24
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:07,308
Come on.

25
00:01:07,463 --> 00:01:08,685
Nope. I don't think so.

26
00:01:08,844 --> 00:01:11,255
- Well, please?
- Not today, pal.

27
00:01:11,414 --> 00:01:12,559
Okay, I beg you.

28
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:15,862
Now, see, just saying "beg"
doesn't make it a real beg.

29
00:01:16,017 --> 00:01:17,315
You gotta put some beg into it.

30
00:01:17,475 --> 00:01:20,344
Okay. Please!
Please tell me!

31
00:01:21,234 --> 00:01:23,219
All right, but your begging
needs a lot of work.

32
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:26,328
- Okay, okay. What is it?
- I loaned the car to George.

33
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:28,245
George. All right.

34
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:30,055
Well, what for?

35
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:33,966
George and Elaine went to
a flea market in Westchester. Okay?

36
00:01:34,123 --> 00:01:35,726
All right.

37
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:39,181
Why'd they go there?

38
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,943
Would you stop it, already?

39
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:42,980
- Why didn't they ask me to go?
- I don't know!

40
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:45,167
How am I supposed to know?

41
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:48,354
- What, they don't like me?
- I don't like you.

42
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,766
Well, if they liked me,
why didn't they ask me to go?

43
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:53,223
Yeah.

44
00:01:59,594 --> 00:02:01,579
I really think it looks good.

45
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:03,957
Ten bucks.
How can you go wrong?

46
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,150
All bald people look good in hats.

47
00:02:06,345 --> 00:02:09,978
You should have lived in the '20s and
'30s. Men wore hats all the time then.

48
00:02:10,143 --> 00:02:12,434
What a bald paradise
that must have been.

49
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:14,241
Nobody knew.

50
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:16,892
You can wear a hat all the time now.

51
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:19,033
- Who's stopping you?
- No, I can't.

52
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,647
What if I meet a woman?

53
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,447
I'd always worry about that first
moment where I take it off...

54
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:26,444
...and see that look of disappointment
on her face.

55
00:02:26,906 --> 00:02:28,859
You sure you like
these sunglasses?

56
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,454
Man.

57
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:35,801
Well, I'm very disappointed
in George and Elaine.

58
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,254
And you know I'm somebody you don't
wanna have on your bad side.

59
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,208
- Why not?
- Because I'm like ice, buddy.

60
00:02:42,365 --> 00:02:44,013
When I don't like you,
you got problems.

61
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:50,836
- Is this for the fight?
- Yeah. Starts in 35 minutes.

62
00:02:55,446 --> 00:02:56,624
Yeah.

63
00:02:56,942 --> 00:02:59,201
Hey, I invited Mike Moffett.
You don't mind, do you?

64
00:02:59,742 --> 00:03:01,084
No. I like Mike.

65
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:04,607
I just got off the phone with him.
We had a great conversation.

66
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:08,564
- Yeah? What did you talk about?
- Actually, we talked about you.

67
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:12,398
Yeah. He had some pretty
interesting things to say.

68
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:14,732
Yeah? What did he say?

69
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,350
You have to know everything,
don't you?

70
00:03:18,194 --> 00:03:19,764
- Come on. What'd he say?
- Why is that?

71
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,600
Why do you have
to know everything?

72
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:24,401
- Kramer, just tell me what he said.
- Beg me.

73
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:27,773
- Please don't make me beg.
- No, I want you to beg me.

74
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:31,111
And I don't want you to say it. I want
you to put some beg in it. Go on.

75
00:03:31,274 --> 00:03:33,456
Kramer, please tell me
what the guy said.

76
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:35,490
No, no. That's no good.

77
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:37,480
No, I really don't think that's a beg.

78
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:39,704
No way. It's close, but...

79
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:42,125
- Kramer!
- Look, I can't say anything.

80
00:03:42,284 --> 00:03:45,076
The guy told me this stuff in
confidence. I'd be betraying a friend.

81
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:47,529
Well, you can't just mention it
and then not tell me.

82
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:50,525
All right. I'll tell you,
but you can't say anything to him.

83
00:03:50,685 --> 00:03:52,823
I'm not saying anything.
I'm putting it in the vault.

84
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:54,971
I'm locking the vault.
It's a vault!

85
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,894
- He thinks you're a phoney.
- He what?

86
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,850
I told you. He thinks you're a phoney.

87
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:02,723
- A phoney? He called me a phoney?
- A big phoney.

88
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:04,639
Big one.

89
00:04:05,223 --> 00:04:08,016
Why did you tell me that
if I can't say anything?

90
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:09,703
You begged me.

91
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:14,764
Do you hear that?

92
00:04:14,928 --> 00:04:16,499
Of course I hear that.

93
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:18,148
You had to move the mirror.

94
00:04:18,304 --> 00:04:19,875
I wanted to check out
my sunglasses.

95
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,899
Went to look in the mirror, it was gone.
You threw off my equilibrium.

96
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,930
Yeah. Blame it on me
because you can't drive, George.

97
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:27,618
- I can't drive?
- Yeah.

98
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:29,459
Nobody drives like me. Nobody.

99
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,227
I'm doing things in this car,
you have no idea they're going on.

100
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:34,138
Want to see a right turn
from the left lane?

101
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,903
No, I really don't.

102
00:04:36,563 --> 00:04:39,171
- I can make a left from the right lane.
- I'm sure you could.

103
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,037
- What are we gonna tell Jerry?
- I don't know.

104
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:43,696
Start looking for spaces.

105
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:46,917
You're never gonna find a space on
Jerry's block. Just put it in a garage.

106
00:04:47,074 --> 00:04:49,910
Look, I have my system.
First, I look for the dream spot...

107
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:53,513
...in front of the door, then I slowly
expand out in concentric circles.

108
00:04:53,672 --> 00:04:56,083
No. Come on, George.
Please put it in a garage.

109
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:58,456
I don't wanna spend an hour
looking for a space.

110
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,343
I can't park in a garage.

111
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,485
- Why?
- I don't know. I just can't.

112
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:05,103
Nobody in my family can pay
for parking. It's a sickness.

113
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,890
My father never paid for parking.
My mother. My brother. Nobody.

114
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:11,847
- I'll pay for it.
- You don't understand.

115
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:14,192
A garage.

116
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:15,919
I can't even pull in there.

117
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:17,721
It's like going to a prostitute.

118
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:22,546
Why should I pay when, if I apply
myself, maybe I could get it for free?

119
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:25,193
What? What do you want?

120
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:27,841
Go around me.
I'm looking for spaces.

121
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:29,575
George! There's
a space right there!

122
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,606
- Beautiful.
- You just passed it, see?

123
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:35,631
Look at that, the dream space.
Right in front of Jerry's building.

124
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,082
Dreams can come true.
What did I tell you?

125
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:40,809
You didn't even have to
take it out to dinner.

126
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:47,291
All right, now you're gonna see
some parallel parking.

127
00:05:47,606 --> 00:05:51,163
I wish you could make a living
parallel parking.

128
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:54,807
It's all geometry,
knowing all the angles...

129
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,110
...when to make that first turn
and when to...

130
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,029
...swing it back in.
That's the key.

131
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:00,838
Will you just park it, already?

132
00:06:00,993 --> 00:06:03,449
There's nothing I can impart to you.
That's the sad thing.

133
00:06:03,602 --> 00:06:05,402
It's so inborn.

134
00:06:05,558 --> 00:06:07,314
I can't pass it on.

135
00:06:09,394 --> 00:06:10,813
Look at this guy.

136
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:13,334
What, are you crazy?
What are you doing?

137
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:16,101
Hey, hey! You're stealing
my space!

138
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:17,908
Wait, you don't know who this guy is!

139
00:06:18,064 --> 00:06:20,049
People kill for a parking space
in this city.

140
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:22,350
- He's not getting away with this.
- George!

141
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,041
What are you doing?

142
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:25,576
I think I'm parking my car.

143
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:28,496
You can't do that. You can't sneak
in from the back like that.

144
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:30,102
I'm not sneaking!

145
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:32,945
I didn't even know you were parking.
You were just sitting there.

146
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,938
If you didn't think I was parking,
why did you put it in headfirst?

147
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:37,544
That's the way I park!

148
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:40,226
You didn't start backing in
until I pulled in.

149
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:42,069
I was in the middle of a conversation.

150
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,605
Hey, buddy, what can I tell you?

151
00:06:43,765 --> 00:06:45,292
The point is, I was here first.

152
00:06:45,453 --> 00:06:47,133
I was closer to this space
than you were!

153
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:49,825
But I'm backing in,
you can't put it in headfirst!

154
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:51,735
I can if I have room!

155
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:54,275
Are you gonna move the car?

156
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:56,115
No, I'm not gonna move the car.

157
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,990
- Jerk.
- You're not?

158
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:02,326
- You believe this guy?
- We'll put it in the garage.

159
00:07:02,485 --> 00:07:04,776
I am not putting it in the garage.
It's my space.

160
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,395
What are you gonna do, you're
gonna leave it here like this?

161
00:07:07,548 --> 00:07:09,577
- I'm going upstairs.
- Are you coming back down?

162
00:07:09,735 --> 00:07:12,265
I gotta tell Jerry we're here.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

163
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,449
Make sure he reserves
the good chair for me.

164
00:07:14,606 --> 00:07:16,897
What are we gonna tell him
about the clanking noise?

165
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:19,201
Me? No, no, no. You.
You're gonna tell him.

166
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:21,425
- I'm not gonna... No!
- You're good at this.

167
00:07:21,588 --> 00:07:23,159
- What am I gonna say?
- I don't know.

168
00:07:23,314 --> 00:07:25,648
You'll think of something.
Just break it to him gently.

169
00:07:25,807 --> 00:07:27,149
Man!

170
00:07:37,776 --> 00:07:40,645
Oh, my God. I need a drink.
Got any Hennigan's here?

171
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:42,377
Yeah. Under the counter.
What happened?

172
00:07:42,532 --> 00:07:47,398
God. Jerry, it was so terrible, what we
just went through on the way home.

173
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:50,011
You wouldn't believe it.

174
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,305
What? Tell me what happened.

175
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,356
Okay. Now listen.

176
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:06,198
We were at the tollbooth at the
Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?

177
00:08:06,354 --> 00:08:08,688
And there were these, like,
this pack...

178
00:08:08,847 --> 00:08:12,983
...of extremely wild teenagers
in a convertible behind us, okay?

179
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:16,362
And for some reason, I don't know,
they just started to taunt us.

180
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,076
And so... So then we paid the toll,
and then we went through...

181
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,888
...and then they started to follow us!

182
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,410
So George tries to lose them,
and... And...

183
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:27,487
But... But they were in this really...
Like a souped-up car, you know?

184
00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:30,404
And so he turned
off the road really suddenly...

185
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:33,810
...and the car was on two wheels,
and I was just screaming...

186
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:36,690
...and then...
George is such a great driver.

187
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,261
- He is?
- He is fantastic.

188
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,028
And then they fired
a gun right up in the air!

189
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:45,357
- A gun?
- I think it was a gun.

190
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,886
And then they followed us
all the way into the city.

191
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:51,804
And then they stopped, and they
turned around and they went home.

192
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:57,133
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

193
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:59,859
- Yeah, yeah. I'm all right. God.
- Oh, man.

194
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:05,079
By the way, the car hit a pothole,
and now it's making a clanking noise.

195
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:08,800
Well, I mean,
as long as you're okay, that...

196
00:09:11,988 --> 00:09:13,744
That's the important thing.

197
00:09:14,213 --> 00:09:15,390
Exactly.

198
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,353
Where's George now?

199
00:09:17,588 --> 00:09:20,884
He's out in front arguing
with some guy about a parking space.

200
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,648
- What are you talking about?
- Look out the window, you'll see.

201
00:09:25,184 --> 00:09:26,481
Hey, Georgie!

202
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:27,786
Hey!

203
00:09:27,946 --> 00:09:29,626
Are you okay?

204
00:09:29,787 --> 00:09:31,009
Yeah. I'm fine.

205
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:33,426
Crazy kids, huh?

206
00:09:33,585 --> 00:09:34,533
What?

207
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,983
It's my cuticle.

208
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:43,902
Is that Jerry?

209
00:09:44,057 --> 00:09:46,348
- Jerry!
- Hey, Mike.

210
00:09:46,665 --> 00:09:47,930
What, you know Jerry?

211
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:50,419
- Yeah, I know Jerry.
- How do you know him?

212
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:52,607
- What's the difference?
- Because I know him too...

213
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:55,939
...and probably a lot better than you.
- Well, bully for you.

214
00:09:56,601 --> 00:10:00,397
Hey, Jerry. You know, your friend
here is a real piece of work!

215
00:10:00,552 --> 00:10:03,235
- I'm coming down.
- Hey, will you tell Kramer I'm outside?

216
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,146
What, you know Kramer?

217
00:10:08,262 --> 00:10:10,673
- Hi.
- Hello.

218
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:23,137
Hey, your friend Mike's outside.
He wants to talk to you.

219
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,247
Hey, Mike!

220
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:28,391
Come on up!
The fight's almost starting.

221
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:31,314
- You're watching the fight at Jerry's?
- Yeah.

222
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,921
Oh, great.

223
00:10:33,158 --> 00:10:35,688
- You know that guy downstairs?
- Yeah. He's a real phoney.

224
00:10:37,607 --> 00:10:38,752
What's going on?

225
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:41,442
Will you come on down?
This guy's in my space!

226
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:42,894
It's my space!

227
00:10:43,055 --> 00:10:44,429
I'll be down in a minute.

228
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:50,025
- Are you going down?
- Yeah.

229
00:10:51,264 --> 00:10:54,711
- Is anything wrong?
- Why should anything be wrong?

230
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:57,470
I'll be down in a minute.

231
00:11:00,547 --> 00:11:01,768
Hey, pal.

232
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:04,529
You're not getting that space.

233
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:07,026
I mean, I'll sleep in my car
if I have to.

234
00:11:08,142 --> 00:11:09,822
I'll die out here.

235
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:12,207
He was down there.

236
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:14,728
Once he passed his front bumper,
it's no longer his space.

237
00:11:14,893 --> 00:11:18,112
- No. It doesn't matter. He was here...
- Hey, Jerry.

238
00:11:18,806 --> 00:11:21,294
- Long time no see.
- Hi, Mike.

239
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:23,024
- Indiana.
- Hey, Krame.

240
00:11:24,368 --> 00:11:27,281
- You know this guy?
- Yeah. Yeah, I know him.

241
00:11:28,012 --> 00:11:29,277
You're looking tremendous.

242
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:30,697
What, are you on some regimen?

243
00:11:30,851 --> 00:11:32,073
Yeah, 25-percent bran flakes.

244
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:34,992
The 40 percent was too much, so I
found a store to make it special.

245
00:11:35,147 --> 00:11:37,252
They take it down
another 15 percent.

246
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,122
That's killer! Killer!

247
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:43,427
I love that.

248
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,344
You've got to use that.
That's a definite.

249
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,875
Come on.

250
00:11:49,034 --> 00:11:50,179
Hey!

251
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:52,630
- Your friend here has real problems.
- Me?

252
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:55,084
See what he did? See how he
tried to sneak into my space?

253
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,775
Going in front-first
isn't sneaking!

254
00:11:56,936 --> 00:11:59,773
You went in front-first
because you saw me backing up!

255
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:03,102
I went front-first because I can make
it front-first. Pull out! I'll show you!

256
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:04,913
You got a prayer.

257
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:06,639
I go in front-first all the time.

258
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:09,741
Front-first. That's how you park
when you're pulling a bank job.

259
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:13,160
- Did you talk to him?
- Yeah.

260
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:16,490
- It's all taken care of.
- You told him? What did you tell him?

261
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,020
I did a number on him.

262
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:22,588
It was a thing of beauty. You really
had to be there to appreciate it.

263
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:24,171
I can't believe it.
What'd you say?

264
00:12:24,325 --> 00:12:29,649
I told him a pack of teenagers
in a convertible were terrorizing us...

265
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,221
...and they followed us into the city.

266
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:33,755
A pack of teenagers?

267
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:35,900
Yeah. By the time
I got to the end of the story...

268
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:39,282
...he was so relieved we were alive,
he couldn't care less about the car.

269
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:42,577
You are a genius.
It's as simple as that.

270
00:12:42,738 --> 00:12:44,265
What can I say?
You know, it's a gift.

271
00:12:44,426 --> 00:12:48,407
I only wish I could teach you,
but, you know, it's inborn.

272
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:51,703
By the way, thanks for inviting
me to the flea market.

273
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:54,164
- What?
- Yeah. Jerry, he told me all about it.

274
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,690
- Great.
- I didn't know.

275
00:12:57,161 --> 00:12:59,649
Oh, so that's why
you were acting so funny.

276
00:12:59,808 --> 00:13:01,684
Well, I didn't know
you wanted to go.

277
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:04,099
A flea market?
You went to a flea market?

278
00:13:04,258 --> 00:13:07,204
- Who's talking to you?
- We just didn't think of you.

279
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:09,820
- You said it, sister.
- Every time I leave my house now...

280
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:12,886
...I have to call everybody and ask
if they wanna do what I'm doing?

281
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,802
People forget. Look at Home Alone.
They forgot.

282
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,172
Great move telling him, by the way.
Real smart move.

283
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:21,212
I didn't know I wasn't supposed
to say anything.

284
00:13:21,405 --> 00:13:24,546
Judgment, Jerry, judgment.
You exercise no judgment!

285
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,308
You're right. My fault.

286
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:27,613
I'm sorry, Kramer.

287
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:29,453
I'm so sorry. Really.

288
00:13:29,614 --> 00:13:31,294
Yeah. I'm sorry.

289
00:13:31,455 --> 00:13:34,018
I'm sorry. I don't care for that "sorry."

290
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,786
What's wrong with that sorry?
That was a good sorry. Jerry...

291
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,853
...was that a good sorry?
- It was a so-so sorry.

292
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:43,494
Hey! Move this car!
I gotta get through!

293
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:45,910
You heard the man.

294
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:47,947
I guess you better be moving your car.

295
00:13:48,103 --> 00:13:50,242
Like you're not just gonna
back it in if I do that.

296
00:13:50,405 --> 00:13:52,739
Well, somebody better move
something soon!

297
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,811
I got a truck full of ice cream here!

298
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:02,909
They had to move the cars so the
truck could get through, right?

299
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:06,205
These guys don't trust each other,
so they got two nonpartisan drivers...

300
00:14:06,363 --> 00:14:07,540
...to move them.

301
00:14:12,423 --> 00:14:13,950
Wild pack of teenagers, huh?

302
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:15,213
Yeah.

303
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:19,170
Amazing how they pick you
out of everyone to terrorize.

304
00:14:19,328 --> 00:14:23,005
Yeah. I know. I said to myself,
"Why us?" You remember?

305
00:14:23,164 --> 00:14:25,575
Sounds like you did
some pretty nifty manoeuvring.

306
00:14:25,734 --> 00:14:29,291
You know, it's interesting, under that
pressure, what you're capable of.

307
00:14:29,455 --> 00:14:31,746
- Right.
- I learned a lot about myself.

308
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,090
- What did you do to my car?
- I couldn't help it!

309
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:37,233
Elaine moved the mirror!
I got discombobulated!

310
00:14:37,396 --> 00:14:39,043
Like you've ever been "bobulated."

311
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,955
I thought you said
you were a good driver.

312
00:14:41,117 --> 00:14:43,986
No, I never said I was a good driver,
I said, I was a good parker.

313
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,867
I think you said driver.

314
00:14:46,027 --> 00:14:48,634
Parker. I never said driver.
I said, parker. Great parker.

315
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:50,545
That's not the way it was.
Move it up.

316
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:53,074
- No, that's the right position.
- No, no. I was further in.

317
00:14:53,238 --> 00:14:54,580
No, you weren't. Stop there.

318
00:14:54,735 --> 00:14:55,999
- Do you mind?
- Do you?

319
00:14:56,154 --> 00:14:57,681
Somebody better move these cars.

320
00:14:57,995 --> 00:14:59,751
- You're making a commotion.
- Hey, Sid.

321
00:14:59,913 --> 00:15:01,975
- Who are you?
- Never mind who I am.

322
00:15:02,138 --> 00:15:03,316
I know who I am.

323
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:04,583
Do you know who you are?

324
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,690
Why is it every time
you park a car in this block...

325
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:09,654
...everything gets disrupted
and disjointed?

326
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,024
- Sid, it's completely his fault.
- Right.

327
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:13,792
Why don't you start
taking the bus.

328
00:15:13,953 --> 00:15:17,324
Let's go. I'm putting it in the garage.
The fight's starting in two minutes.

329
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:18,627
- Enough!
- No! Don't do it!

330
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,391
Are we gonna stay here all night?

331
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:22,809
Yes. I'm not giving him the
satisfaction. It's my space.

332
00:15:22,967 --> 00:15:24,768
Why don't you just flip a coin, already.

333
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,418
No, this is a matter of principle.

334
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:29,901
That would be saying anybody can
pull into any space any way they want.

335
00:15:30,064 --> 00:15:32,824
I'm making a stand here.
I'm saying no to headfirst parking!

336
00:15:32,979 --> 00:15:35,271
We put up with too
much crap in this city!

337
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,267
We're not putting up
with headfirst parking!

338
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:40,909
Maybe if you hadn't been pontificating
about what a great parker you were...

339
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:42,600
...you might have got the space.

340
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,212
So you're against me now?

341
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,977
He could have pulled up
to that car and backed in...

342
00:15:48,132 --> 00:15:49,702
...but he chose to go in headfirst.

343
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:52,924
No, he couldn't, because the other
car was already backing in.

344
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,993
- No, he wasn't.
- All that matters is who was there first.

345
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:58,832
You're not even old enough to drive,
you little puke.

346
00:15:58,988 --> 00:16:00,133
You just spit on me!

347
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:03,010
Don't you raise your voice to me.

348
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:04,696
You're not my father!

349
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:06,078
Hey, Matthew.

350
00:16:06,238 --> 00:16:07,339
Hi, Jerry.

351
00:16:07,503 --> 00:16:09,030
This guy's really a jerk.

352
00:16:09,191 --> 00:16:11,482
- How you doing?
- Okay.

353
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,480
I hear your father's closing his store.

354
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:15,245
What?

355
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:17,697
- No. Nothing.
- What's happened to Daddy?

356
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:20,119
- He's going out of business?
- No, no, no.

357
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:21,848
We're not going to have
any money?

358
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:24,065
- We're out of money?
- No, of course not.

359
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:25,373
Mommy!

360
00:16:25,533 --> 00:16:27,213
Jerry says Daddy's closing the store.

361
00:16:27,374 --> 00:16:29,207
He's going out of business.

362
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:30,972
We don't have any money?

363
00:16:31,133 --> 00:16:33,118
Jerry, what's the matter with you?

364
00:16:33,627 --> 00:16:34,892
I didn't...

365
00:16:35,046 --> 00:16:36,497
I don't know about
your friend Jerry.

366
00:16:36,657 --> 00:16:38,380
He says some stupid
things sometimes.

367
00:16:38,537 --> 00:16:39,802
Yeah.

368
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,552
- Congratulations.
- What for?

369
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:45,209
Well, you're pregnant.

370
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:47,470
- What?
- You're not pregnant?

371
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:49,046
No, I'm not pregnant.

372
00:16:49,815 --> 00:16:52,880
- Are you sure you're not pregnant?
- Yes, I'm sure!

373
00:16:53,535 --> 00:16:54,877
- That's weird.
- Come on, Matthew.

374
00:16:55,031 --> 00:16:56,635
- No!
- Come on, Matthew!

375
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:58,898
I thought she was pregnant.

376
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:01,053
Hey, do you think I'm a phoney?

377
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:02,855
- What?
- Mike thinks I'm a phoney.

378
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,225
- He thinks you're a phoney?
- But I can't say anything...

379
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:08,106
...because I'm not supposed to know.
- You have to say something.

380
00:17:08,266 --> 00:17:09,946
I can't. I told Kramer
I was vaulting it.

381
00:17:10,107 --> 00:17:12,016
- You gotta open the vault.
- Open my vault?!

382
00:17:12,178 --> 00:17:14,088
- Open your vault.
- Once I open the vault...

383
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:16,355
...it ceases to be a vault.
- You have no choice.

384
00:17:16,628 --> 00:17:18,232
The vault.

385
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,230
You know why you can't go
in front-first? I'll tell you why.

386
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:23,916
Because it signals a breakdown
in the social order.

387
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:27,441
Chaos! It reduces us to jungle law.

388
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:30,086
When can you park headfirst?

389
00:17:30,246 --> 00:17:31,424
Never.

390
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:33,498
- Why are you asking him?
- Who's talking to you?

391
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,689
He's right! Never!

392
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,570
What if you got 10 car lengths?

393
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:39,831
Should you pull all the
way to the front car?

394
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:41,364
If you got 10 car lengths...

395
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:43,095
When do you ever have
10 car lengths?

396
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,624
What about Sundays
and holidays?

397
00:17:44,784 --> 00:17:46,465
Please.

398
00:17:46,626 --> 00:17:48,152
What's going on here?

399
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:51,074
This guy tried to sneak
into my space.

400
00:17:51,229 --> 00:17:54,753
I really hate people who do that. I hope
you don't let him get away with it.

401
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:57,052
Thank you for your support.

402
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:59,396
Hey, that's a great hat.

403
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:01,156
Really? You like it?

404
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:03,191
I got it at a flea market today.

405
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:05,336
- Hey, George, nice hat.
- Yeah, thanks.

406
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:07,255
- Can I try it on?
- No! It wouldn't fit you.

407
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,249
- Sure, it would.
- No! Get out of here, Newman.

408
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:10,863
- Let me try it.
- No! Stop it!

409
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,855
- Let him try it on.
- I don't want him to!

410
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:14,774
What is wrong with you?

411
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:18,302
You want to see? There!
There it is! Run!

412
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,723
All right! You wanna try on the hat?!
Try on the hat!

413
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:23,140
Stop it, George! Stop it.
I was defending your parking.

414
00:18:23,298 --> 00:18:25,283
- Come on, George!
- Okay, just keep the hat!

415
00:18:25,446 --> 00:18:27,934
That's it. The fight's already started.
I'm going upstairs.

416
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:30,548
- Who's coming? Elaine?
- Depends on who's going. You going?

417
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:32,686
- I'm not going if he's going!
- Me either!

418
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:34,911
- Well, I'm going.
- lf he's going, I'm not going!

419
00:18:35,074 --> 00:18:36,601
- It's your house!
- I don't have to go.

420
00:18:36,762 --> 00:18:39,021
- I won't go if Jerry's not.
- Why won't you go if I go?

421
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,088
Why? I'll tell you why.

422
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,163
- No. Don't, Jerry.
- Like you didn't call me a phoney!

423
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,584
What?

424
00:18:45,738 --> 00:18:47,386
- Thanks! Real good!
- All right.

425
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:48,763
Jerry.

426
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,368
I think you completely
misunderstood what I said.

427
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:53,025
I meant it in a complimentary way.

428
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,357
You know, when people say, " He's
bad," it really means, " He's good."

429
00:18:56,518 --> 00:18:57,859
That sort of thing?

430
00:18:58,014 --> 00:19:00,850
- You know, slang.
- Use it in a sentence.

431
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,180
Man, that Michael Jordan
is so phoney.

432
00:19:04,496 --> 00:19:05,674
Why did you tell him?!

433
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:08,785
- He begged me!
- He begged you?!

434
00:19:08,946 --> 00:19:11,008
Come on, who wants
to watch the fight?

435
00:19:11,171 --> 00:19:13,931
Okay, whose cars are these?
Let's move them. Let's go.

436
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,810
Officer, can I explain
something to you?

437
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:19,140
Let's go, or I'm gonna write both
of you a ticket in about two minutes.

438
00:19:19,303 --> 00:19:20,984
He can't pull in headfirst!

439
00:19:21,145 --> 00:19:22,945
Officer, he backed up
from down the street!

440
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:24,934
He was double-parked!
He was sitting there!

441
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:29,765
All right, you move your car. It's his
space. You can't go in headfirst.

442
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:33,266
Wait a second.

443
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,374
Why can't he go in headfirst?

444
00:19:35,722 --> 00:19:37,554
He said the guy
was just sitting over there.

445
00:19:37,908 --> 00:19:40,090
What are you talking about?
This guy was here first.

446
00:19:40,248 --> 00:19:42,703
- But he didn't take it.
- Hey! It's his space!

447
00:19:42,856 --> 00:19:44,580
No, it's his space!

448
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:47,222
You're gonna have to go
to the bathroom!

449
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:49,368
- You'll have to go to work!
- I don't have a job!

450
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:51,484
Neither do I!

451
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,391
Seven.

452
00:19:58,814 --> 00:20:00,036
Eight.

453
00:20:00,694 --> 00:20:02,221
Nine.

454
00:20:02,612 --> 00:20:04,215
Ten.

455
00:20:07,484 --> 00:20:10,353
People will kill each other
for a parking space in New York.

456
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:13,918
Because they think, " If I don't get
this one, I may never get a space."

457
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:18,064
You know. " I'll circle for months until
somebody goes out to the Hamptons."

458
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:22,591
Everybody in New York City knows
there's gotta be way more cars...

459
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:23,929
...than parking spaces.

460
00:20:24,093 --> 00:20:27,006
You see cars driving in New York
all hours of the night.

461
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:31,144
It's like musical chairs, except
everybody sat down around 1964.

462
00:20:31,765 --> 00:20:35,366
The problem is, car manufacturers
are building hundreds of thousands...

463
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,594
...of new cars every year.

464
00:20:36,752 --> 00:20:39,086
They're not making any new spaces.

465
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:41,504
That's what they should work on.
Wouldn't that be great?

466
00:20:41,662 --> 00:20:44,303
You go to the auto show,
they got that big revolving turntable...

467
00:20:44,463 --> 00:20:46,110
...and there's nothing on it.

468
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:48,557
"New from Chrysler: a space."

469
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:34,475
