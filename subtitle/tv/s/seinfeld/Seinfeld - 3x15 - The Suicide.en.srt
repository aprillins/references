1
00:00:02,567 --> 00:00:04,225
Im going to get
a physical examination.

2
00:00:05,767 --> 00:00:09,215
That urine sample. Giving them that,
that's always a pleasure, isn't it?

3
00:00:09,383 --> 00:00:11,325
Then there's always
the amount question:

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,169
'I don't know what you need.
I gave you whatever I had there.

5
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:18,883
I got more. Whatever you need,
I can get it for you.

6
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:21,796
Just let me know what you need.
It's no problem, I mean....''

7
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:24,708
But any kind of physical test,
I don't know what it is...

8
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:27,588
...I always click into this thing
where I wanna do really well.

9
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:30,020
lf it's gonna be a physical test,
I wanna do well.

10
00:00:30,182 --> 00:00:32,069
Remember in school,
they'd do hearing tests?

11
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,881
And you'd really be listening,
you know...

12
00:00:35,206 --> 00:00:38,021
...trying to really--
Trying to do well, I wanna do well.

13
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:39,970
I wanted to do unbelievable
on that test.

14
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:42,751
I wanted them to come to me
after the test and go:

15
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:46,016
''We think you may have something
close to super hearing.

16
00:00:46,694 --> 00:00:50,817
What you heard was a cotton ball
touching a piece of felt.

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,400
We're sending the results
to Washington.

18
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,922
We'd like you
to meet the president.''

19
00:01:04,101 --> 00:01:05,311
Let me ask you a question.

20
00:01:05,893 --> 00:01:08,260
lf you named a kid Rasputin...

21
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:11,716
...do you think that would have
a negative effect on his life?

22
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:13,694
No.

23
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:16,320
What are you doing?
We're going out to dinner.

24
00:01:16,548 --> 00:01:19,712
Do you realize this is the last meal
Im gonna have for three days?

25
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:23,422
-Yeah.
-<i>George.

26
00:01:23,587 --> 00:01:25,148
Come on up.

27
00:01:25,603 --> 00:01:28,865
I never heard of this. You gotta fast
for three days to take an ulcer test.

28
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:30,686
-How will you do that?
-I don't know.

29
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:35,325
How could I possibly have ulcers?
Who could have given me ulcers?

30
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:38,559
I think Ill take out the garbage.

31
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:40,354
Have you ever fasted?

32
00:01:40,515 --> 00:01:43,100
Well, once I didn't have
dinner till, like, <i>9</i>:00.

33
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,879
Ill tell you, that was pretty rough.

34
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,908
Hey. Do me a favor, will you?

35
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:52,962
Throw out my garbage for me.

36
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,197
Yeah. Right.

37
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,752
Come on. Its just down the hall.

38
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:02,174
Give me 2 bucks.
Ill do it for 2 bucks.

39
00:02:04,194 --> 00:02:05,405
Ill give you 50 cents.

40
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,773
There's no way Id touch that bag
for less than $2.

41
00:02:07,938 --> 00:02:11,102
Come on, 50 cents. You can
get yourself a Drake's Coffee Cake.

42
00:02:11,937 --> 00:02:15,767
You're not getting no
Drake's Coffee Cake for 50 cents.

43
00:02:16,322 --> 00:02:19,289
Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going
to the Cayman Islands Friday.

44
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:22,458
I don't get you. Who goes
on vacation without a job?

45
00:02:22,625 --> 00:02:25,146
What do you need, a break
from getting up at 11?

46
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:29,181
Its a deal. I don't know
why you don't come with me.

47
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:31,036
I don't go for nonrefundable deals.

48
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:34,200
I can't commit to a woman,
Im not committing to an airline.

49
00:02:36,737 --> 00:02:38,166
-Hi.
-Hi.

50
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:39,611
How are you?

51
00:02:39,776 --> 00:02:41,467
Gina, do you know
Drake's Coffee Cake?

52
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:44,120
The plain cake with the sweet
brown crumbs on the top.

53
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,077
-Right. How much do they cost?
-The junior?

54
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,930
-No, no, no, the full-size.
-No, junior.

55
00:02:48,096 --> 00:02:51,544
-You didn't say ''junior.''
-I haven't had one since I was little.

56
00:02:51,712 --> 00:02:52,726
Really?

57
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:56,606
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I want you out of here.

58
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:02,711
-How you doing?
-Good enough.

59
00:03:06,015 --> 00:03:08,885
-Boy, she's sexy, isn't she?
-Yeah.

60
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:24,437
-Do you believe that guy?
-What guy?

61
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:26,810
-My neighbor.
-That creepy guy?

62
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:30,203
-Did he think I was flirting with her?
-He didn't seem too pleased.

63
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:34,420
Maybe Ill get a steak
with French-fried onion rings.

64
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:36,504
Hey, you know what?

65
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:38,740
I just remembered something.

66
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,587
I had a dream about that guy
last night. This is amazing.

67
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,467
-Amazing? You've seen him before.
-I haven't seen him in months.

68
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,156
What was the dream?

69
00:03:47,325 --> 00:03:51,122
He was doing standup comedy
in Kennebunkport, Maine...

70
00:03:51,294 --> 00:03:53,465
...in this really ominous nightclub.

71
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,572
The stage was on a cliff
and the audience...

72
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:57,629
...was throwing all the comics off.

73
00:03:57,885 --> 00:04:00,186
I think Ive played there.

74
00:04:01,149 --> 00:04:03,059
Ive had a lot of paranormal stuff
happen to me.

75
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:05,334
You're a little paranormal.

76
00:04:05,597 --> 00:04:07,801
Name one paranormal thing
that happened to you.

77
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:10,747
-I knew I was gonna be bald.
-Your father's bald.

78
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:13,397
Baldness is inherited
from the mother's side, Jerry.

79
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:15,801
But your mother's bald too.

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,573
George, you know,
my friend goes to a psychic.

81
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,780
-Really?
-We should go sometime.

82
00:04:21,948 --> 00:04:23,671
Id love to go.
Make an appointment.

83
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:26,706
Psychics, vacations.
How about getting a job?

84
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:32,213
-I just got fired.
-All right. Let's get out of here.

85
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,616
I wonder what Gandhi ate
before his fast.

86
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,819
I heard he used to polish off
a box of Triscuits.

87
00:04:36,988 --> 00:04:41,527
-Really?
-Oh, yeah. Gandhi loved Triscuits.

88
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:45,781
Who is it?

89
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,310
-Who is it?
-Its Gina!

90
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:50,744
-Who?
-Martin's girlfriend.

91
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:53,296
-Martin?
-Your next-door neighbor.

92
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,088
Oh, Martin!

93
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:58,674
Its Martin. I think he's dying.
He tried to kill himself with pills.

94
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:00,020
-What?
-Come on.

95
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:02,291
-Let me get my robe.
-We do not have time.

96
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,018
-Two seconds.
-There's no time.

97
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:06,259
-We don't have two seconds?
-All right, go ahead.

98
00:05:06,426 --> 00:05:08,215
-No, forget it.
-No, go ahead.

99
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:10,418
-No, Ill just wear the pajamas.
-Just get it!

100
00:05:10,587 --> 00:05:12,758
-Are you sure?
-Forget it. Come on.

101
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:14,994
No, Ill go get the robe.

102
00:05:18,681 --> 00:05:23,253
Its not too bad. Its not
like a Sunny von Bülow coma.

103
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,624
Doctor said he should
snap out of it any time.

104
00:05:28,826 --> 00:05:32,142
You know why he did this?
Because I told him it was over.

105
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:35,444
-I did not want to see him anymore.
-Really? Its over?

106
00:05:36,473 --> 00:05:38,677
I could not stand it another minute.

107
00:05:38,873 --> 00:05:41,328
Yesterday, he turned over
a hot dog stand...

108
00:05:41,497 --> 00:05:43,319
...because he thought
the man looked at me.

109
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:48,242
Then, after he saw you in the hall....
He was crazy with jealousy.

110
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:50,545
Oh, boy.

111
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:52,883
Did he say anything about me?

112
00:05:54,072 --> 00:05:56,145
He does not like you.

113
00:05:57,272 --> 00:06:00,916
And all indications are he does not
like Drake's Coffee Cake.

114
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:05,042
-He said that?
-He was screaming about it all night.

115
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:08,404
How it's too sweet and
it falls apart when you eat it.

116
00:06:09,815 --> 00:06:12,597
Im sorry if I caused any trouble.
I was just being friendly.

117
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:14,866
I wasn't.

118
00:06:15,415 --> 00:06:17,008
You weren't?

119
00:06:18,263 --> 00:06:21,711
No. I have thought
about you many times.

120
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:25,835
-Have you thought about me?
-Of course.

121
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,005
Tell me everything.

122
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:32,875
Are you sure
he can't hear anything?

123
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:36,304
Martin.

124
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,961
Martin!

125
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:44,269
I wish he was not in a coma.
I wish he was dead.

126
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,060
I would like to pull the plug out
from him!

127
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:49,905
I would wait on that one.

128
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:52,174
I know how you feel,
but juries today...

129
00:06:52,342 --> 00:06:54,830
...you never know how
they're gonna look at this.

130
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,957
I saw you looking at your watch.
You want to leave? Go ahead.

131
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:02,671
-I wanted to see what time it was.
-Are you afraid of him?

132
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:04,435
-No.
-Then kiss me.

133
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:06,190
-Here?
-Yes, right here.

134
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:08,948
Is this the proper venue?

135
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:11,468
-You don't want to?
-No, no, I want to.

136
00:07:11,637 --> 00:07:14,768
I very much want to. I desire to.
I pine to.

137
00:07:14,932 --> 00:07:16,558
Then kiss me right in front of him.

138
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:19,245
I can't! What if he wakes up?

139
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:22,130
A man is lying here unconscious
and you're afraid of him?

140
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,588
What kind of a man are you?

141
00:07:24,756 --> 00:07:27,342
Im a man who respects a good coma.

142
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:32,815
lf it was one of those
in-and-out comas, maybe.

143
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,947
But when a guy's got a coma
going like this...

144
00:07:36,116 --> 00:07:38,123
...you don't wanna mess with it.

145
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:43,945
-Hey.
-Hey.

146
00:07:44,147 --> 00:07:46,602
-Did you hear about Martin?
-Yeah, I heard.

147
00:07:46,771 --> 00:07:50,284
I can't believe he's in a coma.
He's got my vacuum cleaner.

148
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:56,334
I loaned it to him, he never
returned it. The carpets are filthy.

149
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:59,314
-What am I gonna do?
-Who told you about Martin?

150
00:07:59,475 --> 00:08:01,330
Newman.
He's good friends with him.

151
00:08:01,683 --> 00:08:04,072
Bigmouth Newman.
I should have guessed.

152
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:07,054
He's got all my attachments,
you know.

153
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:09,960
Let me ask you something.
How long do you have to wait...

154
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:13,546
...for a guy to come out of a coma
before you ask his ex-girlfriend out?

155
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,370
Oh, Gina?

156
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:19,081
Why wait?
Why not just call Dr. Kevorkian.

157
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,657
I don't get that
whole suicide machine.

158
00:08:23,826 --> 00:08:26,509
There's no tall buildings
where these people live?

159
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:30,448
They can't wrap their lips around
a revolver like a normal person?

160
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:32,971
What's going on
between you and Gina?

161
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:35,535
Well, I went with her
to the hospital last night.

162
00:08:35,825 --> 00:08:40,200
So we're in the room and she's trying
to get me to kiss her in front of him.

163
00:08:40,369 --> 00:08:42,573
That's the great thing
about Mediterranean women.

164
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:44,264
All right. So, what did you do?

165
00:08:45,872 --> 00:08:49,450
-Nothing.
-What kind of a man are you?

166
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,438
The guy is unconscious, in a coma...

167
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:53,902
...and you don't have the guts
to kiss his girlfriend?

168
00:08:54,641 --> 00:08:56,550
I didn't know what
the coma etiquette was.

169
00:08:56,721 --> 00:08:58,509
There is no coma etiquette.

170
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:02,250
See, that's the beauty of the coma.
It doesn't matter what you do.

171
00:09:03,632 --> 00:09:08,171
So you're saying his girl, his car,
his clothes, it's all up for grabs.

172
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,351
You can just loot the coma victim.

173
00:09:11,056 --> 00:09:13,706
I give them 2 4 hours to get out of it.

174
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:17,319
They can't get out of it
by 2 4 hours, it's a land rush.

175
00:09:19,216 --> 00:09:21,605
So if the coma victim wakes up
in a month...

176
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:23,914
...he's thrilled. He got out of the coma.

177
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:26,762
-He goes home, there's nothing left?
-Nothing left!

178
00:09:29,231 --> 00:09:33,421
That's why Im trying to get that
vacuum. Somebody's gonna grab it.

179
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:41,384
Martin's spirit came to you
as a warning.

180
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,989
Why would he come to George?

181
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:45,638
Because George has heightened
extrasensory perception.

182
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:47,529
Faithy, get your finger
out of your nose!

183
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:51,589
-I knew it. I always felt different.
-You are. Some coffee cake?

184
00:09:52,494 --> 00:09:54,698
-Drake's?
-Yes.

185
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,837
-Did you buy this for me?
-No, why?

186
00:09:57,838 --> 00:10:00,107
Because I love Drake's Coffee Cake.

187
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,084
-Maybe I did.
-Take it away.

188
00:10:03,246 --> 00:10:05,220
She hasn't eaten in two days.

189
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,586
-Who's Pauline?
-Pauline?

190
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:10,916
Wait a minute. Oh, my God.

191
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:14,119
My brother once impregnated
a woman named Pauline.

192
00:10:14,286 --> 00:10:16,325
-You think about her?
-When I hear her name.

193
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:19,081
Cut these with your left hand.

194
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:26,081
There was a woman. Audrey.

195
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:28,172
She had a very big nose.

196
00:10:28,717 --> 00:10:30,953
I see an Audrey,
but with a small nose.

197
00:10:31,116 --> 00:10:33,799
Yes, yes. She had a nose job.

198
00:10:34,028 --> 00:10:36,450
I loved her very deeply.

199
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,027
Will she ever speak to me again?

200
00:10:38,636 --> 00:10:40,327
Not in this life.

201
00:10:40,876 --> 00:10:43,942
-Should you be smoking?
-Does it bother you?

202
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,449
-You're pregnant.
-Elaine.

203
00:10:45,964 --> 00:10:48,201
I smoked when I had Faithy.

204
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:51,206
What? What?

205
00:10:51,372 --> 00:10:53,314
I don't know about this trip, George.

206
00:10:53,484 --> 00:10:55,174
You can see the Cayman Islands
in there?

207
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,223
Is something gonna happen
to me? What?

208
00:10:57,387 --> 00:10:59,721
Its really bad for the fetus,
you know that?

209
00:10:59,883 --> 00:11:01,988
She's a psychic.
She knows how the kid's gonna be.

210
00:11:02,155 --> 00:11:04,643
Should I not go on this trip?

211
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:06,400
George...

212
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:10,986
...I am going to tell you something
and I want you to really hear me.

213
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:14,693
Now, listen, I just don't know
how a person, with everything...

214
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:20,325
...we now know about prenatal care,
can put a cigarette in her mouth!

215
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,278
-What are you doing?
-Its disgusting.

216
00:11:22,443 --> 00:11:24,231
-I don't need this!
-Look, please!

217
00:11:24,394 --> 00:11:26,249
-I would like you both to leave.
-Oh, fine.

218
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:29,540
Well, I don't like to be around people
who are just so irresponsible.

219
00:11:29,706 --> 00:11:33,022
-Get the hell out.
-A plane crash?! A heart attack?!

220
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,500
Lupus? Is it lupus?

221
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:38,278
Do you want me to call the super?
He was an Israeli commando.

222
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,657
lf you don't say anything,
Ill assume it's a plane crash.

223
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:46,279
-Get out.
-Not a plane crash.

224
00:11:47,146 --> 00:11:49,185
Is it a plane crash?

225
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:51,688
Psychics should be licensed.

226
00:11:51,849 --> 00:11:54,981
And it wouldn't be hard. We could
just give them the regular DMV test...

227
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:58,276
...only with the silver dollars and
the pizza dough over the eyes.

228
00:11:58,472 --> 00:12:01,506
lf you can do the parallel park
like that, you're a psychic.

229
00:12:01,672 --> 00:12:04,039
We can test these people,
no question about it.

230
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,015
Like Kreskin. Instead
of just hiding his check...

231
00:12:07,176 --> 00:12:10,111
...why don't we try
stopping his check.

232
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,452
Let's see how he handles that.

233
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:15,806
I do not like your toothbrush.

234
00:12:16,488 --> 00:12:18,081
There are no bristles.

235
00:12:18,952 --> 00:12:20,959
You can say what you want
about me...

236
00:12:21,192 --> 00:12:23,363
...but Ill be damned
if Im gonna stand here...

237
00:12:23,528 --> 00:12:25,764
...while you insult my toothbrush.

238
00:12:26,952 --> 00:12:30,432
It is too small for someone
with such a big mouth.

239
00:12:33,031 --> 00:12:34,853
Let me ask you...

240
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:38,978
...what will you do if Martin
wakes up? Run away like a mouse?

241
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,550
No, more like the Three Stooges
at the end of every movie.

242
00:12:44,743 --> 00:12:46,401
Who are these stooges
you speak of?

243
00:12:47,303 --> 00:12:48,896
They're a comedy team.

244
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:52,068
Tell me about them. Everything.

245
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:56,997
Well, they're three funny-looking guys
and they'd hit each other a lot.

246
00:12:57,446 --> 00:13:01,221
-You will show me the stooges?
-I will show you the stooges.

247
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:04,896
-When?
-Well...

248
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,741
...I don't really know where
the stooges are right now...

249
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,692
...but if I locate them,
you'll be the first to know.

250
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,651
Come. You walk me to a cab.

251
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:17,086
Well, l....

252
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:19,520
I don't want you to get upset
or anything...

253
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:23,231
...but with Martin and all, maybe it's
not a good idea to be seen together...

254
00:13:23,397 --> 00:13:25,601
...in the building,
because he had a lot of friends.

255
00:13:25,861 --> 00:13:28,032
You are still afraid.
You are not a man.

256
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:31,905
Well, then what are all those ties and
sports jackets doing in my closet?

257
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:34,465
Are you going to walk me
to a cab or not?

258
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,762
Yeah, all right, all right.

259
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:45,914
-Why don't you just eat fruit.
-Fruit makes me incontinent.

260
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:47,546
I don't want you eating over here.

261
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,623
Hello, Gina. Hello, Jerry.

262
00:13:51,236 --> 00:13:53,146
Hello, Newman.

263
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,742
Do you think Newman
would tell Martin if he wakes up?

264
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:07,234
What kind of sicko would do that?
He could kill me.

265
00:14:07,427 --> 00:14:09,085
People smoke, Elaine.

266
00:14:09,507 --> 00:14:11,230
My mother smoked.

267
00:14:11,971 --> 00:14:13,793
It didn't hurt me.

268
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:18,040
Did you guys see that wall move?

269
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,370
Boy, it's a good thing we came.

270
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:23,870
Could there be a native problem
in the Caymans?

271
00:14:24,034 --> 00:14:25,343
Maybe there's native unrest.

272
00:14:25,506 --> 00:14:28,889
Hi. I haven't eaten in three days.

273
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,730
I was wondering how much longer
it would be till I get my X-ray.

274
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,300
We'll call you.

275
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:38,270
George, I want you to promise me
something. lf Im ever in a coma...

276
00:14:38,433 --> 00:14:42,808
...in the first 2 4 hours, get everything
out of my place and put it in storage.

277
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:46,399
-How come?
-Looters.

278
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:50,332
How do we know the dog food's
any good?

279
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:54,942
Who tastes it?

280
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:57,308
She is really hungry.

281
00:14:57,825 --> 00:15:00,192
-Hey.
-Kramer.

282
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:03,416
Well, Newman's upstairs
visiting Martin.

283
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:07,355
Would you buy
my Cayman Island ticket?

284
00:15:08,256 --> 00:15:09,718
-You're not going?
-No.

285
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:11,449
-Why not?
-The psychic said...

286
00:15:11,648 --> 00:15:13,110
...something terrible will happen.

287
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:16,375
I dig.

288
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:21,435
I want my vacuum cleaner!

289
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:24,121
Martin, I know you can hear me.

290
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:27,866
Look, my mother's coming to visit me.
She sees that rug, she's gonna kill me.

291
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:31,381
He can't hear you, you idiot.
Why don't you just buy another one.

292
00:15:32,287 --> 00:15:35,702
Why would I buy another one when
I spent 1 00 bucks on this one?

293
00:15:36,064 --> 00:15:37,973
I have a carpet sweeper
you can use.

294
00:15:38,144 --> 00:15:41,340
I don't want a carpet sweeper.
They don't do anything.

295
00:15:41,503 --> 00:15:42,910
It gets my rug clean.

296
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:45,591
The carpet sweeper
is the biggest scam...

297
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,305
...perpetrated on the American
public since One Hour Martinizing.

298
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,129
You should take a look
at my rug, then.

299
00:15:51,294 --> 00:15:53,498
I wouldn't set foot in your house.

300
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:56,986
-Hello.
-Hey.

301
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:58,873
Hello, Jerry.

302
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,314
-How's he doing?
-Well, he looks happy to me.

303
00:16:04,478 --> 00:16:07,860
I hope he stays this happy
when he wakes up.

304
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:10,648
-Why wouldn't he?
-No reason.

305
00:16:11,102 --> 00:16:13,589
He'll have a lot of catching up
to do, I guess.

306
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:16,054
Ill bring him up to date.

307
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:18,899
-How up to date?
-All the way up.

308
00:16:20,701 --> 00:16:22,708
Nothing could change your mind?

309
00:16:23,037 --> 00:16:27,859
Well, it would take a lot, because
a friend is something you earn.

310
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:32,377
Jerry has a friend who has free tickets
to the Cayman Islands this weekend.

311
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,710
He's not going.

312
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:38,172
I don't care much for the beach.
I freckle.

313
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:45,787
-Is that a...?
-Drake's Coffee Cake.

314
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:50,520
Where did you get that?

315
00:16:51,324 --> 00:16:54,804
From my house.
I got a whole box of them.

316
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,166
Boy. That's the full-size.

317
00:16:59,036 --> 00:17:00,946
That's your big boy.

318
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:04,374
Can I have a bite?

319
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:06,676
I don't like to give out bites.

320
00:17:06,908 --> 00:17:08,817
I got another one...

321
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:11,671
...but Im saving it for later.

322
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,583
Just one bite?

323
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:18,260
I don't think so.
You know, they're so fragile.

324
00:17:18,427 --> 00:17:21,045
All right! All right.

325
00:17:21,435 --> 00:17:22,645
I won't say anything.

326
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:24,785
-You swear?
-I swear.

327
00:17:24,955 --> 00:17:27,890
-On your mother's life?
-On my mother's life.

328
00:17:39,674 --> 00:17:41,648
But here it was...

329
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,279
...mountains of duck.

330
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:50,958
And not fatty duck either,
but juicy, tender breasts of duck.

331
00:17:51,578 --> 00:17:52,985
-Beautifully sliced....
-Faithy!

332
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:54,575
Sweetheart, no, don't run!

333
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:56,633
You could take
as much as you want....

334
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:00,502
Sweetheart! Sweetheart! Faithy!

335
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:09,591
Hi. Hi! What are you doing here?
How did I know you were here?

336
00:18:09,753 --> 00:18:12,338
Something drew me here.
This is phenomenal.

337
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:13,813
The nurse said she'd be back.

338
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:15,700
Supposed to take me
to the delivery room.

339
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:18,101
Oh, that's great. That's great.

340
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,981
I have to apologize for my friend
the other day--

341
00:18:21,144 --> 00:18:23,184
Friend? I don't even
know that woman.

342
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,589
I met her on the way over.
I couldn't get rid of her.

343
00:18:25,752 --> 00:18:27,988
I tell you, my psychic instincts
were a little off--

344
00:18:29,016 --> 00:18:31,984
-Where's the nurse?
-Im sure she'll be right back.

345
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,902
Sweetheart, why don't you
run and get a nurse for Mommy.

346
00:18:35,064 --> 00:18:38,446
I was just curious. The other day
you said something about my trip.

347
00:18:38,872 --> 00:18:40,628
-Don't take that trip.
-Yeah! Why? Why?

348
00:18:41,336 --> 00:18:44,751
-Because.... Because....
-All right, Rula. Its time to go.

349
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:47,220
Yeah, because...? Because...?

350
00:18:47,831 --> 00:18:52,141
Assassins! How dare they keep
a person waiting like this!

351
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:55,188
Drake's Coffee Cake?

352
00:18:56,054 --> 00:18:58,509
-Give me that!
-Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell!

353
00:18:58,678 --> 00:19:01,526
Elaine, no! No!

354
00:19:05,014 --> 00:19:08,363
Are there terrorists on the plane?
A hotel fire, is that it?

355
00:19:08,534 --> 00:19:12,331
Typhus? Malaria? Yellow fever?
Lupus? Is it lupus?

356
00:19:12,502 --> 00:19:15,153
They did it right in this bed, Martin.
Right in front of you.

357
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:17,871
-I want my vacuum cleaner!
-I can explain!

358
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:19,925
It was disgusting!

359
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:27,793
What are you doing?
We're going to dinner in 1 0 minutes.

360
00:19:28,726 --> 00:19:31,278
I never assisted in a birth before.

361
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:33,294
Its really quite disgusting.

362
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:36,202
-What did she name the kid?
-You wouldn't believe it.

363
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:38,576
Rasputin.

364
00:19:40,085 --> 00:19:42,321
-Hey!
-Hey!

365
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:45,746
-When did you get back?
-A couple hours ago.

366
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:48,397
-So how was it?
-George...

367
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:53,260
...I would like to thank you
for the greatest four days of my life.

368
00:19:54,356 --> 00:19:57,738
They were shooting the
<i>Sports Illustrated</i> swimsuit issue...

369
00:19:57,908 --> 00:20:01,290
...right in the hotel pool.
Not only that...

370
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,143
...the hotel opened up an area
on the beach for nude bathing...

371
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,380
...and all of the models
went down there.

372
00:20:07,091 --> 00:20:10,833
I am on the next blanket
from Elle Macpherson.

373
00:20:11,891 --> 00:20:13,451
We played backgammon nude.

374
00:20:14,452 --> 00:20:17,354
-Oh, she's a sweet kid.
-Nude backgammon...

375
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:19,890
...with swimsuit models!

376
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:23,696
Oh, you know what? The second day
I was there, I stepped on a jellyfish.

377
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:28,944
It stung my foot. That's probably what
Rula was trying to warn you about.

378
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:31,212
-You gotta watch for the jellyfish.
-Yeah.

379
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:33,517
What's this?

380
00:20:33,683 --> 00:20:36,978
Its an invitation to a housewarming
for Martin and Gina.

381
00:20:37,235 --> 00:20:40,137
-They moved in together?
-Yeah, some place in the Village.

382
00:20:43,507 --> 00:20:45,295
-Yeah.
-<i>It's Elaine.

383
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,433
All right, we're coming down.

384
00:20:47,602 --> 00:20:49,675
-Where you going?
-We're taking Elaine to dinner.

385
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:52,559
She's gotta start the fast again.
You wanna go?

386
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:55,752
Id like to, but a bunch of us
from the islands are getting together.

387
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:59,240
-Elle Macpherson gonna be there?
-I gotta call her back.

388
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:04,747
The thing I don't understand
about the suicide person...

389
00:21:04,978 --> 00:21:07,792
...is the people that try
and commit suicide...

390
00:21:07,953 --> 00:21:12,558
...for some reason, they don't die,
and then that's it. They stop trying.

391
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:14,471
Why?

392
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,902
Why don't they just keep trying?
What has changed? Is their life better?

393
00:21:18,353 --> 00:21:21,255
No. In fact, it's worse,
because now they've found out...

394
00:21:21,424 --> 00:21:24,174
...here's one more thing you stink at.

395
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:27,662
That's why these people don't
succeed at life to begin with.

396
00:21:27,825 --> 00:21:31,719
Because they give up too easy.
I say pills don't work, try a rope.

397
00:21:33,008 --> 00:21:37,231
Car won't start in the garage?
Get a tune-up. You know what I mean?

398
00:21:37,392 --> 00:21:38,919
There's nothing more rewarding...

399
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:41,870
...than reaching a goal
you've set for yourself.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
