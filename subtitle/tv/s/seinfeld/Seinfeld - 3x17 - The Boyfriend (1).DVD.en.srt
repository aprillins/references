1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:05,894
At the health club,
people are working out...

2
00:00:06,072 --> 00:00:08,040
...and they're training,
getting in shape...

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:12,235
...but strangely, nobody's really
getting in shape for anything.

4
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,245
The only reason that you're
getting in shape...

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:18,043
...is that so you can get through
the workout.

6
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,513
So we're working out...

7
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:26,182
...so that we'll be in shape
for when we have to do our exercise.

8
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,251
This is the whole thing.

9
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:31,158
The other thing I don't get
is why we're so careful...

10
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:35,461
...about locking up our dirty towels
and smelly jockstraps.

11
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:42,304
What exactly is the black market
on these disgusting gym clothes?

12
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,909
I'll give my car to any guy
in front of a restaurant...

13
00:00:45,078 --> 00:00:47,444
...because he's got a short
red jacket.

14
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,081
"He must be the valet guy."

15
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,649
But my stinking,
putrefied gym clothes...

16
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,649
...I got one of these locks...

17
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,550
...you could put a bullet through it
and it won't open.

18
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,247
That stuff is safe.

19
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,721
Wide open!
I was wide-open underneath.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,925
I had three inches on that guy.

21
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,729
See, you two were hogging the ball.

22
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,099
Me? It wasn't me.
I never even saw the ball.

23
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:14,604
All you do is dribble.

24
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:18,232
I have to dribble. If I give it to you,
you just shoot. You're a chucker.

25
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,878
-Oh, I'm a chucker.
-That's right.

26
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,843
Every time you get the ball,
you shoot.

27
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,277
I can't believe you
called me a chucker.

28
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,975
No way I'm a chucker! I do not chuck.
Never chuck!

29
00:01:26,152 --> 00:01:29,019
Never have chucked!
Never will chuck! No chuck!

30
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,481
You chuck.

31
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,125
-Kramer, am I a chucker?
-Oh, you're a chucker.

32
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,431
My God, I'm a chucker.

33
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:43,262
-All these years, you never told me?
-It's not an easy thing to bring up.

34
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:48,171
Hey, you know, this is the first time
we ever saw each other naked?

35
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,942
Believe me, I didn't see anything.

36
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,910
Oh, you didn't sneak a peek?

37
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,307
-No. Did you?
-Yeah, I snuck a peek.

38
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,783
-Why?
-Why not?

39
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,319
What about you, George?

40
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,556
Yeah, l...

41
00:02:06,726 --> 00:02:08,318
...snuck a peek.

42
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:12,022
But it was so fast, I didn't see
anything. It was just a blur.

43
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,893
I made a conscious effort not to look.

44
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,399
There's certain information
I just don't wanna have.

45
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,494
Okay....

46
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:20,767
I gotta go meet Newman.

47
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:24,138
-I'll see you later. Have a good one.
-All right.

48
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,240
Yeah.

49
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,180
Look at this guy.

50
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:33,478
Does he have to stretch in here?

51
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,818
-You know who that is?
-Who?

52
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,581
That's Keith Hernandez.

53
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,993
Keith Hernandez,
the baseball player?

54
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,327
Yeah, that's him.

55
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,862
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

56
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,899
Wow! Keith Hernandez!

57
00:02:49,068 --> 00:02:50,865
-He's such a great player.
-Yeah.

58
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,335
He's a real smart guy too.
He's a Civil War buff.

59
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,236
Wow, I'd love to be a Civil War buff.

60
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,013
What do you have to do
to become a buff?

61
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,975
So Biff wants to be a buff?

62
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,077
Well, sleeping less than 18 hours
a day would be a start.

63
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,681
I only got two weeks left
of unemployment.

64
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,851
I gotta prove I've been looking
for a job to get an extension.

65
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,288
Hey, should we say something
to him?

66
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,228
Oh, I'm sure he loves to hear
from fans in the locker room.

67
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,699
Well, he could say hello to me.
I wouldn't mind.

68
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,369
He's Keith Hernandez.

69
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,700
You're Jerry Seinfeld.

70
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,380
-So?
-What, you're comparing yourself...

71
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,914
...to Keith Hernandez?

72
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,848
The guy's a baseball player,
Jerry, baseball!

73
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,887
I know what he is. I recognized him.
You didn't even notice him.

74
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,049
What, you're making some wisecracks
in a nightclub?

75
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:53,494
The guy was in game six, two runs
down, two outs, facing elimination!

76
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,894
Excuse me.

77
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,229
I don't want to disturb you.
I'm Keith Hernandez.

78
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,668
And I just want to tell you what
a big fan I am. I love your comedy.

79
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,309
-Really?
-I've always wanted to do what you do.

80
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,575
Do what I do?! You're one
of my favorite ballplayers of all time!

81
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,082
Mine too.

82
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,182
-I love that bit about Jimmy Olsen.
-Really?

83
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,386
Thank you.

84
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,621
You know, Keith,
what I've always wondered is...

85
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:26,492
...with all these ball clubs
flying around all season...

86
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:29,328
...wouldn't you think
there'd be a plane crash?

87
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,436
Are you performing in New York now?

88
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,804
At this club on the East Side.
You should come in.

89
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:42,243
But think about it:
26 teams, 162 games a season.

90
00:04:42,415 --> 00:04:45,942
You'd think eventually, an entire team
would just get wiped out.

91
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,686
I live on the East Side.

92
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,119
I'll give you my number...

93
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,283
...and just tell me whenever
you want to go.

94
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,224
-Or maybe just get together for coffee.
-Oh, that'd be great.

95
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:00,689
Well, it's only a matter of time.

96
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,565
Who's this chucker?

97
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,570
It's been three days,
and he hasn't called.

98
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,311
Well, maybe you should call him.

99
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,140
I can't. I can't.

100
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,978
-Why not?
-I just feel like he should call me.

101
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,449
What's the difference?

102
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,487
You don't understand, Elaine.
I don't want to be overanxious.

103
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,490
If he wants to see me,
he has my number. He should call.

104
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:33,157
God, look at this ashtray.
I hate cigarettes.

105
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,365
I can't stand these guys.

106
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,231
You give your number to them,
and then they don't call.

107
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,162
Why do they do that?

108
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,536
I'm sorry, honey.

109
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:48,505
I mean, I really thought he liked me.
We were getting along.

110
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,774
He came over to me.
I didn't go over to him.

111
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,783
-I know.
-Why did he come over to me?

112
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:57,116
I mean, here I meet this great guy,
this ballplayer...

113
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,258
-...best guy I ever met.
-Yeah. I know.

114
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:03,555
Well, that's it. I'm never giving
my number out to another guy again.

115
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,894
I've given my number out to guys,
and it takes them a month to call.

116
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,693
Good. Good.
Well, if he's calling in a month...

117
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,805
...he's got a prayer.

118
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,877
You know, maybe he's been busy.
Maybe he's been out of town.

119
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,309
Oh, what, they don't have phones
out of town?

120
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,373
I love how people say
they're too busy. "Too busy."

121
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,609
Pick up a phone!

122
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:29,550
Takes two minutes.
How can you be too busy?

123
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:34,322
-Why don't you just go and call him?
-I can't call here. It's a coffee shop.

124
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:38,157
-I mean, what am I gonna say to him?
-Just ask if he wants to get together.

125
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,222
For what, dinner?

126
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:42,891
Dinner's good.

127
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:47,896
Don't you think that's coming on a little
too strong? Isn't that, like, a turnoff?

128
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,741
Jerry, he's a guy.

129
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,274
I know, but this is all very confusing.

130
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:59,082
When you're in your 30s,
it's very hard to make a new friend.

131
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,415
Whatever the group is you've got now,
that's who you're going with.

132
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,216
You're not interviewing,
not looking at any new people.

133
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,588
You're not interested in seeing
any applications.

134
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,355
They don't know the places.
They don't know the foods.

135
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:13,123
They don't know the activities.

136
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,700
If I meet a guy at a club or a gym:
"Hey, look, I'm sure you're very nice.

137
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:20,168
You seem to have a lot of potential.
We're just not hiring right now."

138
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:21,533
When you're a kid...

139
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:24,972
...you can be friends with anybody.
Remember when you're a little kid...

140
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:28,341
...what are the qualifications? "lf
someone's in front of my house...

141
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:31,005
...that's my friend.
They're my friend. That's it.

142
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:33,948
Are you a grownup?
No? Great. Come on in!

143
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,612
Let's jump up and down on my bed!"
And if you have anything in common:

144
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,351
"You like cherry soda? I like
cherry soda! We'll be best friends!"

145
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,328
You only have two more weeks
before your benefits run out.

146
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,533
Yes, and I was hoping, perhaps,
to get...

147
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:56,174
...a 13-week extension,
if that's possible.

148
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,669
So where have you been looking
for work?

149
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,676
You know what I've discovered,
Mrs. Sokol?

150
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,015
It's not so much the looking...

151
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,410
...as the listening.

152
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:07,519
I listen for work.
As I'm looking...

153
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:10,656
...and listening-- I'm also looking.
You cannot discount looking.

154
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,814
It's a combination.
It's looking. And listening.

155
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,359
Listening. And looking.
But you must look.

156
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,827
Can you be specific
about any of these companies?

157
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,192
Specific. Let's see....

158
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,358
I've walked in and out
of so many buildings.

159
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:25,003
They all blend in together.

160
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,763
Just give me one name.

161
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,832
One name. Absolutely.

162
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,470
Let's see, there's....

163
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,872
Vandalay lndustries.

164
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,536
I just saw them. I got very close there.
Very close.

165
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:37,706
What type of company is that?

166
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,276
Latex. Latex manufacturing,
Mrs. Sokol.

167
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,547
-And you interviewed there?
-Yes, for a sales position.

168
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,157
Latex salesman.

169
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:50,227
The selling of latex
and latex-related products.

170
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,523
They just wouldn't give me a chance.
Damn it!

171
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:57,066
Now I'm going to need an address
and a phone number for this...

172
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,464
...Vandalay company.

173
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:00,428
You like gum?

174
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,905
Because I have a friend in the gum
business. I got a gum guy!

175
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:07,170
I make one phone call, have boxes
of gum delivered right to your door.

176
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,007
The address?

177
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,179
The address is....

178
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,113
Jose Jimenez.
Do you recognize that?

179
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:21,182
-No.
-Jose Jimenez.

180
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,761
Very funny.
Really, he's very funny.

181
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,626
The address.

182
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,168
Vandalay is...

183
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:35,034
...129 West 81st Street.
It's a very small industry, Vandalay.

184
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,038
It's why I wanted
to work for them.

185
00:09:37,209 --> 00:09:39,109
A phone number.

186
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,008
That's...KL5...

187
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,709
...8383. Are you planning on
calling them soon?

188
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:47,114
Because they have
very strange hours.

189
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,583
As soon as I'm done with you.

190
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,419
Sure. Well....

191
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,855
You know, I'll check in with you
next week.

192
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,689
I gotta run now because
I got a full plate this afternoon.

193
00:09:57,863 --> 00:10:01,799
-Okay.
-All right. Really good to....

194
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:08,996
He'll call you back!

195
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,574
It's a par five.

196
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,438
So, you know, I step up to the tee...

197
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,070
...and I hit a beautiful drive
right down the middle of the fairway.

198
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,716
-I mean, you know my hook, right?
-Elaine?

199
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,710
How about this shirt?
Is this okay?

200
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,960
Jerry, he's a guy.

201
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:33,591
Well, it's a dogleg left,
so I play the hook.

202
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,098
Wait, hold on.
There's another call.

203
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,897
-Jerry! Jerry!
-George?

204
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,539
-Kramer, put Jerry on!
-I'm in the middle of something.

205
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:44,073
-Call back.
-Kramer, no--!

206
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,836
So the ball takes off,
and I'm waiting for it to turn.

207
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:55,750
Would you--!

208
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,884
All right. Well, I'll talk to Jerry.
Yeah.

209
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,685
Hey, that was Michael and Carol.

210
00:11:03,863 --> 00:11:05,831
She's wondering when
we'll go see the baby.

211
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:09,092
-See the baby. Again with the baby.
-Who are they?

212
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,498
A guy who used to live in the building
keeps calling us to see the baby.

213
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,903
"You gotta see the baby.
When are you gonna see the baby?"

214
00:11:16,075 --> 00:11:17,633
Can't they just send us a tape?

215
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,472
Maybe if you wait a few months,
it won't be a baby anymore.

216
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,444
-Then you won't have to see it.
-Because he'll be all grown-up.

217
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:24,947
Yeah....

218
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,718
Hey, Kramer, what do you think
of this shirt?

219
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,721
It's too busy.

220
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:38,227
You're trying too hard
to make an impression on him.

221
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:40,695
-You're not being yourself.
-What guy?

222
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,393
I know he's just a guy,
but I really like him.

223
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,072
Who are you talking about?

224
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,805
Keith...Hernandez.

225
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,909
Keith Hernandez?

226
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,808
Keith Hernandez!

227
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,614
Do me a favor, would you?
Would you change lanes?

228
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:00,911
You gotta get out of this lane.
This lane stinks.

229
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:03,885
They're all double-parked.
Get out, I'm begging you.

230
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,284
Please. Please!

231
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:11,961
You know what?

232
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:13,826
Bad mistake. My mistake.

233
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,263
Go back. Your lane was better.
Forget this lane.

234
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,427
This lane stinks. Go back to your lane.
Go ahead. Bad mistake.

235
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:23,434
Go! Go! Go! Make this light!
Make this light! Oh, man!

236
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,538
That's it! Get out!

237
00:12:25,711 --> 00:12:27,838
-What do you mean, get out?
-Get out of the cab!

238
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,742
What? I'm not getting out of this cab.

239
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,907
No! No! You cannot throw me out!

240
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,417
No! Get....

241
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,351
Hello, Newman.

242
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:38,785
I hate Keith Hernandez.

243
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,791
-Hate him!
-I despise him.

244
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,088
-Why?
-Why? I'll tell you why.

245
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,730
-Let me tell her.
-No, you can't--

246
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,627
-You always tell.
-All right, tell it.

247
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,859
-Just tell it.
-All right.

248
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:54,597
June 14th, 1987, Mets-Phillies.

249
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,039
We're enjoying a beautiful afternoon
in the right-field stands...

250
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,474
...when a crucial Hernandez error
opens the door...

251
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,740
...to a five-run Phillies ninth.
Cost the Mets the game!

252
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:06,817
Our day was ruined.

253
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,179
There was a lot of people waiting
by the players' parking lot.

254
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,846
Now we're coming down the ramp.

255
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,821
Newman was in front of me.

256
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,018
Hernandez was coming toward us.

257
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:21,394
As he passes us, Newman turns
and says, "Nice game, pretty boy."

258
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:26,268
Hernandez continued past us
up the ramp.

259
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,532
Then, a second later,
something happened...

260
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:33,610
...that changed us in a very deep
and profound way...

261
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,542
...from that day forward.

262
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,908
-What was it?
-He spit on us!

263
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:42,820
And I screamed out, "I'm hit!"

264
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,851
Then I turned, and the spit ricocheted
off him, and it hit me.

265
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,492
What a story.

266
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,396
Unfortunately, the immutable laws
of physics contradict...

267
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,935
...the whole premise of your account.

268
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:01,732
Allow me to reconstruct this,
if I may, for Ms. Benes...

269
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,501
...as I've heard this story
a number of times.

270
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,646
Newman, Kramer,
if you'll indulge me.

271
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,214
According to your story...

272
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,374
...Hernandez passes you
and starts walking up the ramp.

273
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,884
Then you say you were struck...

274
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,384
...on the right temple.

275
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,988
The spit then proceeds to ricochet...

276
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:26,222
...off the temple, striking Newman
between the third and the fourth rib.

277
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:30,697
The spit then came off the rib...

278
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,203
...made a right turn,
hitting Newman in the right wrist...

279
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,208
...causing him to drop
his baseball cap.

280
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,409
The spit then splashed off the wrist,
pauses...

281
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,607
...in midair, mind you...

282
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:51,787
...makes a left turn and lands
on Newman's left thigh.

283
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,922
That is one magic loogie.

284
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:07,105
Well, that's the way it happened.

285
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,205
What happened to your head
when you got hit?

286
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,173
Well, my head...

287
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,175
...went back, to the left.

288
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,940
-Say that again.
-Back and to the left.

289
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:19,775
Back and to the left.

290
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,788
Back and to the left.

291
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,788
So, what are you saying?

292
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,687
I'm saying...

293
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,455
...that the spit could not have
come from behind.

294
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:34,964
That there had to have been
a second spitter.

295
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,270
Behind the bushes,
on the gravelly road.

296
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:48,377
If the spitter was behind you,
as you claim...

297
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:52,142
...that would've caused your head
to pitch forward.

298
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:57,144
So the spit could've only come
from the front and to the right.

299
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,349
But that's not what they
would have you believe.

300
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,150
I'm leaving.

301
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:04,890
Jerry's a nut.

302
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,498
Wait, wait, wait.

303
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:11,195
The sad thing is,
we may never know the real truth.

304
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,842
Did anybody call
asking for Vandalay lndustries?

305
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,880
-No, what happened to you?
-All right, listen closely:

306
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,381
I was at the unemployment office.

307
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,885
I told them I was very close to getting
a job with Vandalay lndustries...

308
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,922
...and I gave them your phone number.
So when the phone rings...

309
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:35,560
...you have to answer,
"Vandalay lndustries."

310
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,026
-I'm Vandalay lndustries?
-Right.

311
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:40,392
-What is that?
-You're in latex.

312
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:42,193
-Latex?
-Right.

313
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,166
-What do I do with latex?
-I don't know! You manufacture it!

314
00:16:45,437 --> 00:16:49,396
-Right here in this little apartment?
-And what do I say about you?

315
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:52,008
You're considering hiring me
for your latex salesman.

316
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,139
-I'll hire you as my latex salesman?
-Right.

317
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:57,908
I don't think so.

318
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,314
Why would I do that?

319
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:04,012
Because I asked you to.

320
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,453
If you think I'm looking for someone
to just sit...

321
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,594
...pushing papers around,
you can forget it.

322
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:12,731
I've got enough headaches
just trying to manufacture the stuff.

323
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,429
-Yeah?
-It's Keith.

324
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,002
All right, we're coming down.

325
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,502
Keith Hernandez?

326
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:23,163
-Yeah. Come on, Elaine, let's go.
-Where are you going?

327
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:24,934
They're giving me a ride downtown.

328
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,943
You know, there had to have been
a second spitter. Who was it?

329
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,341
Who had the motive?

330
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,712
That's what I've been trying
to figure out the past five years.

331
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,876
What the hell are you two
talking about?

332
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,147
-That was really fun. Thanks.
-Yeah, it really was.

333
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,855
Should I shake his hand?

334
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,428
Well....

335
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,359
You want to catch a movie
this weekend?

336
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,591
Have you seen JFK?

337
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,962
No, I haven't.

338
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:54,806
This weekend. Wow!

339
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,666
Sure. That would be great.

340
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,007
Damn. I was too overanxious.
He must have noticed that.

341
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:04,338
I mean, if you want to.

342
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,451
-Well, how about this Friday?
-Yeah, Friday's okay.

343
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,218
Go ahead, shake his hand.
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.

344
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,517
I've been on The Tonight Show.

345
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,819
Well, good night.

346
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,360
Good night.

347
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,632
Oh, Jer, by the way...

348
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,630
...the woman we gave
a ride to earlier....

349
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:24,063
-Elaine.
-Yeah.

350
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,965
-What's her story?
-I don't know. We used to go out.

351
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,336
Would you mind if I gave her a call?

352
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,977
-For a date?
-Yeah.

353
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:34,806
Oh, no....

354
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,641
Go ahead.

355
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,373
You got a pen?

356
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,949
You sure you don't mind?

357
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:52,395
So then we went to dinner.

358
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,361
-Who paid?
-We split it.

359
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,057
Split it. Pretty good.

360
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,634
-Did you talk about game six?
-No. I gotta wait until it's the right time.

361
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,639
-Yeah?
-It's Elaine.

362
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,243
Come on up.

363
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,844
So then what?

364
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,072
Nothing. Then he took me home.

365
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,246
Shake his hand?

366
00:19:13,552 --> 00:19:14,985
Yeah.

367
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,088
What kind of a shake does he have?

368
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:18,920
Good shake. Perfect shake.

369
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,321
Single pump, not too hard.

370
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:25,691
Didn't have to prove anything,
but firm enough to know he was there.

371
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,695
So...

372
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,925
...you're gonna see him again?

373
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,570
He asked me if I was doing anything
Friday night.

374
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,474
The weekend!

375
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:41,344
So then, as I was getting out
of the car--

376
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,946
-Hi!
-Oh, hi, Elaine.

377
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,343
Hi, Elaine.

378
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,450
So how was your date?

379
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,350
What date? It's a guy.

380
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,218
So you know.... He called me.

381
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,357
-Already?
-Keith called you?

382
00:19:57,729 --> 00:19:59,697
This guy really gets around.

383
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:07,031
-Do you mind?
-No, I don't mind. Why should I mind?

384
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,097
What did he say?

385
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,208
He asked me out for Saturday night.

386
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,041
-You going?
-No.

387
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,442
-I told him I was busy.
-Oh, really?

388
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,639
So we're going out Friday.

389
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,151
-Friday?
-Yeah.

390
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,317
He's going out with you on Friday?

391
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,394
-Yeah?
-He's supposed to see me on Friday.

392
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,890
-I didn't know.
-We made plans!

393
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,265
-Well-- I'll cancel it.
-No, don't cancel it.

394
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,566
Well, this is a little
awkward, isn't it?

395
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:46,677
Well, frankly, it is.

396
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,513
I've never seen you jealous before.

397
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,741
Well, you're not even a fan.
I was at game six.

398
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,180
You didn't even watch it.

399
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,184
Wait a second. Wait a minute.

400
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,017
Are you jealous of him
or are you jealous of me?

401
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,089
Any Hennigan's around here?

402
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,032
Vandalay lndustries.

403
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,011
Kell Varnsen speaking.

404
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,709
May we help you?

405
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,548
Oh, hi, Keith.
No, I was just joking around.

406
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,615
No, no, I don't mind at all.

407
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,156
-No, no, no. I can cancel.
-Sure. We'll do something next week.

408
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,157
No, it's no problem at all.

409
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,819
Okay. Take it easy.

410
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:42,093
That was Keith.
We're gonna do something next week.

411
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,330
Hey, what are you doing
Friday night?

412
00:21:44,503 --> 00:21:46,971
Friday night? Nothing. Now.

413
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,171
Want to come to see the baby?

414
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:53,542
Oh, fasten your seat belts.
We're going to see the baby.

415
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,772
If you don't see the baby now,
you're never gonna see her.

416
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,849
-All right, I'll go.
-All right. All right.

417
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,328
I'll get it.

418
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,460
Yello.

419
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:18,568
What delay industries?

420
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:20,136
-No!
-Vandalay!

421
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,567
Say Vandalay!

422
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,004
No, you're way, way, way off!

423
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,838
Yeah, that's the right number,
but this is an apartment.

424
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,242
-No, say--
-Vandalay! Say--

425
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,439
Vandalay lndustries!

426
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:34,478
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

427
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:42,693
How did you know who they wanted?!

428
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:53,596
And you want to be
my latex salesman.

429
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,311
Just sign here, please.

430
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:05,348
I know who it was too.
It was the guy that interviewed me.

431
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,247
He was very threatened by me.
Why else wouldn't he hire me?

432
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,981
-I could sell latex like that.
-Just sign that.

433
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,428
-Who is this?
-It's my daughter.

434
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,935
This is your daughter?

435
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,673
My God!

436
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,968
My God!

437
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,671
I hope you don't mind my saying,
she is breathtaking.

438
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:39,449
You think so?

439
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,314
Would you take this picture away
from me? Just take it away.

440
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,820
Get it out of here.
Take it away, and put it away.

441
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,186
Let me just sign this and go.

442
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,588
You know...

443
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,922
...she doesn't even have a boyfriend.

444
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:54,855
Okay. Okay.

445
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,495
Who do you think you're talking to?

446
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,103
You trying to make a joke,
Mrs. Sokol? It's not funny.

447
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,500
I can tell you that.

448
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:03,440
I'm serious. She doesn't.

449
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:07,111
You know, it's one thing to not
give me the extension.

450
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,476
But to tease and
to torture me like this...

451
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:12,116
...there's no call for that.

452
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,648
Would you like her phone number?

453
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,789
Mrs. Sokol,
I don't know what to say.

454
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,897
-Where should I sign this thing?
-No, no, no, no. Don't worry about it.

455
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,058
Unemployment, it's a tough thing.

456
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:33,295
Even if you get a job after
you've been unemployed...

457
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,839
...they take unemployment out
of your check every week...

458
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:39,977
...and show it to you in that little box.

459
00:24:40,846 --> 00:24:44,441
How good can it be for your
confidence that every paycheck...

460
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:47,710
...has the word "unemployment"
on it?

461
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,921
Can't get it out of your mind!
You just got the job!

462
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:53,421
They're already getting ready
for you to be laid off.

463
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,492
I have a friend who's unemployed.

464
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,457
He's collecting unemployment
insurance.

465
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:03,363
This guy has never worked this hard
in his life to keep this thing going.

466
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:08,896
He's down there every week waiting
on the lines and getting interviewed...

467
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:12,066
...and making up all these lies
about looking for jobs.

468
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:17,773
If they had any idea the effort
and energy that he is expending...

469
00:25:17,949 --> 00:25:21,180
...to avoid work, I'm sure they'd give
him a raise. I'm sure of it.

470
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,249
The guy is doing a tremendous job...

471
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:25,855
...not working.

472
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,893
So tell me more
about this game six.

473
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:33,997
Well, there was two outs,
bottom of the tenth.

474
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:36,895
We're one out away
from losing the series.

475
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,837
Hello. How are you?

476
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,072
So, what do you think?

477
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,444
Do you love her?

478
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:56,086
Yes, I do love her.

479
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,622
You have a very nice place here.

480
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,782
So who do you think she looks like?

481
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,450
Lyndon Johnson.

482
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,054
What? Lyndon Johnson?

483
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,426
He's joking.

484
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,058
No, I'm not joking.
She looks like Lyndon Johnson.

485
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,695
Jerry, I can't believe it took you
so long to see the baby.

486
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:19,241
I kept saying to Michael, "When is
Jerry going to see the baby?"

487
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,001
I was saying the same thing.

488
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,614
Take a picture.
Michael, get the camera.

489
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:27,216
-You don't have to take a picture.
-I don't know where it is.

490
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:30,286
It's in the bottom drawer
of our dresser.

491
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:32,116
Hurry up!

492
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:35,088
He's such an idiot.

493
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,419
Jerry, you want to pick her up?

494
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,429
-I better not.
-I'll pick her up.

495
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,124
No!

496
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:47,334
Thank you for a wonderful time,
George.

497
00:26:47,505 --> 00:26:48,767
Glad you enjoyed it.

498
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,171
I haven't had a Big Mac
in a long time.

499
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,209
Billions and billions.

500
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,445
Would you like to come up?

501
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,515
Would I like to come up?

502
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,483
I would love to come up.

503
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,247
I'm...I'm fighting not to.

504
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:07,050
Fighting.

505
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,894
Unfortunately, l...

506
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:14,521
...I have to get an early start tomorrow.
Gotta get up and hit that pavement.

507
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:17,395
But it's Saturday.
All the offices are closed.

508
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,562
I got me an appointment
with a hardware store.

509
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,265
I'm not saying I want to do it
for the rest of my life...

510
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,376
...but hardware fascinates me.

511
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:28,978
Wouldn't you love to make a key?

512
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,111
Will you call me as soon
as you get home?

513
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:38,482
-Tonight?
-Yes.

514
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:43,219
Will I call you when I get home?
What do you think?

515
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,889
You kill me. You really kill me.

516
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,260
Well, good night.

517
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,909
It was an accident. Right, Jerry?
It was an accident.

518
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,569
Oh, she's gonna be all right.

519
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,242
Here, baby. Here.
Here, baby.

520
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:09,285
Baby, baby, baby.
Who's the baby?

521
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,346
I have a friend who's got a baby.

522
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,358
"Gotta see the baby.

523
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:18,619
You've got to come over
and see the baby."

524
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:24,034
Nobody ever wants you to come over
and see their grandfather, do they?

525
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,194
"You've got to see my grandfather.
You've got to see him.

526
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,272
He's so cute.

527
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:35,107
1 68 pounds, 4 ounces.
I love them when they're this age.

528
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,713
He's 1 000 months.

529
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,715
You know, the mid 80s is such
a good time for the grand-people.

530
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,648
The mid 80s, you gotta see them.

531
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,551
He went to the bathroom
by himself today."

532
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,687
You know what's tough about seeing
people when they have a baby...

533
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:54,093
...is that you have to match
their level of enthusiasm.

534
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,426
You know what I mean?
They're always so excited.

535
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,193
"What do you think of him?"

536
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,303
I'd like to meet a couple that goes:

537
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,805
"You know, we're not that happy
with him, frankly.

538
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:07,411
I think we really made a big mistake.
We should have got an aquarium.

539
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:10,343
You want him? We don't even
want him. You want him?"

540
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:16,178
Thanks for a nice evening.
This was really fun.

541
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,878
Yeah, it was.

542
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,784
Gosh, should I kiss her good night?

543
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,960
Is he going to try and kiss me?

544
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,631
-I love Cajun cooking.
-Really?

545
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,665
You know, my mom's
one-quarter Cajun.

546
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:33,770
Oh, my father's half-drunk.

547
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,000
Maybe they should get together.

548
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,302
Go ahead. Kiss her.

549
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,879
I'm a baseball player, damn it.

550
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,643
What's he waiting for?

551
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:48,786
I thought he was a cool guy.

552
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:54,290
Come on. I won the MVP in '79.
I can do whatever I want to.

553
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,728
Well, this is getting awkward.

554
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,559
Well, good night.

555
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:04,997
Good night.

556
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:13,142
Who does this guy think he is?

557
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,404
I'm Keith Hernandez.

558
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:19,577
Who else?

559
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,253
Mookie. Mookie was there.

560
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,081
You know him?

561
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,653
Well, I don't know him.
I know who he is.

562
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,958
He's such a great guy.
You should meet him.

563
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:34,656
-He's the one who got that hit--
-I know. He got the hit in game six!

564
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,033
So then what happened?

565
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,334
Nothing. The he took me home.

566
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,703
So did you two...

567
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:48,507
...have....

568
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:51,843
What?

569
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:55,014
You know.

570
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,847
Milk?

571
00:30:59,757 --> 00:31:02,851
-No.
-Cookies?

572
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,190
Did he kiss you good night?

573
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,197
I don't know.

574
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,231
What do you mean, you don't know?

575
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:15,000
All right. He kissed me, okay?

576
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,697
Well, what kind of a kiss?

577
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:21,039
Was it a peck? Was it a kiss?
Was it a long make-out thing?

578
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:24,039
Between a peck and a make-out.

579
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,417
So you like him.

580
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,114
I don't understand.
Before you were jealous of me.

581
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,721
Now you're jealous of him?

582
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,620
I'm jealous of everybody.

583
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:41,529
Hello.

584
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,724
Oh, hi. What's happening?

585
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,200
What?

586
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,736
Sure.

587
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,738
Yeah, okay.

588
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,642
Then.... I'll see you then.

589
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,111
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

590
00:31:58,283 --> 00:31:59,511
Bye.

591
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,583
-Who was that?
-That was Keith.

592
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:06,920
-What's going on?
-He wants me to help him move.

593
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,393
Help him move?

594
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:11,926
Move what?

595
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,724
You know, furniture.

596
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:18,096
So, what did you say?

597
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,737
I said, yes, but I don't feel right
about it.

598
00:32:20,905 --> 00:32:23,271
I mean, I hardly know the guy.

599
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,274
That's a big step
in a male relationship.

600
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,345
The biggest.
That's like going all the way.

601
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,778
And you feel you're not
really ready for--

602
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,682
Well, we went out one time.

603
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:39,721
Don't you think that's coming on
a little too strong?

604
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,554
Hey.

605
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,121
What's going on?

606
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,096
Keith Hernandez just asked me
to help him move.

607
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:50,865
What?

608
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,600
Well, you hardly know the guy.

609
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,737
What a nerve!

610
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,879
You see? Wasn't I right
about this guy? Didn't I tell you?

611
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,315
Oh, you're not gonna do it, are you?

612
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,680
-I said, yes.
-You said yes?!

613
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,986
Don't you have any pride
or self-respect?

614
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,489
I mean, how can you prostitute
yourself like this?

615
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,821
Are you gonna start driving him
to the airport?

616
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:20,163
I'm not driving him to the airport.

617
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,128
Oh, boy. I don't know.

618
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,101
-Kramer, do me a favor, would you?
-What?

619
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,668
Don't mention it to anybody.

620
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,238
I wish you never mentioned it to me.

621
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,085
I had a great time tonight, Carrie.

622
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:45,415
And I will call you
as soon as I get home.

623
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,251
Don't bother.

624
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,554
Bother? What kind of bother?

625
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:52,195
I would prefer it if you didn't.

626
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,029
-Why? Is anything wrong?
-It's over, buddy. Done.

627
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,035
Finished. So long. Goodbye.
Adios. Sayonara.

628
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,074
-Why?
-I've been thinking about it.

629
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,369
You got no job.
You got no prospects.

630
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,637
You're like Biff Loman.

631
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,749
I went to the hardware store
interview.

632
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:15,283
You think I'm going to spend my life
with somebody...

633
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:18,581
...because he can get me a deal
on a box of nails?

634
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,217
I thought we were a team.

635
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,453
If I ever need a drill bit, I'll call you.

636
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:26,392
Carrie, could you do me a favor?

637
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,998
Could you not mention this
to your mother?

638
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,000
You know, I hate to brag...

639
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,841
...but I did win 1 1 straight
Gold Gloves.

640
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,569
I wouldn't have brought it up,
but since you mentioned it.

641
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,808
I didn't mention it.

642
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,582
Well, I won them anyway.

643
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,347
Well, so what? I mean...

644
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,646
...you played first base.

645
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,290
I mean, they always put
the worst player at first base.

646
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:56,291
That's where they put me,
and I stunk.

647
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:01,561
Elaine, you don't know the first thing
about first base.

648
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:05,827
Well, I know something
about getting to first base...

649
00:35:06,003 --> 00:35:08,631
...and I know you'll never be there.

650
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,031
The way I figure it,
I've already been there.

651
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:14,303
And I plan on rounding second
tonight at around 1 1 :00.

652
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,811
Well, I'd watch the third-base coach
if I were you...

653
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:23,044
...because I don't think
he's waving you in.

654
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:28,983
You know, I hate to say this...

655
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,924
...but I really think that
we're hitting it off.

656
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:35,031
-Get it? Get it?
-Clever.

657
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:40,469
-What are you doing?
-What's that?

658
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,131
-You smoke?
-Yeah.

659
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:46,142
I didn't know you smoked.

660
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,002
Is that a problem?

661
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,679
She likes him.
I mean, she really likes him.

662
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:58,719
-How do you know?
-Who wouldn't like him?

663
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,323
I like him, and I'm a guy.

664
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,493
I suppose he's an attractive man.

665
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,755
Forget that. He's a ballplayer.
MVP, 1979.

666
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:10,697
I'm making wisecracks in some
nightclub. This guy was in game six.

667
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:13,000
They're a perfect match.
They go together.

668
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,901
Like one of these brother and sister
couples that look alike.

669
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:19,565
I hate those couples. I could never be
one of those couples.

670
00:36:19,744 --> 00:36:22,611
There are no bald women around,
you know.

671
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,379
I know this sounds a little arrogant,
but I never thought she'd find...

672
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,147
...someone she liked better
than me. But, you know...

673
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:33,688
...I guess I had my chance.
And that's that.

674
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,621
You know what I'd like to do?

675
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,994
I'd really like to have sex
with a tall woman.

676
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:43,122
I mean really tall, like a giant.
Like 6'5".

677
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:45,229
Really?

678
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,667
What was the tallest woman
you ever slept with?

679
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,396
I don't know, 6'3".

680
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:52,338
Wow! God!

681
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:55,973
See, this is all I think about:
Sleeping with a giant.

682
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:59,146
It's my life's ambition.

683
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:02,980
So I guess it's fair to say you've set
different goals for yourself than...

684
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,952
...say, Thomas Edison, Magellan,
these type of people.

685
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,284
Magellan? You like Magellan?

686
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:11,986
Oh, yeah. My favorite explorer.
Around the world. Come on.

687
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,991
-Who do you like?
-I like de Soto.

688
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,100
-De Soto? What did he do?
-Discovered the Mississippi.

689
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:20,793
Oh, like they wouldn't have found
that anyway.

690
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:25,907
All right. I gotta go down
to the unemployment office.

691
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,671
-You want to take a walk?
-No, I got some stuff to do.

692
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:31,815
I gotta meet Keith at my apartment
at 3. I'm helping him move.

693
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:33,683
What?

694
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:37,577
The guy asked you to help him move?
Wow!

695
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,054
-I know. Isn't that something?
-Why doesn't he just pay a mover?

696
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:44,991
He's got some valuable antiques.
He's worried they'll break something.

697
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:47,923
Soon he'll have you driving him
to the airport.

698
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,659
I'm not driving him to the airport!

699
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,874
I gave. I gave everything I could,
Mrs. Sokol.

700
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,875
-Nothing was good enough for her.
-Sign here, please.

701
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:03,775
I don't know who she's looking for.
I don't know.

702
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:07,349
I'll tell you, she's very particular,
your daughter. Very particular.

703
00:38:07,518 --> 00:38:09,679
Is she looking for some
big hotshot businessman?

704
00:38:09,854 --> 00:38:12,414
Well, I've got my pride too.
I'm not gonna beg her.

705
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:15,354
All right. Just sign it.
People are waiting.

706
00:38:22,433 --> 00:38:23,661
You like baseball?

707
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,032
That was autographed
by the '86 Mets.

708
00:38:27,204 --> 00:38:29,195
I saw every inning that year.

709
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:34,473
It's funny, because I happen to be
very good friends with...

710
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,670
...Keith Hernandez.

711
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:39,509
You know Keith Hernandez.

712
00:38:39,684 --> 00:38:41,117
Know him?

713
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:43,977
Would you...Iike to meet him?

714
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:46,650
Oh, come on. Come on.

715
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:50,160
I can produce Keith Hernandez,
right here...

716
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,159
...within the hour.

717
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:53,920
All right.

718
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:56,433
You got one hour.

719
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,029
All right, Mrs. S.

720
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:04,831
I and my good pal
Keith Hernandez...

721
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,971
...will be right back.

722
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,888
129 West 81st Street, and hurry.

723
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,264
Or not.

724
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:36,395
You better bring your gloves.
It's freezing out there.

725
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:40,601
It shouldn't take too long.
I'd say maybe, oh, four hours.

726
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:45,543
Really, Jerry, there's not that much.
First, we got the bedroom.

727
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,809
We got two dressers and the bed.

728
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:51,387
-ls there a box spring?
-What's that?

729
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,648
-A box spring?
-Yeah, there's a box spring.

730
00:39:53,824 --> 00:39:57,316
But it's attached to the headboard,
and we'll have to take that apart.

731
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,019
Then we got the couch.

732
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:02,393
-ls that a sectional?
-Yeah, 1 2 pieces.

733
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:06,297
-A marble coffee table.
-ls that a thick marble?

734
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,165
Three inches thick.
Got it in ltaly.

735
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,037
But the big problem is gonna be
the convertible sofa.

736
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,939
When you move it,
it tends to open up...

737
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:17,637
...so it's going to be difficult
getting it downstairs.

738
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,245
Stairs?

739
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,979
-There's no elevator?
-No, it's a brownstone. Three floors.

740
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,619
-I'm sorry, I can't do this.
-What?

741
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:34,458
I can't do it! I can't!
It's too soon.

742
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:36,725
I don't know you.

743
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:41,303
I can't help you move, I'm sorry.
I can't! I just can't.

744
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,880
-Hello.
-Hello.

745
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,249
Oh, you don't remember me.

746
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,524
-No. Should l?
-Yeah, yeah, you should...

747
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,716
...because I certainly remember you.

748
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,792
Let me refresh your memory.

749
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,291
June 14th, 1987.

750
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:13,733
Mets-Phillies. You made a big error.
Cost the Mets the game.

751
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,134
Then you're coming up
the parking lot ramp.

752
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,798
You said, "Nice game, pretty boy."

753
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,977
-You remember.
-And then you spit on us.

754
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,012
-Hey, I didn't spit at you.
-Yeah, right.

755
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:28,083
-No, no. Then who was it?
-Look, the way I remember it...

756
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:31,278
...I was walking up the ramp.
I was upset about the game.

757
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:33,389
That's when you called me
"pretty boy. "

758
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:36,424
Hey, that ticked me off.
I was turning to say something...

759
00:41:36,894 --> 00:41:38,555
...and as I turned around...

760
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:44,426
...I saw Roger McDowell behind
the bushes over by that gravelly road.

761
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:52,171
Anyway, he was talking to someone,
and they were pointing at you.

762
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,368
I tried to scream out,
but it was too late.

763
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,069
It was already on its way.

764
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,507
I told you.

765
00:41:59,783 --> 00:42:04,220
-It was McDowell.
-But why? Why McDowell?

766
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:08,083
Maybe because we were sitting
in the right-field stands...

767
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,659
...cursing at him in the bullpen
all game.

768
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:14,254
He must have caught a glimpse of us
when I poured that beer on his head.

769
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,964
-lt was McDowell.
-Oh, boy.

770
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:23,429
-Look, Keith, we're sorry.
-Yeah, I couldn't be sorrier.

771
00:42:23,607 --> 00:42:25,734
Guys, don't worry about it.

772
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,970
-Well, I guess I better get going.
-What are you doing?

773
00:42:29,146 --> 00:42:31,614
-I gotta move.
-You want any help?

774
00:42:32,483 --> 00:42:34,644
-I'd love some. You sure?
-I'd love to help you.

775
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:36,080
Yeah, me too!

776
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,244
Okay, guys. We got to be careful
of one thing.

777
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:41,755
Some of the stuff is very fragile
We'll have to handle it like a baby.

778
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,723
Hey, no sweat.

779
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,635
Hello.

780
00:42:57,808 --> 00:43:00,504
Oh, hi, Elaine. What's going on?

781
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:02,305
No, he just left.

782
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:04,037
You broke up with him?

783
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:05,841
Me too!

784
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,447
What happened?

785
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,920
Oh, smoking. You know, you're like
going out with C. Everett Koop.

786
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:17,192
Me? No.
I couldn't go through with it.

787
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:19,454
I just didn't feel ready.

788
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:21,598
So, what are you doing now?

789
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,431
Oh, great idea. Okay.

790
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,398
I'll meet you there in, like,
30 minutes.

791
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:27,230
Okay, bye.

792
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:30,199
Keith! Keith!

793
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:33,832
-What happened? Where's Keith?
-You just missed him. He just left.

794
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,845
What do you need him for?

795
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,747
Keith! Keith! Up here!

796
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,545
Look, could you do me a favor?

797
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,052
I need you to go to the
unemployment office with me!

798
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:47,189
I-- I'm Jerry's friend!

799
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,292
The guy from the locker room!

800
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,087
I'm the chucker!

801
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,320
It'll take five minutes!

802
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,523
Wait! Wait!

803
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:11,146
Well, Biff...

804
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:15,150
...what's next?

805
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:17,581
I don't know.

806
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,586
Excuse me.

807
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,386
I was walking behind you, and you...

808
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:25,823
...dropped your wallet.

809
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,630
When you're moving,
your whole world becomes boxes.

810
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:36,000
That's all you think about,
is boxes. Where are there boxes?

811
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,165
You just wander down the street,
going in and out of stores.

812
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,471
"Are there boxes here?
Have you seen any boxes?"

813
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:46,047
I mean, you can't even talk to people
because you can't concentrate.

814
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:49,344
"Shut up! I'm looking for boxes!"

815
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:53,150
So after a while, you become
really into it. You can smell them.

816
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,881
You walk into a store:

817
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,152
"There's boxes here.

818
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:01,286
Don't tell me you don't have boxes.
Damn it! I can smell them!"

819
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:03,627
You become, like, obsessed.

820
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,929
"l love the smell of cardboard
in the morning."

821
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:10,369
At a funeral, everyone's crying around.
You're looking at the casket:

822
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,304
"That's a nice box.

823
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,240
Does anybody know where
that guy got that box?

824
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:18,677
When he's done with it,
you think I could get that?

825
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,942
It's got some nice handles on it."

826
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:25,550
And that's what death is, really.
It's the last big move of your life.

827
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,213
The hearse is like the van.

828
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,949
The pallbearers are close friends.

829
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:32,493
The only ones you could really ask
to help you with a big move like that.

830
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:34,756
And the casket is that great,
perfect box...

831
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:36,832
...you've been looking for
your whole life.

832
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,798
The only problem is
once you find it, you're in it.
