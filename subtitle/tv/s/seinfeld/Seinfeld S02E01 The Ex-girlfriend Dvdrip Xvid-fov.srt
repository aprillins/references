1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,200
I'm always in traffic
with the lane expert.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,800
Do you know this type of person?
Constantly re-evaluating...

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
...their lane choice.
Never quite sure:

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,200
"Is this the best lane for me,
for my life?"

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,000
They're always a little bit ahead.
"Can I get in over there?

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,400
Can I get ahead of you?"

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,300
Yeah, come on over here, pal.
We're zooming over here.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,900
This is the secret lane,
nobody knows about it.

9
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,500
The ultimate... I think the ultimate
psychological test of traffic...

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,200
...is the total dead stop.
Not even rolling...

11
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,700
...and you look out the window,
you see gum clearly.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,900
But we know that in the future,
traffic will get even worse than that.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,300
What will happen? Will it start
moving backwards? Is that possible?

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,000
That someday we'll be going, " Boy,
this is some really bad traffic now.

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,700
This is really bad.

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,900
I'm gonna try and get off,
and get back on going the other way."

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:02,300
- She can't kill me, right?
- No, of course not.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,200
- People break up all the time.
- Every day.

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,200
It just didn't work out.
What can I do?

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,100
I wanted to love her.
I tried to love her. I couldn't.

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,300
You tried.

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,100
I'd be looking at her face, I'd go,
"Come on. Love her. Love her."

23
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,400
- Did you tell her you loved her?
- I had no choice.

24
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,700
She squeezed it out of me.

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,200
She'd tell me she loved me. All right,
so at first, I'd just look at her.

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,400
I'd go, "Oh, really?"

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,000
Or, " Boy, that's...
That's something."

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,400
But eventually,
you have to come back with:

29
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,600
"Well, I love you." You know,
you can only hold out for so long.

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,900
- You're a human being.
- I didn't even ask her out.

31
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,300
She asked me out first.
She called me up.

32
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,600
What was I supposed to do, say no?
I can't do that to someone.

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,800
- You're too nice a guy.
- I am. I'm a nice guy.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,300
And then she seduced me.

35
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,200
We're in my apartment,
I'm on the couch, she's on the chair.

36
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,500
I get up to go to the bathroom,
I come back...

37
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,900
...she's on the couch.

38
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,400
What am I supposed to do?
Not do anything?

39
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,200
I couldn't. I would've insulted her.

40
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,500
- You're flesh and blood.
- I had nothing to do with any of this.

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,600
I met all her friends.

42
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,100
I didn't want to meet them.
I kept trying to avoid it.

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,000
I knew it would only
get me in deeper.

44
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,900
But they were everywhere. They
kept popping up all over the place.

45
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,800
"This is Nancy, Susan, Amy,
my cousin, my brother, my father."

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,700
- It's like I'm in quicksand here.
- I told you when I met her.

47
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,100
My back is killing me.

48
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,400
You gotta go to my chiropractor.
He's the best.

49
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,300
- Everybody's guy is the best.
- I'll make an appointment for you.

50
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,700
- We'll go together.
- Please, they don't do anything.

51
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,300
Do I have to break up with her in
person? Can't I do it over the phone?

52
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,400
- I have no stomach for these things.
- Do it like a Band-Aid.

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,300
One motion, right off!

54
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,700
- Hi.
- Hi.

55
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,700
- What are you doing?
- I'm letting you in.

56
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,900
No, I don't want to sit in back.
I'll be left out of the conversation.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,700
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will, George.

58
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,500
I'll have to stick my chin
on top of the seat.

59
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,100
- Okay.
- Why can't you sit in the middle?

60
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,600
Please. It doesn't look good.
Boy, boy, girl.

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,700
I think you're afraid
to sit next to a man.

62
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,300
You're a little homophobic,
aren't you?

63
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,500
Is it that obvious?

64
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,800
- Hello, Jerry.
- Hello.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,300
- Did you get a haircut?
- Nope. Shower.

66
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,600
So where are we eating?

67
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,600
Tell me if you think this is strange.
There's this guy...

68
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,800
...who lives in my building who I was
introduced to a couple years ago.

69
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,400
He's a teacher or something.

70
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,600
Anyway, after we met, whenever
we'd run into each other in the street...

71
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,300
...or in the lobby, or whatever...

72
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,700
...we would stop and chat a little bit.
Nothing much. Little pleasantries.

73
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
He's a nice guy. He's got a family.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,800
Then after a while,
I noticed there was...

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
...no more stopping, just saying hello
and continuing on our way.

76
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
And then the verbal hellos stopped...

77
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,400
...and we just went into these
little sort of nods of recognition.

78
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,100
So fine, I figure, that's where this
relationship is finally gonna settle.

79
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,500
Polite nodding.

80
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,000
Then one day...

81
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,100
...he doesn't nod.

82
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,700
Like I don't exist?

83
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
He went from nods to nothing.

84
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,900
Now there's this intense animosity
whenever we pass.

85
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,000
I mean, it's like we really hate
each other. It's based on nothing.

86
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,900
A relationship is an organism.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,800
You created this thing...

88
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,200
...and then you starved it,
so it turned against you.

89
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,100
Same thing happened in The Blob.

90
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,400
I think you absolutely have to say
something to this guy. Confront him.

91
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
- Really?
- Yes.

92
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,600
- Would you do that?
- lf I was a different person.

93
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,100
Hello?

94
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,200
Hello, is Glen there?

95
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,300
I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?

96
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes, I know I have the wrong number.
I want to know if I dialled wrong or...

97
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,000
Why do people do that?

98
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,200
Come on up.

99
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,800
Oh, it's you again. See?

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,200
If you'd answered me,
I wouldn't have had to do this.

101
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,900
That's two long-distance calls
I've made to you. Why can't you...?

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,600
Why? Why do they just
hang up like that?

103
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Thank you very much.

104
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,600
- Taste this.
- No, I just had a sandwich.

105
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,700
- No, taste it.
- I don't want cantaloupe now.

106
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,400
- You never had it like this before.
- I only eat cantaloupe...

107
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,100
- Jerry, this is great cantaloupe.
- All right.

108
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
- It's very good. It's good.
- It's good, huh?

109
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,900
I got it at Joe's, 49 cents a pound.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,800
That's practically half than what
you pay at the supermarket.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,600
I don't know why
you don't go to Joe's.

112
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,500
It's too far.

113
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,400
It's three blocks further.
You could use my shopping cart.

114
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm not pulling a shopping cart.

115
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,600
Am I supposed to wear a kerchief...

116
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,600
...put stockings on
rolled below my knee?

117
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
The other thing is,
if you don't like anything...

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,900
...he takes it back.
- I don't return fruit.

119
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,300
Fruit's a gamble.

120
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,200
I know that going in.

121
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,800
I did it! It's over.

122
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,500
- You did it? What happened?
- I told her, in the kitchen.

123
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,900
Which was risky,
because it's near all the knives.

124
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,100
I started with the word "listen."
I said:

125
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,600
"Listen, Marlene." The next thing
I know, I'm in the middle of it.

126
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,600
There's this voice inside me going,
"You're doing it."

127
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,000
Then she started to cry,
and I weakened a little bit.

128
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,500
I almost relented, but the voice,
Jerry, the voice said:

129
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,400
"Keep going. Keep going.
You're almost out."

130
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,200
It's like I was making a prison break.

131
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,800
I'm heading for the wall.

132
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,700
And I trip and twist my ankle and they
throw that light on you. You know?

133
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,200
Somehow I get through the crying
and I keep running.

134
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,800
Then the cursing started.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
She's firing at me
from the guard towers.

136
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,800
"Son of a..." Bang!
"Son of a..." Boom!

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,200
I get to the top of the wall,
the front door...

138
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,900
...I open it up, I'm one foot away.

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,100
I take one last look around
the penitentiary, and I jump!

140
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,700
See? Never as bad as you imagine.

141
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,300
I like that Marlene.

142
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,700
What's her number?

143
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,400
Yeah, no, l... I don't think so.

144
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,500
Could you stop that smacking?

145
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,800
George, I want you to taste
this cantaloupe.

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,200
- No, thank you.
- It's the best cantaloupe I've had.

147
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,900
- No, really.
- I'll get you a piece.

148
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,200
- Jerry, tell him how good it is.
- Very good cantaloupe.

149
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,100
So that's it. You're out.

150
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,300
Except for one small problem.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,100
I left some books in her apartment.

152
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,900
So? Go get them.

153
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,600
No, I can't go back there.
Jerry, it's so awkward.

154
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,100
It could be dangerous, sexually.
Something could happen.

155
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,800
I'd be right back where I started from.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,700
So forget about the books.

157
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,000
- Did you read them?
- Well, yeah.

158
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,600
What do you need them for?

159
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,700
I don't know. They're books.

160
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,900
What is this obsession
people have with books?

161
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,400
They put them in their houses
like they're trophies.

162
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,600
What do you need it for
after you read it?

163
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,300
They're my books.

164
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,900
So you want me to get the books,
is that it?

165
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,900
So it must have been 95 degrees
that night...

166
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,000
...and everyone's standing around the
pool with little drinks in their hands.

167
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,100
I was wearing my old jeans
and T-shirt.

168
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,900
I don't know, I was just
in one of those moods...

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,200
...so I said to myself, " Marlene,
just do it." And I jumped in.

170
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,400
As I'm getting out,
I feel all these eyes on me.

171
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,500
So I look up,
and everyone is just staring at me.

172
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,900
So, what did you do?

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,800
Well, nothing. It's no skin off my hide
if people like to look.

174
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,100
I just didn't see what
the big attraction was.

175
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Well, I have a general idea
what it was.

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,600
I could take a guess.

177
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,000
Hey, you know, Jerry...

178
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,500
...just because George
and I don't see each other...

179
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,300
...doesn't mean we shouldn't
stay friends.

180
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,200
No.

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,500
Good enough. I'm really glad
we got that settled.

182
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,800
Great.

183
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,400
I don't know how this happened.

184
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Jerry, it's not my fault.

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,800
No, it's not your fault.

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,900
"Books, books, I need my books."

187
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Have you reread those books yet,
by the way?

188
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,800
The great thing, when you read
Moby Dick the second time...

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,800
...Ahab and the whale
become good friends.

190
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,100
It's not like Marlene's
a bad person or anything...

191
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,200
...but, my God, we've had
three lunches and a movie...

192
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,000
...and she never stops calling.

193
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,100
And it's those meaningless,
purposeless, blather calls.

194
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,300
She never asks if I'm busy
or anything.

195
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,200
I just pick up the phone
and she's in the middle of a sentence.

196
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,600
It's standard.

197
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,200
Has she left you a message...

198
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,800
...where she uses up
the whole machine?

199
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,900
You know, sometimes
she'll go, "Hello, Jerry?"

200
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,300
And I'll go, "Oh, hi, Marlene."

201
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,600
And then it's, "Jerry...

202
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,700
...I don't know sometimes."
- "Know sometimes."

203
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,400
What about trying
to get off the phone?

204
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,700
You can't. It's impossible.

205
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,900
There's no break in the conversation
where you can go:

206
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,600
"All right, then."

207
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,700
You know, it just goes on and on
without a break in the wall.

208
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,600
I mean, I've gotta put a stop to this.

209
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,500
Just do it like a Band-Aid.
One motion. Right off!

210
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,600
She is sexy, though.

211
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,600
- Don't you think?
- Yeah.

212
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,100
Yeah, she is.

213
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
- Mr. Costanza?
- Yeah?

214
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,400
The doctor will see you now.

215
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Yeah. "Doctor."

216
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm gonna have to wait in that
little room all by myself, aren't I?

217
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,500
I better take this.

218
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
I hate the little room.

219
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,400
Oh, hello, doctor.

220
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,400
Waiting room. I hate when they
make you wait in the room.

221
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,000
Because it says waiting room.

222
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,800
There's no chance of not waiting...

223
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,800
...because they call it the waiting
room. They're gonna use it.

224
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,700
It's all set up for you to wait.

225
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,900
You sit there and you got
your little magazine.

226
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,000
You pretend you read it, but you're
really looking at other people.

227
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,200
You know, you're thinking
about them. Things like:

228
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,500
"I wonder what he's got."

229
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,500
And, "Soon as she goes,
I'm getting her magazine."

230
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,000
Then they finally call you,
and it's a very exciting moment.

231
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,600
They finally call you.

232
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,400
You stand up and kind of look
around at the other people.

233
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,600
"Well, I guess I've been chosen.

234
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,600
I'll see you all later."

235
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,800
You think you're gonna see the doctor,
but you're not, are you? No.

236
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You're going into
the next waiting room.

237
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
The littler waiting room.

238
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,200
But if they are doing some
sort of medical thing to you...

239
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,500
...you want to be in the smallest room
that they have. I think.

240
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,100
You don't want to be in
the largest room that they have.

241
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,900
You ever see these operating
theatres that they have...

242
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,800
...with, like, stadium seating?

243
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,600
You don't want them
doing anything...

244
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,300
...that makes other doctors go,
"I have to see this.

245
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,900
Are you kidding? Are they
gonna really do that to him?

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,600
Are there seats? Can we get in?"

247
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,800
Do they scalp tickets
to these things?

248
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,800
"I got two for the Winslow tumour.
I got two."

249
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,900
So how was it?

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I was in there for two minutes.
He didn't do anything.

251
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Touch this, feel that. 75 bucks.

252
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,600
Well, it's a first visit.

253
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,400
What's 75 bucks?

254
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,200
What, am I seeing Sinatra in there?

255
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,000
Am I being entertained?
I don't understand this.

256
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,300
I'm only paying half.

257
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,200
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

258
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,200
He's a doctor.
You gotta pay what he says.

259
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,200
No, no, no. I pay what I say.

260
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,500
You feeling weird?

261
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,800
No.

262
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,800
I'm fine.

263
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,800
- Nothing really happened.
- Yeah.

264
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,800
I know.

265
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,200
We just kissed a little.

266
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,000
People kiss.

267
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,200
Yeah.

268
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,400
Well...

269
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,500
Night.

270
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,000
Good night.

271
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,000
- Hey.
- Hey.

272
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
- I got it. This time I got it.
- All right.

273
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,000
Hips. See, it's all in the hips.

274
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,700
Gotta come through
with the hips first.

275
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,700
That is out there.

276
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,700
Definitely.

277
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,000
- Joe's?
- No. Supermarket.

278
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,900
Well, is it good?

279
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,600
- It's... It's okay.
- Let me taste that.

280
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,800
See? That stinks.

281
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,700
- You can't eat that. Take that back.
- I'm not taking it back.

282
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,900
- I'll take it back.
- I don't care about it.

283
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,000
You should care. Cantaloupe
like this should be out of circulation.

284
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,800
All right. Take it back.

285
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,500
- No.
- Leave a message. I'll call you back.

286
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,800
Jerry, have you ever
tak en a bath in the dark?

287
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,200
I'm not talking into the soap
right now.

288
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,500
Call me back.

289
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,000
Who was that?

290
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,000
- Marlene.
- Mar...

291
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,500
- Marlene.
- Yeah.

292
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,500
I took her home one night.
We started up a little in the car.

293
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,800
- I thought you were getting rid of her.
- I was.

294
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,600
But she's got me, like, hypnotized
or something.

295
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,600
- Does George know?
- No. He'd go nuts.

296
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,800
Yeah, no kidding.

297
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,500
I feel terrible.

298
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,200
I've seen her a couple
of times since then...

299
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,400
...and I know I can't go
any further, but...

300
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,100
She's got this psychosexual
hold over me. I just want her.

301
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,100
I can't breathe. It's like a drug.

302
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Psychosexual.

303
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
I don't know how I'm gonna tell him.

304
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,900
Man, I don't understand people.

305
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,300
Why would George want
to deprive you of pleasure?

306
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,000
Is it just me?

307
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,400
It's partially you, yeah.

308
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,200
You're his friend.

309
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
Better that she should sleep
with someone else?

310
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,300
Some jerk that he doesn't even know?

311
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
- He can't kill me, right?
- You're a human being.

312
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,600
She called me. I never called her.
She started it.

313
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,800
- You're flesh and blood.
- I'm a nice guy.

314
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,800
- Hi.
- Hi, Elaine.

315
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,500
My little airplane lamp.

316
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,700
You have the slowest elevator
in the entire city.

317
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,500
That's hard to get used to when
you're on so many fast ones.

318
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,100
Apartment elevators are always
slower than offices...

319
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,400
...because you don't have
to be home on time.

320
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,800
- Unless you're married to a dictator.
- Yeah.

321
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,700
Because they'd be very
demanding people.

322
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,800
Right. Exactly.

323
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,600
I imagine at some point somebody's
gonna offer me some cantaloupe?

324
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,300
No. No good.

325
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,500
Well, you know what they say,
lucky in love, unlucky with fruit.

326
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,200
Well, I'm taking this back.

327
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,000
So I had what you might call
a little encounter this morning.

328
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,900
Really? That guy
who stopped saying hello?

329
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,300
- Yes.
- You talk to him?

330
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,200
Yes. I spotted him getting his mail.

331
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,600
At first I was just gonna walk on by
but then I thought, " No, no.

332
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,900
- Do not be afraid of this man."
- Right.

333
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,900
So I walked up behind him, tapped
him on the shoulder and said:

334
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,100
"Hi, remember me?"

335
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,300
And he furrows his brow...

336
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,000
...as if he's really trying
to figure it out.

337
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,300
So I said to him...
I said, "You little phoney.

338
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,000
You know exactly who I am."

339
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,500
- You said, "You little phoney"?
- I did. I most certainly did.

340
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And he goes, "Oh, yeah, you're
Jeanette's friend. We did meet once."

341
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,000
I said, " How do you go from that
to totally ignoring a person...

342
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,000
...when they walk by?"
- This is amazing.

343
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,500
And he says, " Look, I just didn't
want to say hello anymore, all right?"

344
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,200
And I said, " Fine. I didn't want
to say hello anymore either.

345
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,200
But I just wanted you to know
that I'm aware of it."

346
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,100
You are the queen of confrontation.

347
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,400
You're my new hero.

348
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,800
You've inspired me. I'm gonna call
George about something right now.

349
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,000
This cantaloupe stinks.

350
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,400
I don't care.

351
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,800
- You're kidding.
- No, I don't care.

352
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,600
- You mean that?
- Absolutely.

353
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,500
- You don't care?
- No.

354
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,300
- How could you not care?
- I don't know, but I don't.

355
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Actually, I'm almost happy to hear it.

356
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:09,000
- I thought you'd be upset.
- I guess I should be, but I'm not.

357
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Am I a bad person?
Did I do something terrible?

358
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,800
You're a fine person.
You're a humanitarian.

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,300
She's very sexy.

360
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,500
- That voice. She's driving me crazy.
- I know. I know.

361
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,400
I can see her tonight
and you don't care?

362
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,600
See her tonight. See her tomorrow.
Go, knock yourself out.

363
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,900
- She's too crazy for me.
- All right. As long as you're okay.

364
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,600
- I can't stop thinking about it.
- I'm okay. I'm fine.

365
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,600
I'm wonderful. I never
felt better in my whole life.

366
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,400
Good.

367
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,400
I'll tell you what.

368
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,000
You don't have to pay the $35
I gave the chiropractor...

369
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,700
...for the rest of your bill.

370
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,700
You paid that crook?

371
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,100
- I had to.
- He didn't do anything, Jerry.

372
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,600
- It's a scam. Who told you to do that?
- It was embarrassing to me.

373
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,600
I was trying to make a point.

374
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,600
Why don't you make a point
with your own doctor?

375
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,900
What's wrong?

376
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
- I think I swallowed a fly.
- Oh, God.

377
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,000
I swallowed a fly!

378
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,900
What do I do?

379
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,100
What can happen?

380
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,100
So you want to come up
for a few minutes?

381
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
I'm sorry, Jerry. I just don't
think this is gonna work.

382
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,400
Really?

383
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,200
- I thought...
- I know.

384
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,800
I'm sorry.

385
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,700
I just didn't expect it from the way
you've been acting.

386
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,800
Are you sure you want to talk
about this? I sure don't.

387
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,300
Of course I want to talk about it.

388
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,200
Well, okay.

389
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,200
I guess things changed for me
on Tuesday night.

390
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,600
Tuesday night?
What happened Tuesday night?

391
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,000
I saw your act.

392
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,200
My act? What does that
have to do with anything?

393
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,200
Well, to be honest...

394
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,500
...it just didn't make it for me.

395
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,200
It's just so much fluff.

396
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,800
I can't believe this.

397
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,600
What are you saying?
You didn't like my act?

398
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,000
So that's it?

399
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,100
I can't be with someone
if I don't respect what they do.

400
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,800
You're a cashier.

401
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,000
Look, Jerry, it just wasn't
my kind of humour.

402
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,100
You can't go by the audience.
It was late, they were terrible.

403
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,500
I heard the material.

404
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,900
I have other stuff.

405
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,300
You should come see me
on the weekend.

406
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,100
Women need to like the job
of the guy they're with.

407
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,100
If they don't like the job,
they don't like the guy.

408
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,600
Men know this.

409
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,900
Which is why we make up the phoney,
bogus names for the jobs we have.

410
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,200
"Right now, I'm the regional
management supervisor.

411
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,400
I'm in development,
research, consulting."

412
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,800
Men, on the other hand, if they are
physically attracted to a woman...

413
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,100
...are not that concerned
with her job, are we?

414
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,500
Men don't really care.

415
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,200
Men just go, " Really, slaughterhouse?
That where you work? Interesting.

416
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,700
You got a big cleaver, just lopping
their heads off? Sounds great.

417
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,500
Listen, why don't you shower up...

418
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,700
...and we'll get some burgers
and catch a movie."
