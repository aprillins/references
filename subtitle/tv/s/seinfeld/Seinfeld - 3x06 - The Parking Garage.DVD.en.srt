1
00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:04,353
It's hard to find a store in a mall.
They have a directory...

2
00:00:05,863 --> 00:00:09,158
...but the problem with it is,
even if you figure out where you are...

3
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:11,206
...and where you wanna go...

4
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:14,400
...you still don't really know,
sometimes, which way to walk...

5
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:16,835
...because it's an upright map.

6
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:20,544
lf you had, like, suction-cup feet,
then you could just walk right up on it.

7
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:24,420
Then you could tell, you could be
on it going, ''All right, I'm here.

8
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:26,371
I wanna go to the Gap.
That's down there.

9
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:28,061
All right, I'll just walk that way.''

10
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:35,235
But people would know. They would
see you walking down the mall going:

11
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,467
They'd go, ''That's one
of those suction-cup guys.

12
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:42,339
I heard about that guy.
He's never lost.''

13
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:47,546
One left. What a joke.

14
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:49,921
-You can have this one.
-That's not enough BTUs...

15
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:52,506
...for my living room.
This was a waste of time.

16
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,887
I didn't get one either.

17
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,547
Why do I always have the feeling...

18
00:00:55,717 --> 00:00:58,237
...everybody's doing something
better than me on Saturdays?

19
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:00,128
-This is what people do.
-No, they don't.

20
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:02,910
They're out on some big picnic,
they're cooking burgers...

21
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:05,018
...making out on blankets.

22
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:06,782
They're not at some mall in Jersey...

23
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:10,265
...watching their friends trying to find
the world's cheapest air conditioner.

24
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,535
You should see what my father used
to do before he bought a new car.

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,515
He'd go from state to state.
He was away for weeks at a time.

26
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,393
Like he's running for president
and going through the primaries.

27
00:01:19,556 --> 00:01:21,279
We'd get phone calls
from New Hampshire.

28
00:01:21,732 --> 00:01:23,520
We took a little ride,
what's the big deal?

29
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,788
At least you accomplished something.
You got fish.

30
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:27,003
Oh, big accomplishment.

31
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,113
Fish. What do they do?

32
00:01:29,284 --> 00:01:31,804
-What do you do?
-Hey, this way!

33
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:35,548
Jerry, what time do you have?

34
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:37,340
I have 5:00.

35
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:40,474
-Always late. Always late.
-You're not late.

36
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:43,131
I told them to meet me
in front of my building at 6:1 5.

37
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:46,081
-Who?
-My parents. It's their anniversary.

38
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:48,632
I'm taking them out to dinner
and a show tonight.

39
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:51,137
-Think we'll hit traffic?
-Of course. It's rush hour.

40
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,273
-Isn't it the other way?
-There's no other way.

41
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:55,035
Everybody goes every way
all the time.

42
00:01:55,203 --> 00:01:58,072
-But it's Saturday.
-You got the picnic and burger traffic.

43
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:00,729
-There's picnic traffic?
-As my grandfather used to say:

44
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:02,905
''Sometimes even a picnic's
no picnic.''

45
00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:07,831
I always get myself in this position.
Can't be on time. Gotta rush.

46
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:10,364
What's the matter?

47
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:15,007
I have to go to the bathroom.

48
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,406
Why do they hide the bathrooms
in these malls?

49
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:21,207
-You want me to help you with that?
-No, I got it.

50
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,354
What do you think, Georgie boy?

51
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,230
Did I need that pointed out for me?

52
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:34,392
What is that gonna do for me?
How does that help me, to see her?

53
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:36,950
I'm trying to live my life.
Don't show me that.

54
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:38,909
Well, if you like her,
go and talk to her.

55
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:41,461
Yeah, women love to get approached
in parking garages.

56
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:45,178
I'll go up and say, ''Hi, how you doing?
Would you like a glass of white wine?''

57
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:48,279
You get within 1 5 feet, she'd have
her finger on the Mace button.

58
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,717
That was a guy.

59
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,247
-That was a guy?
-Where's the car?

60
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:55,066
Well, I thought it was here.

61
00:02:55,232 --> 00:02:57,436
You don't know where we parked?

62
00:02:58,752 --> 00:03:02,068
-Oh, this is great.
-Look, I thought it was Green 22.

63
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,312
I remember Orange.
I thought it was Orange.

64
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:07,358
-I didn't pay attention.
-This is just what I need.

65
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,948
I'm sure it's right around here.

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,192
Yeah, it looks familiar.
I remember the elevator.

67
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:15,188
There's elevators all over!
Everything looks the same!

68
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:18,141
We're like rats in some experiment.

69
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:21,180
It's over there. I know where it is.

70
00:03:21,983 --> 00:03:24,536
-It's black, right?
-Well, it's dark brown.

71
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:27,004
In a parking lot, you write it down.
How hard is that?

72
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,540
There it is.

73
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:30,077
No, no.

74
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,126
That's a Toyota.

75
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:36,989
-I thought it was....
-Hey, didn't we come in over there?

76
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:41,213
I thought we came in over there.

77
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:44,755
How long can fish live
in one of these plastic bags?

78
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:47,162
I don't know. Maybe two hours.

79
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:49,656
You better find this car.

80
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:51,316
Let's try this way.

81
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:54,452
I really have to go to the bathroom.

82
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,884
Why don't you just go
behind one of these cars.

83
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:01,592
-Why? There's nobody around.
-I'll wait.

84
00:04:01,757 --> 00:04:05,172
You hold it in like that, you can cause
a lot of damage to your bladder.

85
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:07,032
That's what happens to truck drivers.

86
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,106
They hold it in all the time
and eventually...

87
00:04:09,277 --> 00:04:12,091
-...it starts to come out involuntarily.
-All right.

88
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:17,298
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers
are a $600-million-a-year industry?

89
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:20,697
Maybe I should just go any time I get
the urge, like you, wherever I am.

90
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,024
There's too much urinary freedom
in this society. I'm proud to hold it in.

91
00:04:24,188 --> 00:04:25,366
It builds character.

92
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,386
-Is that it?
-No.

93
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,075
Hey! Watch it!

94
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:32,112
Maniac.

95
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:36,662
You sure you don't want help
with that?

96
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:39,195
I'm gonna put it down
behind that car.

97
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:42,194
Worried somebody's
gonna pee on it?

98
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,868
-It's Purple 23. Remember that.
-Oh, I got it.

99
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:54,831
That I'm supposed to remember.
Where the car is, that's insignificant.

100
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,233
I think they're laboring.

101
00:04:57,402 --> 00:05:00,304
Look at this place! It's huge!

102
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:05,299
All right, let me say this to you:

103
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:09,776
lf I am not in front of my building
at 6:1 5, when my parents get there...

104
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:12,531
...they're gonna put me on
an aggravation installment plan...

105
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:14,803
...that will compound, with interest,
for decades.

106
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,464
Parents never forget a foul-up.

107
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:19,154
I once left my jacket on a bus
when I was 1 4.

108
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:22,224
I was flying to Chicago,
last week, on a plane:

109
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:24,084
''Make sure you hang on
to your jacket.''

110
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:25,656
There's no way you can call them?

111
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:28,599
-Yeah, I'll call them on their car phone.
-What would it take...

112
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,631
-...for his parents to get a car phone?
-Hypnosis by aliens.

113
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:34,649
-Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
-We need a system.

114
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,053
Well, it's gotta be here.

115
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:38,453
Why are they using so many colors?

116
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:41,235
The numbers go up to 40.

117
00:05:41,497 --> 00:05:43,918
Maybe it's not on this level.

118
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:47,761
-What?
-There's four different levels.

119
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:49,684
Maybe we're on the wrong level.

120
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:52,815
-How long was the escalator ride up?
-It felt like a couple of levels.

121
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:55,024
You should always bring
a pad and a pen.

122
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:57,811
I can't carry a pen.
I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.

123
00:05:57,976 --> 00:05:59,286
I got a pen.

124
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:01,586
Where is the bathroom in this mall?

125
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:04,207
There's 600 stores,
I didn't see one bathroom.

126
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,750
What is this, like, a joke?

127
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:09,588
Don't they consult with a urologist
when they build one of these places?

128
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:14,415
-What's with you?
-My ear itches.

129
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,234
Don't you dare talk to me like that,
you hear me?

130
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:21,141
I told you, I don't care!
You'll have to wait!

131
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:23,791
Hey, hey, is that really necessary?

132
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,868
Why don't you mind
your own business.

133
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,268
Well, I think hitting a defenseless child
is my business.

134
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,438
-You're ugly.
-What?

135
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:33,395
-You're ugly.
-You are.

136
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:35,533
-You are.
-That's what you think.

137
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:37,906
That's what I know.

138
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,485
-I found it!
-He's got it!

139
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:50,187
-No, no, no.
-All right, that's it.

140
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:54,002
From now on, no more calling out
''I found it'' unless we're sitting in it.

141
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,140
Jerry, look at my fish.

142
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,698
-His eyes look a little cloudy.
-See?

143
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:00,811
Oh, those are your eyes.

144
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:02,800
Oh, they are gonna be furious.

145
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,623
-Who's got the tickets?
-I do.

146
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:06,033
I thought you knew this mall.

147
00:07:06,197 --> 00:07:08,335
-You said you'd been here.
-It was easy last time.

148
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:10,738
Okay, my fish are dying
right in front of me.

149
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:13,999
We've gotta get someone to drive us
around to us help look for the car.

150
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:16,587
No one's gonna do that.

151
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,867
Excuse me. Hi.

152
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:23,251
We can't seem to find our car. I was
wondering if it would be possible...

153
00:07:23,413 --> 00:07:26,926
...to drive us around the garage
for five minutes so we can look.

154
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:28,718
Sorry.

155
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:31,535
-Just five minutes.
-Can't do it.

156
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,601
We're not skinheads.

157
00:07:38,484 --> 00:07:41,615
Excuse me.
I can't seem to find my car.

158
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,235
Do you think you could drive me--?

159
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:49,673
Oh, that's funny? Is that funny?
Hey, tell me if you think this is funny:

160
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:52,810
These fish are dying.

161
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:55,823
In an hour they'll be belly-up!

162
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:59,049
Excuse me.

163
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:01,257
Excuse me.

164
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:05,000
Hey, sorry to have disturbed you.
Terribly sorry.

165
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:08,269
But the fish will be dead!
You do know that?

166
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:10,768
They can't live in plastic.

167
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,192
That's not me talking,
that's science!

168
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:17,169
It's amazing how shopping
makes me have to go.

169
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,047
How does my bladder know
I'm in a department store?

170
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,282
Why don't you just go.

171
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,977
No, I can't.

172
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:27,080
-Don't you get tired of following rules?
-You think I'm too cautious?

173
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,184
Why be uncomfortable
if you don't have to?

174
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:33,256
-It's organic.
-Organic. So is Buddy Hackett.

175
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:35,662
-Buddy Hackett?
-He's a comedian.

176
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,067
I know.

177
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:41,000
-All right, all right.
-Hey, you can go over here.

178
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:44,585
I can manage.

179
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,429
George!

180
00:08:57,744 --> 00:08:58,954
-Okay, let's go.
-But--

181
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,462
Come on.

182
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,762
Kramer.

183
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,314
I'm telling you, I've had this condition
since I was 11 years old.

184
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,745
I've been in and out of hospitals
my whole life.

185
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:14,821
I have no control over it.

186
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:17,380
Doctors have told me
that when I feel it...

187
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:19,493
...the best thing to do
is just release it.

188
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:21,257
Otherwise...

189
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:22,798
...I could die.

190
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:24,933
Do you hear what
I'm saying to you?

191
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:28,747
I'm telling you
that if I don't go, I could die.

192
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:31,464
Die! Is it worth dying for?

193
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:35,014
-That's up to you.
-Oh, so you don't care if I die.

194
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:38,663
What I care about is the sanitary
condition of the parking facility.

195
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,870
Why would I do it
unless I was in mortal danger?

196
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,046
-I know it's against the law.
-I don't know.

197
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:46,990
Because I could get ''uromysitisis''
poisoning and die, that's why.

198
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,983
You think I enjoy living like this?

199
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,833
The shame? The humiliation?

200
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:56,234
You know, I've been issued
a public urination pass...

201
00:09:56,398 --> 00:09:58,154
...by the city
because of my condition.

202
00:09:58,318 --> 00:10:01,701
Unfortunately, my little brother ran out
of the house with it this morning.

203
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:04,749
Him and his friends are probably
peeing all over the place.

204
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:07,844
Jerry!

205
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:11,596
Jerry!

206
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:13,546
Unbelievable.

207
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,814
I'm never gonna get out of here.

208
00:10:16,173 --> 00:10:17,831
Guy goes to pee,
he never comes back.

209
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:19,590
It's like a science-fiction story.

210
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:22,500
Maybe he went
to one of the other levels.

211
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,578
-I'm gonna look for him.
-Now you're gonna go?

212
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:26,537
-Be back in five minutes.
-lf you go now...

213
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:30,214
...we'll find the car, Jerry will show up
and we'll never find you!

214
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,268
I'll be right back.

215
00:10:33,804 --> 00:10:37,000
What's the difference?
We'll all be dead eventually.

216
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,844
Does that bother you?

217
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,180
Yeah, it bothers me.

218
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:45,609
-Doesn't it bother you?
-Not at all.

219
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:48,168
Now, that bothers me even more
than dying bothers me.

220
00:10:48,332 --> 00:10:50,219
Because people like you
live to be 1 20...

221
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:52,038
...because you're not bothered by it.

222
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:53,894
How can it not bother you?

223
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:58,336
Well, I once saw this thing on TV
with people who are terminally ill.

224
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:00,743
Every one of them believed
that the secret of life...

225
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:02,598
...is just to live every moment.

226
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,486
Yeah, I've heard that.

227
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:08,645
Meanwhile, I'm here with you
in a parking garage in Jersey.

228
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:11,402
That's a nice jacket.
Where'd you get that?

229
00:11:11,563 --> 00:11:14,629
Some guy left it
over at my mother's house.

230
00:11:14,795 --> 00:11:18,504
First of all, you don't even know,
technically, that I went.

231
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,975
That's for starters.

232
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,821
I mean, I could have been pouring
a bottle of water out there.

233
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:26,409
-I know what you did.
-Oh, really? Do you? Well...

234
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,904
...it just so happens
that I did pour water out.

235
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:32,644
I had a bottle of very tepid water
and I poured it out.

236
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,402
I could see how you made
a mistake...

237
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,629
...because pouring water out sounds
very much like a person urinating.

238
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:40,801
And, you know,
when you think about it...

239
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,198
...it's really quite an amusing case
of mistaken identity.

240
00:11:44,362 --> 00:11:45,922
And that's all it is.

241
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,937
And now he's gone.
I'm sure he's looking for the car.

242
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:51,202
Five minutes, that's all.
I just wanna find him.

243
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:54,020
-I can't do it.
-But why? Why can't you do it?

244
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:55,591
I can't.

245
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:58,174
That's not a reason, ''You can't.''
You just don't want to.

246
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,910
That's right.

247
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:01,829
But why? Why don't you want to?

248
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:04,161
I don't know.

249
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:07,968
Well, wouldn't you get any satisfaction
out of helping someone out?

250
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:10,722
No, I wouldn't.

251
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:19,266
All right. All right.

252
00:12:19,432 --> 00:12:22,214
l.... I want to apologize.

253
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,750
I was frightened.

254
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:26,017
I said crazy things,
I obviously offended you...

255
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:28,256
...I insulted your intelligence.

256
00:12:28,424 --> 00:12:31,490
The uromysitisis, the water bottle...

257
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:33,379
...I made all that up.

258
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:35,747
And now I'm gonna
tell you the truth.

259
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:39,654
Today my parents are celebrating...

260
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:43,164
...their 50th--
Well, I'm jumping ahead here.

261
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:45,723
Their 4 7th wedding anniversary.

262
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:49,091
And we made plans to spend
the evening together.

263
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:52,156
They're meeting me
in front of my building at 6:1 5.

264
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:54,236
What I haven't told you...

265
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:56,989
...or anyone else, for that matter...

266
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:00,388
...is that my father's been
in a Red Chinese prison...

267
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,655
...for the past 1 4 years.

268
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,898
I mean, the guy had a fat fetish.

269
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:08,410
The inspector never dated a woman
under 250 pounds.

270
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:12,160
-Really.
-What did he do with all that fat?

271
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:14,300
Does he just jump up
and down on it?

272
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:17,152
Or does he gouge it
like Killer Kowalski?

273
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:19,619
-Who's Killer Kowalski?
-He was a wrestler.

274
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:21,210
He would get down on his knees...

275
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,486
...and he'd grab ahold
of someone's stomach...

276
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:25,059
...and squeeze it till they gave.

277
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,254
Hey, hey, hey.
I have to go to the bathroom.

278
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:29,981
Why don't you just go.

279
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,122
What, here?

280
00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:34,975
You and Jerry. It's....

281
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:37,922
Okay.

282
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:40,729
All right, I'm gonna
go down this row.

283
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:56,221
What? What did I do?
I didn't do anything.

284
00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:59,770
Kramer! Kramer!

285
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:06,147
What? Don't you believe me?
It's their 4 7th anniversary.

286
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:08,028
You know, this is gonna kill them.

287
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:10,235
You're aware of that? Kill them.

288
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:12,094
On the biggest night of their life.

289
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,811
Your folks have
an anniversary today too?

290
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,251
Was your father also
in a Red Chinese prison?

291
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,080
Red Chinese prison?

292
00:14:24,386 --> 00:14:27,168
George!

293
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:29,979
George!

294
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:32,796
Jerry!

295
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:37,302
Jerry!

296
00:14:37,986 --> 00:14:39,840
You know when you're walking
with someone...

297
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:42,936
...and you assume
that they know where the car is?

298
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:47,361
And you're fine until you see them
do this move. Once they do this:

299
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:54,872
When they look back from
where they came from....

300
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,219
No, you're in bad shape now.

301
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:59,680
Nobody that knows
where they're going does that.

302
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:03,802
Pilots on planes don't open
the cockpit door and go:

303
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:07,326
Well, what happened was...

304
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:10,619
...my father was staying with
one of China's great military leaders...

305
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,370
...General Chang, who, by the way,
came up with the recipe...

306
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,700
...for General Chang's chicken. The
one with red pepper and orange peel...

307
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:19,003
-...at Szechwan Gardens?
-I eat it all the time. Spicy.

308
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,175
Apparently, General Chang
is a flamboyant man.

309
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:24,213
Complete failure as a general,
but a hell of a cook.

310
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:26,870
Look at this.

311
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,494
Look at this. Will you look at this?

312
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:33,340
He doesn't have enough with the
Mercedes, he has to have two spaces.

313
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:36,536
I tell you, you know what I'd like
to do? I'd like to spit on it.

314
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,459
I would like to see that.

315
00:15:38,623 --> 00:15:41,438
-Should l? Should I do it?
-Teach him a lesson he'll never forget.

316
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:43,835
-Who does he think he is?
-Someone's gotta stop him.

317
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:47,130
-It's against the law, isn't it?
-Well, it certainly should be.

318
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,560
Okay.

319
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,002
This is some machine.

320
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,371
Leave it to the Germans.

321
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:00,275
Let me ask you something.

322
00:16:00,446 --> 00:16:02,934
What do they get
for a tune-up on this?

323
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,316
-Jerry!
-Elaine!

324
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:08,696
Where have you been?

325
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:11,284
-I was arrested for urinating.
-Me too.

326
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:13,690
-You what?
-I have uromysitisis.

327
00:16:13,854 --> 00:16:15,315
It's very serious, you know.

328
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:17,209
Jerry, look at my fish.

329
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:21,275
-Is he...?
-No, but he's not looking good.

330
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:25,175
Please. We can't find our car.

331
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:28,756
Please, just drive us around
the parking lot to find our car.

332
00:16:28,925 --> 00:16:30,997
-My fish are dying.
-Sorry. Can't do it.

333
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:33,848
I can see not caring
what happens to us. We're human.

334
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:37,275
But what about the fish? The fish?

335
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:38,778
Sorry.

336
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:40,694
That's right, go.

337
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,584
Go home to your dumbbells.

338
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:47,320
Go work on your pecs and your lats.
We're all really impressed.

339
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:49,557
Yeah, that's right. You heard me.

340
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:53,979
-You got a problem with that?
-Elaine, shut up.

341
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,206
Don't worry, I'm packing heat.

342
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,090
Hey, hey. Where's Kramer?

343
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,016
-I don't know.
-I thought he was with you.

344
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,089
Oh, see? See? I knew
this was gonna happen.

345
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,918
Look at the time. All right, that's it.

346
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:07,026
Did we look over there?
We check that side?

347
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:09,748
-We came in over there.
-We didn't come in over there.

348
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:11,638
-Where's Kramer?
-Look at these cars...

349
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:13,210
...they all look exactly alike.

350
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:18,775
The fumes.

351
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,248
I can't breathe.

352
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,312
I'm having trouble breathing.

353
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,972
Hey, George, there she is again.

354
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,726
What are you doing?
You're killing me.

355
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:35,671
Ask her to drive us around.
There's your opening.

356
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,370
That is an opening.

357
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,232
Excuse me. I'm really....

358
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:46,995
See, what happened...

359
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:50,773
-...my friend forgot where he parked....
-Sure, I'll drive you around.

360
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:52,631
-You will?
-Sure.

361
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:54,419
Thank you. Thank you.

362
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:58,066
We're late and my parents are waiting
for me and we're stuck here.

363
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:01,135
Well, I wouldn't wanna get lost in here.
It smells like a toilet.

364
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:03,607
-People are such animals.
-You're telling me.

365
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:05,078
Filthy pigs.

366
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:07,608
It's a brown Ford.

367
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:10,289
This has happened to me too.
It's very frustrating.

368
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:13,972
I've asked several people.
They wouldn't even answer me.

369
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:16,525
I'm happy to do it.

370
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:18,868
I'm Michele.

371
00:18:19,353 --> 00:18:22,800
Hi, Michele. I'm George.

372
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:35,248
-Get out!
-But I didn't mean anything by it.

373
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:39,987
I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard.
I didn't know you were with that group.

374
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:41,940
What about my fish?

375
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:45,038
Boy, those Scientologists,
they can be pretty sensitive.

376
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,930
I'll say.

377
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:49,812
What is it? The car!

378
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:51,764
-The car!
-The car!

379
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:56,204
-The car!
-I can't believe it!

380
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,822
Kramer. Kramer's not here.
I knew it.

381
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:01,649
I knew it. I knew this would happen.

382
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:04,913
-Kramer! Kramer!
-Kramer!

383
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:08,013
Kramer!

384
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,303
Hey, look.

385
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:19,021
Boy, I had a hell of a time finding
that air conditioner.

386
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,717
You know I looked everywhere?

387
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:23,668
I completely forgot where I hid it.

388
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,455
You know where it was?

389
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:29,331
-Purple 23.
-Right. Purple 23.

390
00:19:29,494 --> 00:19:31,021
I could have used you.

391
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:33,644
Sometimes it's good to write
those things down.

392
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:36,496
Oh, boy. What time is it?

393
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:38,287
7:45.

394
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:42,477
Well, at least there'll be no traffic.

395
00:19:43,444 --> 00:19:44,819
Right.

396
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:47,534
Oh, boy.

397
00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:52,717
-What time does that play start?
-8:00.

398
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,602
Well, that could be a problem.

399
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:59,023
Where's your little bag of....

400
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,596
All right, let's giddyup.

401
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,275
See, the problem
with the mall garage...

402
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:30,826
...is that everything looks the same.

403
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:33,033
They try to differentiate it.

404
00:20:33,203 --> 00:20:36,236
They put up different colors,
different numbers, different letters.

405
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,377
What they need to do
is name the levels like:

406
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:40,586
''Your mother's a whore.''
You know what I mean?

407
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:42,314
You would remember that.

408
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:45,417
You'd go, ''I know, I'm parked at
'My father's an abusive alcoholic.'

409
00:20:45,587 --> 00:20:47,474
I know where I parked.''

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
1
00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:04,353
It's hard to find a store in a mall.
They have a directory...

2
00:00:05,863 --> 00:00:09,158
...but the problem with it is,
even if you figure out where you are...

3
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:11,206
...and where you wanna go...

4
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:14,400
...you still don't really know,
sometimes, which way to walk...

5
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:16,835
...because it's an upright map.

6
00:00:16,998 --> 00:00:20,544
lf you had, like, suction-cup feet,
then you could just walk right up on it.

7
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:24,420
Then you could tell, you could be
on it going, ''All right, I'm here.

8
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:26,371
I wanna go to the Gap.
That's down there.

9
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:28,061
All right, I'll just walk that way.''

10
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:35,235
But people would know. They would
see you walking down the mall going:

11
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,467
They'd go, ''That's one
of those suction-cup guys.

12
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:42,339
I heard about that guy.
He's never lost.''

13
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:47,546
One left. What a joke.

14
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:49,921
-You can have this one.
-That's not enough BTUs...

15
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:52,506
...for my living room.
This was a waste of time.

16
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,887
I didn't get one either.

17
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,547
Why do I always have the feeling...

18
00:00:55,717 --> 00:00:58,237
...everybody's doing something
better than me on Saturdays?

19
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:00,128
-This is what people do.
-No, they don't.

20
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:02,910
They're out on some big picnic,
they're cooking burgers...

21
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:05,018
...making out on blankets.

22
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:06,782
They're not at some mall in Jersey...

23
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:10,265
...watching their friends trying to find
the world's cheapest air conditioner.

24
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:13,535
You should see what my father used
to do before he bought a new car.

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,515
He'd go from state to state.
He was away for weeks at a time.

26
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,393
Like he's running for president
and going through the primaries.

27
00:01:19,556 --> 00:01:21,279
We'd get phone calls
from New Hampshire.

28
00:01:21,732 --> 00:01:23,520
We took a little ride,
what's the big deal?

29
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,788
At least you accomplished something.
You got fish.

30
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:27,003
Oh, big accomplishment.

31
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:29,113
Fish. What do they do?

32
00:01:29,284 --> 00:01:31,804
-What do you do?
-Hey, this way!

33
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:35,548
Jerry, what time do you have?

34
00:01:35,715 --> 00:01:37,340
I have 5:00.

35
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:40,474
-Always late. Always late.
-You're not late.

36
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:43,131
I told them to meet me
in front of my building at 6:1 5.

37
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:46,081
-Who?
-My parents. It's their anniversary.

38
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:48,632
I'm taking them out to dinner
and a show tonight.

39
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:51,137
-Think we'll hit traffic?
-Of course. It's rush hour.

40
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:53,273
-Isn't it the other way?
-There's no other way.

41
00:01:53,442 --> 00:01:55,035
Everybody goes every way
all the time.

42
00:01:55,203 --> 00:01:58,072
-But it's Saturday.
-You got the picnic and burger traffic.

43
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:00,729
-There's picnic traffic?
-As my grandfather used to say:

44
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:02,905
''Sometimes even a picnic's
no picnic.''

45
00:02:03,074 --> 00:02:07,831
I always get myself in this position.
Can't be on time. Gotta rush.

46
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:10,364
What's the matter?

47
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:15,007
I have to go to the bathroom.

48
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:17,406
Why do they hide the bathrooms
in these malls?

49
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:21,207
-You want me to help you with that?
-No, I got it.

50
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,354
What do you think, Georgie boy?

51
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,230
Did I need that pointed out for me?

52
00:02:31,393 --> 00:02:34,392
What is that gonna do for me?
How does that help me, to see her?

53
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:36,950
I'm trying to live my life.
Don't show me that.

54
00:02:37,121 --> 00:02:38,909
Well, if you like her,
go and talk to her.

55
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:41,461
Yeah, women love to get approached
in parking garages.

56
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:45,178
I'll go up and say, ''Hi, how you doing?
Would you like a glass of white wine?''

57
00:02:45,344 --> 00:02:48,279
You get within 1 5 feet, she'd have
her finger on the Mace button.

58
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,717
That was a guy.

59
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,247
-That was a guy?
-Where's the car?

60
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:55,066
Well, I thought it was here.

61
00:02:55,232 --> 00:02:57,436
You don't know where we parked?

62
00:02:58,752 --> 00:03:02,068
-Oh, this is great.
-Look, I thought it was Green 22.

63
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,312
I remember Orange.
I thought it was Orange.

64
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:07,358
-I didn't pay attention.
-This is just what I need.

65
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,948
I'm sure it's right around here.

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,192
Yeah, it looks familiar.
I remember the elevator.

67
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:15,188
There's elevators all over!
Everything looks the same!

68
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:18,141
We're like rats in some experiment.

69
00:03:18,463 --> 00:03:21,180
It's over there. I know where it is.

70
00:03:21,983 --> 00:03:24,536
-It's black, right?
-Well, it's dark brown.

71
00:03:24,702 --> 00:03:27,004
In a parking lot, you write it down.
How hard is that?

72
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,540
There it is.

73
00:03:28,702 --> 00:03:30,077
No, no.

74
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,126
That's a Toyota.

75
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:36,989
-I thought it was....
-Hey, didn't we come in over there?

76
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:41,213
I thought we came in over there.

77
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:44,755
How long can fish live
in one of these plastic bags?

78
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:47,162
I don't know. Maybe two hours.

79
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:49,656
You better find this car.

80
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:51,316
Let's try this way.

81
00:03:51,485 --> 00:03:54,452
I really have to go to the bathroom.

82
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:57,884
Why don't you just go
behind one of these cars.

83
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:01,592
-Why? There's nobody around.
-I'll wait.

84
00:04:01,757 --> 00:04:05,172
You hold it in like that, you can cause
a lot of damage to your bladder.

85
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:07,032
That's what happens to truck drivers.

86
00:04:07,197 --> 00:04:09,106
They hold it in all the time
and eventually...

87
00:04:09,277 --> 00:04:12,091
-...it starts to come out involuntarily.
-All right.

88
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:17,298
Jerry, are you aware that adult diapers
are a $600-million-a-year industry?

89
00:04:17,468 --> 00:04:20,697
Maybe I should just go any time I get
the urge, like you, wherever I am.

90
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,024
There's too much urinary freedom
in this society. I'm proud to hold it in.

91
00:04:24,188 --> 00:04:25,366
It builds character.

92
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,386
-Is that it?
-No.

93
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,075
Hey! Watch it!

94
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:32,112
Maniac.

95
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:36,662
You sure you don't want help
with that?

96
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:39,195
I'm gonna put it down
behind that car.

97
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:42,194
Worried somebody's
gonna pee on it?

98
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:50,868
-It's Purple 23. Remember that.
-Oh, I got it.

99
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:54,831
That I'm supposed to remember.
Where the car is, that's insignificant.

100
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,233
I think they're laboring.

101
00:04:57,402 --> 00:05:00,304
Look at this place! It's huge!

102
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:05,299
All right, let me say this to you:

103
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:09,776
lf I am not in front of my building
at 6:1 5, when my parents get there...

104
00:05:09,946 --> 00:05:12,531
...they're gonna put me on
an aggravation installment plan...

105
00:05:12,698 --> 00:05:14,803
...that will compound, with interest,
for decades.

106
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,464
Parents never forget a foul-up.

107
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:19,154
I once left my jacket on a bus
when I was 1 4.

108
00:05:19,322 --> 00:05:22,224
I was flying to Chicago,
last week, on a plane:

109
00:05:22,394 --> 00:05:24,084
''Make sure you hang on
to your jacket.''

110
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:25,656
There's no way you can call them?

111
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:28,599
-Yeah, I'll call them on their car phone.
-What would it take...

112
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:31,631
-...for his parents to get a car phone?
-Hypnosis by aliens.

113
00:05:31,802 --> 00:05:34,649
-Where the hell is this car, Kramer?
-We need a system.

114
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,053
Well, it's gotta be here.

115
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:38,453
Why are they using so many colors?

116
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:41,235
The numbers go up to 40.

117
00:05:41,497 --> 00:05:43,918
Maybe it's not on this level.

118
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:47,761
-What?
-There's four different levels.

119
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:49,684
Maybe we're on the wrong level.

120
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:52,815
-How long was the escalator ride up?
-It felt like a couple of levels.

121
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:55,024
You should always bring
a pad and a pen.

122
00:05:55,193 --> 00:05:57,811
I can't carry a pen.
I'm afraid I'll puncture my scrotum.

123
00:05:57,976 --> 00:05:59,286
I got a pen.

124
00:05:59,448 --> 00:06:01,586
Where is the bathroom in this mall?

125
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:04,207
There's 600 stores,
I didn't see one bathroom.

126
00:06:04,376 --> 00:06:05,750
What is this, like, a joke?

127
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:09,588
Don't they consult with a urologist
when they build one of these places?

128
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:14,415
-What's with you?
-My ear itches.

129
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,234
Don't you dare talk to me like that,
you hear me?

130
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:21,141
I told you, I don't care!
You'll have to wait!

131
00:06:21,303 --> 00:06:23,791
Hey, hey, is that really necessary?

132
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,868
Why don't you mind
your own business.

133
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,268
Well, I think hitting a defenseless child
is my business.

134
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,438
-You're ugly.
-What?

135
00:06:31,607 --> 00:06:33,395
-You're ugly.
-You are.

136
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:35,533
-You are.
-That's what you think.

137
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:37,906
That's what I know.

138
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,485
-I found it!
-He's got it!

139
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:50,187
-No, no, no.
-All right, that's it.

140
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:54,002
From now on, no more calling out
''I found it'' unless we're sitting in it.

141
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,140
Jerry, look at my fish.

142
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,698
-His eyes look a little cloudy.
-See?

143
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:00,811
Oh, those are your eyes.

144
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:02,800
Oh, they are gonna be furious.

145
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,623
-Who's got the tickets?
-I do.

146
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:06,033
I thought you knew this mall.

147
00:07:06,197 --> 00:07:08,335
-You said you'd been here.
-It was easy last time.

148
00:07:08,501 --> 00:07:10,738
Okay, my fish are dying
right in front of me.

149
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:13,999
We've gotta get someone to drive us
around to us help look for the car.

150
00:07:14,165 --> 00:07:16,587
No one's gonna do that.

151
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,867
Excuse me. Hi.

152
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:23,251
We can't seem to find our car. I was
wondering if it would be possible...

153
00:07:23,413 --> 00:07:26,926
...to drive us around the garage
for five minutes so we can look.

154
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:28,718
Sorry.

155
00:07:28,884 --> 00:07:31,535
-Just five minutes.
-Can't do it.

156
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,601
We're not skinheads.

157
00:07:38,484 --> 00:07:41,615
Excuse me.
I can't seem to find my car.

158
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,235
Do you think you could drive me--?

159
00:07:44,403 --> 00:07:49,673
Oh, that's funny? Is that funny?
Hey, tell me if you think this is funny:

160
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:52,810
These fish are dying.

161
00:07:53,587 --> 00:07:55,823
In an hour they'll be belly-up!

162
00:07:57,075 --> 00:07:59,049
Excuse me.

163
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:01,257
Excuse me.

164
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:05,000
Hey, sorry to have disturbed you.
Terribly sorry.

165
00:08:05,171 --> 00:08:08,269
But the fish will be dead!
You do know that?

166
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:10,768
They can't live in plastic.

167
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,192
That's not me talking,
that's science!

168
00:08:14,354 --> 00:08:17,169
It's amazing how shopping
makes me have to go.

169
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,047
How does my bladder know
I'm in a department store?

170
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,282
Why don't you just go.

171
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,977
No, I can't.

172
00:08:24,145 --> 00:08:27,080
-Don't you get tired of following rules?
-You think I'm too cautious?

173
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,184
Why be uncomfortable
if you don't have to?

174
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:33,256
-It's organic.
-Organic. So is Buddy Hackett.

175
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:35,662
-Buddy Hackett?
-He's a comedian.

176
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,067
I know.

177
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:41,000
-All right, all right.
-Hey, you can go over here.

178
00:08:42,545 --> 00:08:44,585
I can manage.

179
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,429
George!

180
00:08:57,744 --> 00:08:58,954
-Okay, let's go.
-But--

181
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,462
Come on.

182
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:02,762
Kramer.

183
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,314
I'm telling you, I've had this condition
since I was 11 years old.

184
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,745
I've been in and out of hospitals
my whole life.

185
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:14,821
I have no control over it.

186
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:17,380
Doctors have told me
that when I feel it...

187
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:19,493
...the best thing to do
is just release it.

188
00:09:19,664 --> 00:09:21,257
Otherwise...

189
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:22,798
...I could die.

190
00:09:23,471 --> 00:09:24,933
Do you hear what
I'm saying to you?

191
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:28,747
I'm telling you
that if I don't go, I could die.

192
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:31,464
Die! Is it worth dying for?

193
00:09:31,631 --> 00:09:35,014
-That's up to you.
-Oh, so you don't care if I die.

194
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:38,663
What I care about is the sanitary
condition of the parking facility.

195
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,870
Why would I do it
unless I was in mortal danger?

196
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,046
-I know it's against the law.
-I don't know.

197
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:46,990
Because I could get ''uromysitisis''
poisoning and die, that's why.

198
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,983
You think I enjoy living like this?

199
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,833
The shame? The humiliation?

200
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:56,234
You know, I've been issued
a public urination pass...

201
00:09:56,398 --> 00:09:58,154
...by the city
because of my condition.

202
00:09:58,318 --> 00:10:01,701
Unfortunately, my little brother ran out
of the house with it this morning.

203
00:10:01,902 --> 00:10:04,749
Him and his friends are probably
peeing all over the place.

204
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:07,844
Jerry!

205
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:11,596
Jerry!

206
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:13,546
Unbelievable.

207
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:15,814
I'm never gonna get out of here.

208
00:10:16,173 --> 00:10:17,831
Guy goes to pee,
he never comes back.

209
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:19,590
It's like a science-fiction story.

210
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:22,500
Maybe he went
to one of the other levels.

211
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:24,578
-I'm gonna look for him.
-Now you're gonna go?

212
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:26,537
-Be back in five minutes.
-lf you go now...

213
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:30,214
...we'll find the car, Jerry will show up
and we'll never find you!

214
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,268
I'll be right back.

215
00:10:33,804 --> 00:10:37,000
What's the difference?
We'll all be dead eventually.

216
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,844
Does that bother you?

217
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,180
Yeah, it bothers me.

218
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:45,609
-Doesn't it bother you?
-Not at all.

219
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:48,168
Now, that bothers me even more
than dying bothers me.

220
00:10:48,332 --> 00:10:50,219
Because people like you
live to be 1 20...

221
00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:52,038
...because you're not bothered by it.

222
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:53,894
How can it not bother you?

223
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:58,336
Well, I once saw this thing on TV
with people who are terminally ill.

224
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:00,743
Every one of them believed
that the secret of life...

225
00:11:00,907 --> 00:11:02,598
...is just to live every moment.

226
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:04,486
Yeah, I've heard that.

227
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:08,645
Meanwhile, I'm here with you
in a parking garage in Jersey.

228
00:11:09,514 --> 00:11:11,402
That's a nice jacket.
Where'd you get that?

229
00:11:11,563 --> 00:11:14,629
Some guy left it
over at my mother's house.

230
00:11:14,795 --> 00:11:18,504
First of all, you don't even know,
technically, that I went.

231
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,975
That's for starters.

232
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,821
I mean, I could have been pouring
a bottle of water out there.

233
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:26,409
-I know what you did.
-Oh, really? Do you? Well...

234
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,904
...it just so happens
that I did pour water out.

235
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:32,644
I had a bottle of very tepid water
and I poured it out.

236
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,402
I could see how you made
a mistake...

237
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,629
...because pouring water out sounds
very much like a person urinating.

238
00:11:38,794 --> 00:11:40,801
And, you know,
when you think about it...

239
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,198
...it's really quite an amusing case
of mistaken identity.

240
00:11:44,362 --> 00:11:45,922
And that's all it is.

241
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,937
And now he's gone.
I'm sure he's looking for the car.

242
00:11:49,097 --> 00:11:51,202
Five minutes, that's all.
I just wanna find him.

243
00:11:51,369 --> 00:11:54,020
-I can't do it.
-But why? Why can't you do it?

244
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:55,591
I can't.

245
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:58,174
That's not a reason, ''You can't.''
You just don't want to.

246
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,910
That's right.

247
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:01,829
But why? Why don't you want to?

248
00:12:02,601 --> 00:12:04,161
I don't know.

249
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:07,968
Well, wouldn't you get any satisfaction
out of helping someone out?

250
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:10,722
No, I wouldn't.

251
00:12:17,128 --> 00:12:19,266
All right. All right.

252
00:12:19,432 --> 00:12:22,214
l.... I want to apologize.

253
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,750
I was frightened.

254
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:26,017
I said crazy things,
I obviously offended you...

255
00:12:26,184 --> 00:12:28,256
...I insulted your intelligence.

256
00:12:28,424 --> 00:12:31,490
The uromysitisis, the water bottle...

257
00:12:31,656 --> 00:12:33,379
...I made all that up.

258
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:35,747
And now I'm gonna
tell you the truth.

259
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:39,654
Today my parents are celebrating...

260
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:43,164
...their 50th--
Well, I'm jumping ahead here.

261
00:12:43,334 --> 00:12:45,723
Their 4 7th wedding anniversary.

262
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:49,091
And we made plans to spend
the evening together.

263
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:52,156
They're meeting me
in front of my building at 6:1 5.

264
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:54,236
What I haven't told you...

265
00:12:54,534 --> 00:12:56,989
...or anyone else, for that matter...

266
00:12:58,087 --> 00:13:00,388
...is that my father's been
in a Red Chinese prison...

267
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,655
...for the past 1 4 years.

268
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,898
I mean, the guy had a fat fetish.

269
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:08,410
The inspector never dated a woman
under 250 pounds.

270
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:12,160
-Really.
-What did he do with all that fat?

271
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:14,300
Does he just jump up
and down on it?

272
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:17,152
Or does he gouge it
like Killer Kowalski?

273
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:19,619
-Who's Killer Kowalski?
-He was a wrestler.

274
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:21,210
He would get down on his knees...

275
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:23,486
...and he'd grab ahold
of someone's stomach...

276
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:25,059
...and squeeze it till they gave.

277
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,254
Hey, hey, hey.
I have to go to the bathroom.

278
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:29,981
Why don't you just go.

279
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,122
What, here?

280
00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:34,975
You and Jerry. It's....

281
00:13:36,581 --> 00:13:37,922
Okay.

282
00:13:38,341 --> 00:13:40,729
All right, I'm gonna
go down this row.

283
00:13:52,676 --> 00:13:56,221
What? What did I do?
I didn't do anything.

284
00:13:56,388 --> 00:13:59,770
Kramer! Kramer!

285
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:06,147
What? Don't you believe me?
It's their 4 7th anniversary.

286
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:08,028
You know, this is gonna kill them.

287
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:10,235
You're aware of that? Kill them.

288
00:14:10,403 --> 00:14:12,094
On the biggest night of their life.

289
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,811
Your folks have
an anniversary today too?

290
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,251
Was your father also
in a Red Chinese prison?

291
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,080
Red Chinese prison?

292
00:14:24,386 --> 00:14:27,168
George!

293
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:29,979
George!

294
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:32,796
Jerry!

295
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:37,302
Jerry!

296
00:14:37,986 --> 00:14:39,840
You know when you're walking
with someone...

297
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:42,936
...and you assume
that they know where the car is?

298
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:47,361
And you're fine until you see them
do this move. Once they do this:

299
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:54,872
When they look back from
where they came from....

300
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,219
No, you're in bad shape now.

301
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:59,680
Nobody that knows
where they're going does that.

302
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:03,802
Pilots on planes don't open
the cockpit door and go:

303
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:07,326
Well, what happened was...

304
00:15:07,488 --> 00:15:10,619
...my father was staying with
one of China's great military leaders...

305
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,370
...General Chang, who, by the way,
came up with the recipe...

306
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,700
...for General Chang's chicken. The
one with red pepper and orange peel...

307
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:19,003
-...at Szechwan Gardens?
-I eat it all the time. Spicy.

308
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,175
Apparently, General Chang
is a flamboyant man.

309
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:24,213
Complete failure as a general,
but a hell of a cook.

310
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:26,870
Look at this.

311
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,494
Look at this. Will you look at this?

312
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:33,340
He doesn't have enough with the
Mercedes, he has to have two spaces.

313
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:36,536
I tell you, you know what I'd like
to do? I'd like to spit on it.

314
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,459
I would like to see that.

315
00:15:38,623 --> 00:15:41,438
-Should l? Should I do it?
-Teach him a lesson he'll never forget.

316
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:43,835
-Who does he think he is?
-Someone's gotta stop him.

317
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:47,130
-It's against the law, isn't it?
-Well, it certainly should be.

318
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,560
Okay.

319
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,002
This is some machine.

320
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:57,371
Leave it to the Germans.

321
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:00,275
Let me ask you something.

322
00:16:00,446 --> 00:16:02,934
What do they get
for a tune-up on this?

323
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,316
-Jerry!
-Elaine!

324
00:16:07,486 --> 00:16:08,696
Where have you been?

325
00:16:08,862 --> 00:16:11,284
-I was arrested for urinating.
-Me too.

326
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:13,690
-You what?
-I have uromysitisis.

327
00:16:13,854 --> 00:16:15,315
It's very serious, you know.

328
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:17,209
Jerry, look at my fish.

329
00:16:17,565 --> 00:16:21,275
-Is he...?
-No, but he's not looking good.

330
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:25,175
Please. We can't find our car.

331
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:28,756
Please, just drive us around
the parking lot to find our car.

332
00:16:28,925 --> 00:16:30,997
-My fish are dying.
-Sorry. Can't do it.

333
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:33,848
I can see not caring
what happens to us. We're human.

334
00:16:34,013 --> 00:16:37,275
But what about the fish? The fish?

335
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:38,778
Sorry.

336
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:40,694
That's right, go.

337
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,584
Go home to your dumbbells.

338
00:16:42,749 --> 00:16:47,320
Go work on your pecs and your lats.
We're all really impressed.

339
00:16:47,484 --> 00:16:49,557
Yeah, that's right. You heard me.

340
00:16:49,724 --> 00:16:53,979
-You got a problem with that?
-Elaine, shut up.

341
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,206
Don't worry, I'm packing heat.

342
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,090
Hey, hey. Where's Kramer?

343
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,016
-I don't know.
-I thought he was with you.

344
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,089
Oh, see? See? I knew
this was gonna happen.

345
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,918
Look at the time. All right, that's it.

346
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:07,026
Did we look over there?
We check that side?

347
00:17:07,195 --> 00:17:09,748
-We came in over there.
-We didn't come in over there.

348
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:11,638
-Where's Kramer?
-Look at these cars...

349
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:13,210
...they all look exactly alike.

350
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:18,775
The fumes.

351
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:20,248
I can't breathe.

352
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,312
I'm having trouble breathing.

353
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,972
Hey, George, there she is again.

354
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,726
What are you doing?
You're killing me.

355
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:35,671
Ask her to drive us around.
There's your opening.

356
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,370
That is an opening.

357
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,232
Excuse me. I'm really....

358
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:46,995
See, what happened...

359
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:50,773
-...my friend forgot where he parked....
-Sure, I'll drive you around.

360
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:52,631
-You will?
-Sure.

361
00:17:53,242 --> 00:17:54,419
Thank you. Thank you.

362
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:58,066
We're late and my parents are waiting
for me and we're stuck here.

363
00:17:58,233 --> 00:18:01,135
Well, I wouldn't wanna get lost in here.
It smells like a toilet.

364
00:18:01,305 --> 00:18:03,607
-People are such animals.
-You're telling me.

365
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:05,078
Filthy pigs.

366
00:18:05,753 --> 00:18:07,608
It's a brown Ford.

367
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:10,289
This has happened to me too.
It's very frustrating.

368
00:18:10,873 --> 00:18:13,972
I've asked several people.
They wouldn't even answer me.

369
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:16,525
I'm happy to do it.

370
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:18,868
I'm Michele.

371
00:18:19,353 --> 00:18:22,800
Hi, Michele. I'm George.

372
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:35,248
-Get out!
-But I didn't mean anything by it.

373
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:39,987
I don't even know L. Ron Hubbard.
I didn't know you were with that group.

374
00:18:40,151 --> 00:18:41,940
What about my fish?

375
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:45,038
Boy, those Scientologists,
they can be pretty sensitive.

376
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,930
I'll say.

377
00:18:47,095 --> 00:18:49,812
What is it? The car!

378
00:18:49,975 --> 00:18:51,764
-The car!
-The car!

379
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:56,204
-The car!
-I can't believe it!

380
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:59,822
Kramer. Kramer's not here.
I knew it.

381
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:01,649
I knew it. I knew this would happen.

382
00:19:01,814 --> 00:19:04,913
-Kramer! Kramer!
-Kramer!

383
00:19:05,558 --> 00:19:08,013
Kramer!

384
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,303
Hey, look.

385
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:19,021
Boy, I had a hell of a time finding
that air conditioner.

386
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,717
You know I looked everywhere?

387
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:23,668
I completely forgot where I hid it.

388
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,455
You know where it was?

389
00:19:25,621 --> 00:19:29,331
-Purple 23.
-Right. Purple 23.

390
00:19:29,494 --> 00:19:31,021
I could have used you.

391
00:19:31,189 --> 00:19:33,644
Sometimes it's good to write
those things down.

392
00:19:33,813 --> 00:19:36,496
Oh, boy. What time is it?

393
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:38,287
7:45.

394
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:42,477
Well, at least there'll be no traffic.

395
00:19:43,444 --> 00:19:44,819
Right.

396
00:19:45,909 --> 00:19:47,534
Oh, boy.

397
00:19:50,645 --> 00:19:52,717
-What time does that play start?
-8:00.

398
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,602
Well, that could be a problem.

399
00:19:56,852 --> 00:19:59,023
Where's your little bag of....

400
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:03,596
All right, let's giddyup.

401
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,275
See, the problem
with the mall garage...

402
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:30,826
...is that everything looks the same.

403
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:33,033
They try to differentiate it.

404
00:20:33,203 --> 00:20:36,236
They put up different colors,
different numbers, different letters.

405
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,377
What they need to do
is name the levels like:

406
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:40,586
''Your mother's a whore.''
You know what I mean?

407
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:42,314
You would remember that.

408
00:20:42,482 --> 00:20:45,417
You'd go, ''I know, I'm parked at
'My father's an abusive alcoholic.'

409
00:20:45,587 --> 00:20:47,474
I know where I parked.''
